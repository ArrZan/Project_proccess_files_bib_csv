abstract={Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.},

abstract={Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted.

abstract={In recent years, a paradigm shift has occurred regarding the way organizations view risk management. Instead of looking at risk management from a silo-based perspective, the trend is to take a holistic view of risk management. This holistic approach toward managing an organization's risk is commonly referred to as enterprise risk management (ERM). Indeed, there is growing support for the general argument that organizations will improve their performance by employing the ERM concept. The basic argument presented in this paper is that the relation between ERM and firm performance is contingent upon the appropriate match between ERM and the following five factors affecting a firm: environmental uncertainty, industry competition, firm size, firm complexity, and board of directors' monitoring. Based on a sample of 112 US firms that disclose the implementation of their ERM activities within their 10Ks and 10Qs filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, empirical evidence confirms the above basic argument. The implication of these findings is that firms should consider the implementation of an ERM system in conjunction with contextual variables surrounding the firm. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Management compensation is often categorized as either sensitive or insensitive to firm performance. This one-dimensional treatment ignores the variation in the types and terms of compensation contracts. Through a cross-sectional examination of shareholder-authorized compensation arrangements, this paper demonstrates that the terms of stock option and restricted stock plans, and the flexibility afforded the board of directors in negotiating with managers, vary systematically with the characteristics of the assets being managed. This variation in compensation contracting challenges theorists to incorporate the richness of management contracts into models of incentive pay.},

abstract={This paper extends prior research on the relationship between governance quality and auditor remuneration. We examine the influence of audit committee effectiveness (ACE), a proxy for governance quality, on audit fees (AF) and non-audit services fees (NASF) using a new composite measure comprising audit committee independence, expertise, diligence and size. We find that after controlling for board of director characteristics, there is a significant positive association between ACE and AF only for larger clients. Our results indicate that effective audit committees undertake more monitoring which results in wider audit scope and higher audit fees. Contrary to our expectations, we find the association between ACE and NASF to be positive and significant, especially for larger clients. This suggests that larger clients are more likely to purchase non-audit services (NAS) even in the presence of effective audit committees probably due to the complexity of their activities. Overall, our findings support regulatory initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance quality. ¬© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.},

abstract={We examine the impact of cultural diversity in boards of directors on firm performance. We construct a measure of national cultural diversity by calculating the average of cultural distances between board members using Hofstede's culture framework. Our findings indicate that national cultural diversity in boards negatively affects firm performance measured by Tobin's Q and ROA. These results hold after controlling for potential endogeneity using firm fixed effects and instrumental variables regressions. Further, the results are robust to controlling for a wide range of board and firm characteristics, including various measures of ‚Äúforeignness‚Äù of the firm, alternative culture frameworks, and other measures of culture. The negative impact of cultural diversity on performance is mitigated by the complexity of the firm and the size of foreign sales and operations. In addition, we find that the negative effects of cultural diversity are concentrated among the independent directors. Finally, we find that not all aspects of cultural differences are equally important and that it is mainly the diversity in individualism and masculinity that affects the effectiveness of boards of directors. ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how a risk management committee (RMC), as a newly evolving subÓì∏committee of the board of directors, functions as a key governance support mechanism in the oversight an organisation's risk management strategies, policies and processes. However, empirical evidence on the factors associated with the existence and the type of RMCs remains scant. Design/methodology/approach Using an agency theory perspective, this study investigates the association between board factors such as proportion of nonÓì∏executive directors, Chief Executive Officer duality, and board size; as well as, other firmÓì∏related factors (e.g. auditor type, industry, leverage, and complexity), and the existence of a RMC, and the type of RMC (namely, a separate RMC versus one that is combined with the audit committee). Data was collected from the annual reports of the top 300 Australian Stock Exchange (ASX)Óì∏listed companies. Findings The results, based on logistic regression analyses, indicate that RMCs tend to exist in companies with an independent board chairman and larger boards. Further, the results also indicate that in comparison to companies with a combined RMC and audit committee, those with a separate RMC are more likely to have larger boards, higher financial reporting risk and lower organisational complexity. Research limitations/implications Data limited to top 200 top ASXÓì∏listed companies, thus restricting generalisability of the results. Originality/value The findings of this study provide additional information on the use and design of RMCs in a voluntary setting. ¬© 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Through content analysis, a synthesized list of 13 different roles were identified. The study considered institutional and organizational attributes such as environmental uncertainty and organizational complexity to explore the contingencies under which certain board roles become more prevalent. The roles were also matched to existing governance theories. The list not only reflects activities recognized by different theoretical models but also suggests conflicts in the way strategy is conceptualized and articulated as a governance task. ¬© 2010 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to explore the proposition that diversifying the board in terms of gender, ethnicity or skill base may require consideration of the specific strategic environment of the organisation. The proposition arises from the question as to whether or not greater diversity in board configuration is desirable in certain circumstances and considers the group dynamics, skill mix and capabilities that are required by boards under different conditions of change and strategic complexity. Design/methodology/ approach - The study examines the financial performance of New Zealand publicly listed companies over a five-year period and focuses on changes in board composition, strategic activity and implications for corporate performance. Findings - The study finds limited support for the idea that board configuration, strategic context and corporate decision quality may be linked. Originality/value - This paper will be of particular value to those involved in the appointment of directors within the private and public sectors. In particular, it focuses discussion on the strategic environment faced by the organisation and the relevance of a range of potential selection criteria when appointing new directors. It is also of interest to researchers evaluating the value of social capital and gender equity in contemporary organisations as, based on empirical reseach, it challenges conventional thinking. By implication, the paper also questions whether or not boards are actually able to influence key outcomes in the manner expected by legislators. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite the considerable increase in studies on international joint ventures (IJVs) and family business, the two research streams have yet to be systemically integrated. Family firms have unique characteristics that affect their involvement in IJVs differently from their non-family counterparts. Indeed, family firms face a paradox entailing a lower willingness to form IJVs, but a higher ability to govern them. Drawing on three distinct components of strategic agility (i.e., strategic sensitivity, leadership unity, and resource fluidity), we develop a theoretical framework that unravels this paradox. Specifically, we argue that strong emotional attachment reduces family firms' strategic sensitivity, creating a motivational gap with respect to forming IJVs. On the other hand, when family firms overcome this gap by making full use of their board of directors, they have higher levels of leadership unity and resource fluidity. These dimensions lead to a greater ability to govern the complexities of the relationship, hence reducing opportunistic hazards, and significantly increasing the odds of the long-term success of IJVs. We develop propositions for empirical studies, and offer implications and directions for future research. ¬© 2020},

abstract={Never has voting been more important in corporate law. With greater activism among shareholders and the shift from plurality to majority voting for directors, the number of close votes is rising. But is the basic technology of corporate voting adequate to the task? In this Article, we first examine the incredibly complicated system of U.S. corporate voting, a complexity that is driven by the underlying custodial-ownership structure, by dispersed ownership and large trading volumes, and by the rise in short-selling and derivatives. We identify three ways in which things predictably go wrong: pathologies of complexity; pathologies of ownership; and pathologies of misalignment of interests. We then discuss the current legal treatment of these pathologies and consider a variety of directions for reform, ranging from incremental modifications to fundamental redesign. We show that, absent a fundamental reconstruction of the ownership structure, the existing system will continue to be noisy, imprecise, and disturbingly opaque. The problems with the existing system pose fundamental challenges for both proponents of direct shareholder democracy, who advocate more-extensive voting rights for shareholders, and for proponents of indirect shareholder democracy, who advocate deference to a board of directors, the legitimacy of which ultimately rests on shareholder elections.},

Senouf, 535 A.2d 1351, 1354-55 (Del. 1987), the Delaware Supreme Court reiterated this bright-line view: In making that choice, the burden must be upon the stockholder to obtain the advantages of record ownership. The legal and practical effects of having one's stock registered in street name cannot be visited upon the issuer. The attendant risks are those of the stockholder, and where appropriate, the broker (citing Lewis v. Corroon & Reynolds Corp., 57 A.2d 632, 634 (Del. Ch. 1948); Nickles v. United Nuclear Corp., 192 A.2d 628 (Del. Ch. 1963)). See also Am. Hardware Corp. v. Savage Arms Corp., 136 A.2d 690, 693 (Del. 1957); In re Giant Portland Cement Co., 21 A.2d 697 (Del.

Of the sections referred to, ¬ß 211(e) permits electronic voting, ¬ß 212(c)(2) permits electronic transmission of proxies, and ¬ß 211(a)(2)(b)(i) permits participation by remote communication. These provisions were added in 2000; 67 Del. Laws 810 (1990), cited in Seidman & Assocs., L.L.C. v. G.A. Fin., Inc., 837 A.2d 21, 27 n.14 (Del. Ch. 2003); ¬ß 231(d) (emphasis added). Up until 1990, Delaware took an even narrower view on what materials may be considered. Under the doctrine of Williams v. Sterling Oil of Okla., 273 A.2d 264, 265-66 (Del. 1971), the inspector could not look to any extrinsic evidence at all. In 1989, in Concord Fin. Group v. Tri-State Motor Transit Co. of Del., 567 A.2d 1, 13 (Del. Ch. 1989), the Delaware Chancery Court reaffirmed the Williams court's refusal to consider extrinsic evidence and held that the inspector erred in considering extrinsic evidence of an obvious clerical error to resolve an outcome-determinative overvote. In response, in 1990, the Delaware legislature amended ¬ß 231 to provide the exception discussed in text. See 67 Del. Laws 810 (1990); 837 A.2d 21 (Del.

Article 8: Transfer of securities in the traditional certificate-based system was a complicated, labor-intensive process. Each time securities were traded, the physical certificates had to be delivered from the seller to the buyer, and in the case of registered securities the certificates had to be surrendered to the issuer or its transfer agent for registration of transfer. As is well known, the mechanical problems of processing the paperwork for securities transfers reached crisis proportions in the late 1960s, leading to calls for the elimination of the physical certificate and development of modern electronic systems for recording ownership of securities and transfers of ownership.

Serv, The SEC's final report states: In Section 17A of the Act Congress directed the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

Icahn had a stake of about ten percent in Mylan, both in terms of economic exposure and in terms of voting rights. But Icahn also had shorted 5.3 million shares of King stock. Id. Icahn could thus have an economic interest to oppose the merger, even if the merger were in the interest of Mylan, as long as the market thought that the merger would be significantly more beneficial to King. In that event, Icahn would gain more from a defeat of the merger through his short position in King than he lost on account of his long position in Mylan. For example, suppose Icahn shorted the King shares at $30 per share, so that the shares would go up to $40 per share if the merger was completed but down to $20 per share if the merger failed. Icahn would then profit from defeating the merger if his profits from shorting were greater than the increase in the value of his Mylan stake from approving the; Vote buying traditionally involves an acquisition of votes without an acquisition of an economic stake.

Because securities lending is really a transfer of a security subject to an obligation to retransfer an equivalent security later, the securities loan itself would be recorded on the registry as a transfer with the return similarly recorded, Thus, the system forces an attribution of lent shares to specific accounts, with notice to the account holder, while also ensuring that no more than 100% of the shares appear. Because each securities loan involves an actual recorded transfer of shares on the registry, the cost of securities lending may increase, as intermediaries will not be able to lend securities out of the float, the aggregate of shares which are unlikely to be sold during a given period; U.C.C. art. 8 prefatory note (amended 2003); Delaware, for example, provides: The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.

abstract={This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification. ¬© 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the establishment of a risk management committee and board structures of Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee. These findings suggest that stronger boards demonstrate their commitment to and awareness of improved internal control environment. Finally, the study also documents a positive and significant association between firm size, complexity of a firm's operations, and the use of Big Four audit firms with the establishment of a risk management committee. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract={This study tests whether firms seek to mitigate the adverse effects of Financial Reporting Complexity (FRC) by investing in accounting expertise. We develop a measure of FRC based on the complexity of accounting standards that govern annual disclosures. We find that FRC is positively related to the accounting expertise on a firm's board of directors and audit committee. We also find that accounting expertise mitigates the relation between FRC and negative reporting outcomes. Collectively, this study increases our understanding of the actions firms take to mitigate the negative consequences of FRC, and the role of accounting expertise in this setting. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature about the link between board characteristics and the level of social responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008‚Äì2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

abstract={Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries‚Äîoften labeled ‚Äúlack of transparency‚Äù‚Äîbetween top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high. ¬© 2013, ¬© The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Collectively, current resource-development literature has given little attention to organizational features of ownership as important variables in community resilience. By drawing from six local buyout cases in Canada's forest sector, we reveal the complexity and numerous constraints on local ownership and expose a more nuanced context than most sociologists tend to consider. Our findings suggest that the meaning of local ownership and community resilience varies depending upon the composition (e.g., private vs. public; mill vs. forest license vs. coupled mill & forest license), type (social, cooperative, trust and/or direct-share ownership), extent of ownership (percentage of local versus extra-local shares), and the level of control (e.g., proportion of locally held seats on the Board of Directors) associated with ownership. Future research on local ownership should more carefully differentiate between the nature of local ownership and its associated outcomes. Copyright ¬© 2006 by the Rural Sociological Society.},

abstract={Recently, many empirical studies have examined the determinants of corporate boards of directors. Using an agency theory framework, the authors explain how nonprofit boards are structured. Although nonprofits cannot disburse profits to their contributors, the role played by their boards of trustees in monitoring and advising managers is analogous to that of corporate boards of directors. Using a sample of Spanish foundations, the authors show that nonprofit board determinants, such as organizational complexity and financing structure, are similar in many ways to those of corporate boards. However, nonprofit age illustrates the different natures of these organizations and their voluntary boards. ¬© 2009 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={In recent years a growing interest in gender diversity has arisen in the business context, and a significant number of research studies have analysed its effect on corporate performance. Nonetheless, these studies have not led to conclusive results, perhaps owing to the complexity of the relationship. The present work focuses on analysing two possible justifications of the contradictory effects of gender diversity on company performance: the business context and the optimum size of the female presence in decision-making bodies. The results obtained show that when working conditions and academic background are similar, women achieve better performance in sectors traditionally dominated by men. Moreover, to take the best advantage of gender diversity it is recommended that boards of directors should be balanced or have a slightly higher female presence. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

abstract={The board of directors is a flat governance structure where each director has an equal vote in determining the collective actions taken by the group. Yet, some boards choose to delegate authority for specific tasks to numerous committees, while others choose to create relatively few subcommittees of the board. We investigate the determinants of subordinate board structures, exploring both their benefits and costs. Using a sample of the S&P 1500 we find that subordinate board structures are positively related to board size and the proportion of outside directors, even after controlling firm characteristics such as complexity and ownership structure. Further tests indicate that these board structures can offset the negative associations that board size and the proportion of outsiders can have with firm performance. Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, where co-ordination problems among directors or social loafing may be less pronounced, we find that subordinate board structures are negatively related to firm performance. Categorizing committees as either monitoring or advisory, we find that both types of committees appear related to firm performance. Taken as whole, these results are consistent with the idea that subordinate board structures can be a costly remedy to alleviate problems that arise with larger, more outsider dominated boards. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Drawing on the complexity theory and responding to the recent calls to use such creative methods that mix between a quantitative and qualitative approach. Therefore, this study fills the literature gap, adding novelties, showing evidence from the unexplored (or underexplored) European context and, consequently, shedding light to inconclusive results in previous research concerning the effect of audit committee (AC) and board characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure by applying a novel research methodology: the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. The data were collected from Eikon database for a sample of the top 69 non-financial European companies (based on market capitalisation) for the period 2016‚Äì2018. The study results support the equifinality and complexity tenets of complexity theory. It also suggests that CSR disclosure relies on a complex configuration of some AC attributes, for example, independence, financial expert member, chair independence, size and activity, and other board characteristics (independence, gender, size, activity, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality). These characteristics play a leading part as a recipe ingredient and, in an appropriate combination, promote achieving high CSR disclosure levels. Our empirical results offer multidimensional and valuable insights for professionals, regulators, and policymakers in establishing and revising the guidelines regarding the AC and board of directors' composition. ¬© 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. ¬© 2020 Academy of Management Review.},

abstract={Background: Despite pressures to change the role of hospital boards, hospitals have made few changes in board composition or director selection criteria. Hospital boards have often continued to operate in their traditional roles as either "monitors" or "advisors." More attention to the direct involvement of hospital boards in the strategic decision-making process of the organizations they serve, the timing and circumstances under which board involvement occurs, and the board composition that enhances their abilities to participate fully is needed. Purposes: We investigated the relationship between broader expertise among hospital board members, board involvement in the stages of strategic decision making, and the hospital's strategic focus. Methodology/Approach: We surveyed top management team members of 72 nonacademic hospitals to explore the participation of critical stakeholder groups such as the board of directors in the strategic decision-making process. We used hierarchical regression analysis to explore our hypotheses that there is a relationship between both the nature and involvement of the board and the hospital's strategic orientation. Findings: Hospitals with broader expertise on their boards reported an external focus. For some of their externally-oriented goals, hospitals also reported that their boards were involved earlier in the stages of decision making. Practice Implications: In light of the complex and dynamic environment of hospitals today, those charged with developing hospital boards should match the variety in the external issues that the hospital faces with more variety in board makeup. By developing a board with greater breadth of expertise, the hospital responds to its complex environment by absorbing that complexity, enabling a greater potential for sensemaking and learning. Rather than acting only as monitors and advisors, boards impact their hospitals' strategic focus through their participation in the strategic decision-making process.

abstract={Purpose ‚Äì The purpose of this paper is to review and critique prior research on audit committees using a practice-theory lens. Research on audit committees has followed the same trajectory as early research on boards of directors, which has been criticised for its singular theoretical perspectives and methodologies that do not capture the complexity of real-world experiences/behaviours. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì The authors devise an analytical framework based on practice theory to conduct the review. The authors examine what audit committees should do (i.e. best practice) vs what audit committees actually do (i.e. actual activities in practice ‚Äì praxis). Attributes of audit committee members, and the relationship dynamics relevant to their role execution (i.e. practitioners), are considered. Findings ‚Äì Research on boards has found that over-emphasis on agency theory‚Äôs monitoring role negatively impacts boards‚Äô effectiveness. The authors invoke other theories in examining what audit committees do in practice. The authors characterise the role of audit committees as oversight not monitoring. The authors question whether, similar to auditing, audit committees are blamist tools or are genuinely orientated towards supporting improvements in organisational management systems. The authors unpack the ritualistic ceremonial behaviours and symbolic endeavours vs substantive engagement by audit committees. The analytical framework also considers the ‚Äúguardianship circle‚Äù around audit committees in the form of the key practitioners and their relationships: audit committee members, auditors and managers. Originality/value ‚Äì Drawing on the analytical framework, the authors provide directions for further opportunities for research of audit committees. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate two research questions. Is internal control system (ICS) disclosure, as a monitoring mechanism, associated with the characteristics of the board of directors, particularly the audit committee as the main board committee devoted to the effectiveness of ICS? Does the regulatory environment, particularly the regulation on ICS disclosure as an external governance/monitoring mechanism play a role in shaping the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure and, if so, how? Design/methodology/approach - The authors study the ICS disclosure of 149 companies listed in four European financial markets (London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan), each with its own regulations about ICS disclosure, during a six-year period (2003-2008). Findings - The findings support an inverse association between the extent of ICS disclosure and the proxies for board monitoring. The authors also find a statistically significant negative relationship between board monitoring and substantial ICS disclosure but no relationship between board monitoring and formal ICS disclosure. The evidence also shows that the regulatory environment moderates the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure by introducing trade-offs among monitoring mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - An important caveat of the research is that it does not explore if and how investors use ICS disclosure to evaluate the firm. Practical implications - The authors propose a framework for the analysis of ICS disclosure that overcomes limitations of previous literature that has neglected the importance of the content beyond the extent of ICS disclosure. Through this framework researchers, practitioners and standard setters are able to separate merely descriptive, formal un-useful disclosure (boilerplate information) on the composing elements of the ICS from substantial disclosure regarding the functioning of the ICS (monitoring function). Originality/value - The authors also provide evidence that the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure varies with the content of the information communicated, thus offering guidance for future research not to focus on measuring the extent or quantity of disclosure but on the variety and complexity of the information communicated. ¬© 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study seeks to explore how non-executive directors address governance problems on Dutch two-tier boards. Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address due to the formal separation of management boards' decision-management from supervisory boards' decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of two-tier boards in The Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and the management of the relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom. Originality/value: Whereas most studies have focussed on regulatory initiatives to improve the functioning of boards (e.g. the independence of the board), this study explores how non-executive directors attempt to enhance the effectiveness of boards on which they serve. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

abstract={This study examined the implementation of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) on firm performance of Public Listed Companies (PLCs) on main market in Bursa Malaysia based on COSO (2004) ERM Integrated Framework. In addition, this study also investigated the moderating role of Board of Directors‚Äô (BODs) monitoring, firm complexity and firm size of the implementation of ERM on firm performance. Questionnaire survey was adopted as the research methodology for this study. Total of 103 questionnaires were successfully collected through mail questionnaire from PLCs. The data was analyzed by using Partial Least Squares and Structural Equation Modeling Tool (Smart-PLS 2.0 M3). Based on the analysis, implementation of ERM was found to have significant influence on firm performance. In addition, monitoring by BODs, firm size and firm complexity were found to significantly influence the relationship between ERM implementation to firm performance. The findings from this study enable organizations to better understand the status of their ERM implementation and assist them in identifying areas of improvement with regards to the processes within each ERM elements. It also contributes to the literature on the importance of good governance within ERM framework in organizations. ¬© 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The primary objectives of this paper are to: develop a multi-attribute pattern of the corporate governance model in Thai state-owned enterprises; assess the relative importance of different corporate governance practices; and provide detailed information of each corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used. A case study was conducted to gather information on specific corporate governance behaviors in Thai state-owned enterprises. Then a questionnaire was developed and tested in 38 Thai state-owned enterprises. Factor analysis was conducted to examine a common framework of corporate governance practices. Findings: This research demonstrated the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in Thai state-owned enterprises. According to this model, the most important corporate governance practice is strategic human resource management, followed by information technology, board of directors, risk management, internal control, and internal audit sequentially. Additionally, this study brings out insights into corporate governance practices that represent the specific characteristics of Thai state-owned enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by the fact that the sample represents only Thai state-owned enterprises. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the complexity of the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in state-owned enterprises in developing countries. Practical implications: Policy makers can utilize the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model as a guideline for the further development of corporate governance practices in other state-owned enterprises. Originality/value: This study demonstrated the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in state-owned enterprises in developing countries such as Thailand. This research confirms the broad principles of corporate governance as well as providing detailed information on corporate governance practices from a new perspective. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001‚Äì2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The 2015-2017 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Special Taskforce on Diversifying our Investment in Human Capital was appointed for a two-year term, due to the rigors and complexities of its charges. This report serves as a white paper for academic pharmacy on diversifying our investment in human capital. The Taskforce developed and recommended a representation statement that was adapted and adopted by the AACP House of Delegates at the 2016 AACP Annual Meeting. In addition, the Taskforce developed a diversity statement for the Association that was adopted by the AACP Board of Directors in 2017. The Taskforce also provides recommendations to AACP and to academic pharmacy in this white paper. ¬© 2017, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In a cross-country setting, we document that busy boards of directors (i.e., outside directors with multiple directorships) enhance a bank's financing capacity by lowering its cost of debt, which is consistent with the signalling quality hypothesis. Our analysis further reveals that this negative association is more pronounced in conventional banks than their Islamic counterparts. Possibly owning to the distinctive governance structure and the complexity of the Islamic business model, which requires closer monitoring, Muslim debtholders might depreciate a busy board of directors as it is likely to associate with lower scrutinising effectiveness. Our results provide a positive counterpoint to the negative relationship that exists between busy directors and firm performance, and contributes to understanding the indispensable role busy boards play in debt financing. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We investigate the extent to which the incentive alignment theory and the managerial power theory explain the variability of CFO compensation in Australia. We find a positive relationship between the level of CFO compensation and measures of job complexity and firm stock market performance. However, we do not find the pay-for-performance link when performance is measured at the CFO-specific level. CFOs actually receive higher non-cash compensation when reporting quality is lower, suggesting a sharp contrast to predictions of the incentive alignment approach. Conversely, we find that CFOs who have more managerial power (the CFO is on the board of directors, or holds a higher level of stock ownership, or stays longer in their position) receive significantly higher compensation. For example, a CFO who has board membership receives on average $323,590 more than the total compensation of a CFO who is not a board insider. Overall both theories are important in determining Australian CFO compensation but the managerial power hypothesis explains a larger fraction of variation in CFO pay than the incentive alignment view. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose ‚Äì The purpose of this paper is to unravel the root causes as to why the boardroom independence‚Äìcorporate performance linkage remains an elusive conundrum in the academic literature, and to propose practical recommendations for future research endeavors. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì The probing of the underlying issues is made via an extensive review of the existing literature. A thoughtful analysis is conducted from a multi-disciplinary perspective by soliciting feedback from academics with corporate governance expertise in finance, accounting, economy, strategy, management and organizational behavior. Findings ‚Äì The lack of consensus on the economic value of an independent boardroom is attributed to three reasons. The first reason is ontological complexities inherent to the very nature of the corporation. The second reason is methodological complexities intrinsic to normative research with large archival data. The third reason is self-serving behavioral motive that cannot be factored in archival data. Research limitations/implications ‚Äì The infusion of complementary methodologies to the existing empirical dogmatism would provide the framework for a better understanding of corporate governance challenges and opportunities, particularly as it relates to making causal inferences on boardroom independence and corporate performance. Practical implications ‚Äì New insights on boardroom independence would directly influence corporate practices. Social implications ‚Äì The determination as to what constitutes optimum boardroom configuration has emerged as an issue of considerable importance to shareholders, policymakers and other stakeholders. Originality/value ‚Äì Virtually no studies have been conducted in a comprehensive and systematic manner addressing the fundamental question as to why research pertaining to boardroom independence‚Äìcorporate performance has not yielded unequivocal results in the relevant academic literature, thus the originality and value of this research. ¬© 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Skilled labour has gained significance as a production factor in the age of information technology, but accounting does not recognize human capital as an asset that contributes to the firm's earning power. This paper suggests a method to develop a latent index to proxy the managerial-skill component of human capital. The proposed index depends on the empirical validity of self-sorting theories for managerial tasks and the choice of the type of at-risk (i.e. outcome-contingent) compensation contract. The empirical analysis uses data on compensation of executive members of the board of directors, their personal attributes (experience, risk aversion and wealth), firm-specific variables (profitability growth rates, organizational complexity and operating risk), and type of industry. The extent to which equity markets value the predicted labour skills shows that investors in the marketplace recognize human capital even though accounting does not. The valuation coefficient on the variable imputed for human capital is significant for all years examined. This study contributes to the literature by showing that relative incentive compensation (incentive pay per dollar of fixed salary) is a viable surrogate for human capital defined as the skills embodied in people. ¬© 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper analyses board size and composition determinants with reference to boards' two principal functions: the control or monitoring function and the advisory function. It also tackles the endogeneity problem which exists in this type of studies. Using a sample composed of 171 publically traded Spanish corporations spanning the period 2004-2008, the results show that, in Spain, board size is sensitive to advisory needs (using firm complexity as a proxy for them), while board composition depends to a greater extent on the need for control, determined by the organization's stock structure. The evidence shows that the presence of independent members on the boards of directors in Spain basically responds the objective of guaranteeing an adequate representation of the ownership structure of the company rather than in response to a specific need for counselling. ¬© 2001 Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Contabilidad y Administraci√≥n de Empresas.},

abstract={In 2004, Spain's Banco Santander purchased Britain's Abbey National Bank in a deal valued at fifteen billion dollars--an acquisition that made Santander one of the ten largest financial institutions in the world. Here, Mauro Guill√©n and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents.Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guill√©n and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking.Building a Global Banktells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it. ¬© 2008 by Princeton University Press.

abstract={At the close of the twentieth century, U.S. corporate scholarship was dominated by a principal-agent paradigm that assumed that shareholders were the principals or sole residual claimants in public corporations, and also assumed that corporate directors were the shareholders' agents. This approach led many corporate scholars to assume that the proper purpose of the corporation was to maximize shareholder wealth and that the chief economic problem of interest in corporate law was the "agency cost" problem of getting corporate directors to focus on this goal. There are basic aspects of U.S. corporate law, however, that the principal-agent model cannot explain. These include directors' extensive and sui generis legal powers; the fact that directors control dividends; the device of legal personality; and the open-ended rules of corporate purpose. These corporate law "anomalies" have prompted contemporary economic and legal scholars to begin to move beyond a focus on agency costs and to pay attention to a second economic problem that arises in public corporations: the problem of protecting specific investment. When corporate production requires more than one individual or group to make specific investments, problems of intrafirm opportunism arise if shareholders try to exploit each other's specific investments or try to exploit the specific investments of creditors, employees, customers, and other groups. Board governance, while worsening agency costs, may provide a second-best solution to such intrafirm rent-seeking. This perspective explains many important corporate law "anomalies" that cannot be explained by the principal-agent model. It also suggests a pressing need to revisit conventional notions of corporate purpose. Focusing on the problem of specific investment suggests that the proper purpose of the public corporation is not maximizing shareholder wealth, but promoting long-term, value-creating economic production under conditions of complexity and uncertainty, in a fashion that provides surplus benefits not only to shareholders but to other groups that make specific investments in corporations as well. This corporate objective is difficult to measure, much less maximize. Nevertheless, it may provide a better gauge of good corporate governance than the simplistic rubric of shareholder wealth. ¬© 2006 T.M.C. Asser Press.},

abstract={Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

abstract={Increasing amount of data the organizations worldwide have at their disposal lead to the need to structure, organize and present the information obtained from it. That is because, in¬†today‚Äôs rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard‚Äôs goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard‚Äôs goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design. ¬© 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={In the growing debate about designing new management control systems (MCS) to include stakeholder values, there has been little discussion about information overload. Stakeholder advocates call for including more environmental and related social disclosures but do not consider how information overload might impair the use and interpretation of corporate performance measures. As we know, shareholders and boards of directors are most concerned with market data such as earnings per share, dividend rates, and market value growth. In this chapter, we assert that management control system designers must consider information overload before expanding the MCS to include social and nonfinancial disclosures. The paradox in expanding MCS is that demand for sustainability performance measures will likely result in overload for both information preparers and information users. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and similar sustainability disclosures are likely to overload MCS and overwhelm the readers and users by performance reports that include multiple dimensions. CSR affects the design of companies' annual reports because stakeholders are increasingly concerned with how organizations address their social responsibilities and how they disclose their societal responses. Management accountants are accustomed to providing performance measures within an organization and MCS usually have an internal focus. CFOs are often not accustomed to balancing the needs of stakeholders with those of managers and owners. We suggest that companies and CFOs will face an information overload dilemma in making these determinations, and that users will be overloaded in sifting through the multiple dimensions of information that are increasingly being provided. We suggest that the bias toward financial performance measures will distort both the provision of relevant information and the use of sustainability performance measures. We modified the Epstein and Roy sustainability model (2001) to illustrate some of these potential impacts. We note that the balanced scorecard (BSC) was developed as one such tool to reflect and communicate multiple measures. We summarize a previous study showing how managers ignored multiple performance measures in a performance scorecard study. We then relate our results to some of the information overload literature to support our suggestion that stakeholders will face many of the same information overload issues and constraints when using and processing social disclosures. Our summary of the information overload literature results in a call for more interdisciplinary information overload research involving real-world contexts and tasks. We note that most of the extant information overload literature is restricted to discipline-based silo-oriented studies and to simplistic evaluations, brand identification, or forecasting tasks. Our study went into some depth to describe the business, its strategies and objectives, and a comparison of actual results to specific goals. As management control systems evolve or are designed to report sustainability data, the issues surrounding increasing complexity and information overload will become exponentially problematic. We suggest that future research also include consideration of information overload conditions facing preparers and disclosers of sustainability measures.

abstract={Risk management is an important function to the service business that continues to grow in breadth and complexity. It involves the systematic application of a five-step process which is designed to enable a risk manager to cope with the risks of pure loss exposures. A number of operational and financing techniques can be employed to treat risks of loss once they have been identified. The particular technique(s) chosen by a service firm depends to a significant degree upon the firm‚Äôs objectives in relation to each of six performance dimensions. While the concept of risk management follows a patterned thought process and can be readily understood, it is helpful to select risk management techniques on the basis of relatively sophisticated decision theory formulations. Assistance in identifying, analysing, and treating loss exposures may be sought from outside experts. Too often, top management and boards of directors do not realise the value and necessity of an effective risk management programme in minimising the adverse impact of risk on the service firm's resources and earnings. A sound risk management programme enables a service business to minimise expenses, operate more effectively, and achieve some combination of pre-loss and post-loss objectives. Such a programme can make it possible for the service firm to survive an otherwise crippling financial loss and sustain service continuity. Sound risk management also engenders peace of mind and confidence while enabling owners to concentrate more of their attention on speculative risks which they might otherwise seek to avoid. For these reasons, it is increasingly crucial that service firm managers learn to manage pure risks effectively. ¬© 1991, MCB},

abstract={This paper provides a review of research on financial derivatives, with an emphasis on and comprehensive coverage of research published in 15 top accounting journals from 1996 to 2017. We begin with some brief institutional details about derivatives and then summarize studies explaining when and why firms use derivatives. We then discuss the evolution of the accounting rules related to derivatives (and associated disclosure requirements) and studies that examine changes in these requirements over the years. Next, we review the literature that examines the consequences of firms‚Äô derivative use to various capital market participants (i.e., managers, analysts, investors, boards of directors, etc.), with an emphasis on the role that the accounting and disclosure rules play in such consequences. Finally, we discuss the importance of industry affiliation on firms‚Äô derivative use and the role that industry affiliation plays in derivatives research. Overall, our review suggests that, perhaps due to their inherent complexity and data limitations, derivatives are relatively understudied in accounting, and we highlight several areas where future research is needed. ¬© 2019 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting},

abstract={Purpose ‚Äì To: evaluate Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory as functional models of decision making and risk within various contexts; compare and analyze risk models and decision-making models; evaluate models of stock risk developed by Robert Engle and related models; establish whether the models are related and have the same foundations; relate risk, decision making and options theory; and develop the foundations for a new model of decision making and risk named ‚Äúbelief systems‚Äù. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì Critiques existing academic work in different contexts. Analyzes the shortcomings of various measures of risk, and group decision making, which was not addressed in developing Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory. Develops the characteristics of a mew model for decision making and risk named ‚Äúbelief systems‚Äù, and then differentiates it from belief networks. Findings ‚Äì Decision making is a multi-factor, multi-dimensional process that often requires the processing of information, and thus, it is inaccurate to impose rigid models in decision making; the existing metrics for quantifying risk are inadequate; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory were developed using questionable methods and data, and are impractical; the analysis of probabilistic insurance and most of the theories and ‚Äúeffects‚Äù developed by Kahneman and Tversky's articles are invalid and impractical; Prospect Theory, Cumulative Prospect Theory, Expected Utility Theory, and market-risk models are conceptually the same and do not account for many facets of risk and decision making; risk and decision making are better quantified and modeled using a mix of situation-specific dynamic, quantitative and qualitative factors; belief systems can better account for the multi-dimensional characteristics of risk and decision making. Research limitations/implications ‚Äì Areas for further research include: development of dynamic market-risk models that incorporate asset-market psychology, liquidity, market size, frequency of trading, knowledge differences among market participants, and trading rules in each market; and further development of concepts in belief systems. Practical implications ‚Äì Decision making and risk assessment are multi-criteria processes that typically require some processing of information, and thus cannot be defined accurately by rigid quantitative models; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory are abstract, rigid, and are not practical models for decision making; and existing market-risk models are inaccurate, and thus the international financial system may be compromised. Originality/value ‚Äì The issues discussed are relevant to government regulators, central banks, judges, risk managers, executives, derivatives regulators, stock exchange regulators, legislators, psychologists, boards of directors, finance professionals, management science/operations research professionals, health-care-informatics professionals, scientists, engineers, and people in any situation that requires decision making and risk assessment. ¬© 2005, ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose ‚Äì To: evaluate Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory as functional models of decision making and risk within various contexts; compare and analyze risk models and decision-making models; evaluate models of stock risk developed by Robert Engle and related models; establish whether the models are related and have the same foundations; relate risk, decision making and options theory; and develop the foundations for a new model of decision making and risk named ‚Äúbelief systems‚Äù. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì Critiques existing academic work in different contexts. Analyzes the shortcomings of various measures of risk, and group decision making, which was not addressed in developing Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory. Develops the characteristics of a mew model for decision making and risk named ‚Äúbelief systems‚Äù, and then differentiates it from belief networks. Findings ‚Äì Decision making is a multi-factor, multi-dimensional process that often requires the processing of information, and thus, it is inaccurate to impose rigid models in decision making; the existing metrics for quantifying risk are inadequate; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory were developed using questionable methods and data, and are impractical; the analysis of probabilistic insurance and most of the theories and ‚Äúeffects‚Äù developed by Kahneman and Tversky's articles are invalid and impractical; Prospect Theory, Cumulative Prospect Theory, Expected Utility Theory, and market-risk models are conceptually the same and do not account for many facets of risk and decision making; risk and decision making are better quantified and modeled using a mix of situation-specific dynamic, quantitative and qualitative factors; belief systems can better account for the multi-dimensional characteristics of risk and decision making.

abstract={The current U.S. climate of racial and social injustice has prompted a renewed call for diverse and equitable ways to rethink community philanthropy. Community foundations are vehicles for community philanthropy which offer vast benefits for social improvement and community development. The board of directors ensures these organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs of certain social groups. Increased understanding of diversity can improve foundation and philanthropic effectiveness and bring broader social change by promoting equity and social justice among community-based philanthropic organizations. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Questions on the use of current theories of governance for co-operative businesses are prevalent within the literature. This paper seeks to determine if the theory of cyclical board behavior can provide insight into the evolution of co-operative boards within food co-operatives in Ontario, Canada. To answer these questions managers from food co-operatives participated in a one-hour long, semi-structured interview providing their understanding of the governance within their co-operatives. Managers identified board member engagement, the changing role of the board and succession planning as issues of concern. Engagement level of board members varied from a lack of participation to overbearing participation, which caused tensions within the co-operative. Current governance theories do not appear to adequately explain governance within a co-operative structure. A single, universal governance framework does not address the complexities of a member owned firm. The cyclical board behavior, however, does provide insight into co-operative board evolution. ¬© 2016 The AuthorsAnnals of Public and Cooperative Economics ¬© 2016 CIRIEC},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the outlook for risk management and enterprise risk management (ERM) within the hospitality sector including how ERM is being balanced with the need to innovate, and what boards of directors are doing to become more engaged in risk oversight. The implementation of ERM is about taking a strategic view of risk and linking it to business goals and value creation. Design/methodology/approach: An interviewer-administered survey was used to collect data from 33 senior risk professionals and other industry experts who had a clear understanding of both risk management and ERM. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire consisting of three sections was personally administered to 33 respondents in 2018 to collect information from risk professionals and other industry experts. Findings: It is important to create a culture of risk awareness and to incorporate risk planning into business decisions. The complexity of modern business necessitates that managers in the hospitality sector have greater skill levels than ever before. This research should help hospitality managers to better understand the core risks and link them to strategy. ERM creates an environment where the organization as a whole can support the value creation process with a sharper focus on risk management. Practical implications: The growing role of technology along with human connections is shaping the hospitality sector and redefining the travel ecosystem. Future travel experiences are likely to be influenced by a blend of technology and human experiences. Many Indian companies are applying the traditional risk management model in their businesses, while ERM is their future goal. The evolution from a traditional risk management model to ERM is challenging, and so it is important to have an appropriate framework in place for its implementation. Originality/value: Hospitality managers need to know how to proactively manage risk management and ERM as the sector is increasingly vulnerable to internal risks. ERM creates a direct linkage between risks and opportunities required for decision-making in a dynamic environment. With growing competition on a global level, the hospitality industry should aim to manage risks strategically to increase the likelihood that organizational objectives can be achieved. ¬© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this essay my goal is to explore why, despite the tireless e orts of talented people, research on corporate governance has been slow and uneven, and where that research should turn to next to be most valuable to practitioners. My belief is that the most fruitful work thus far has recognized that corporate boards are dynamic social systems, has identified all the forces that shape those systems, and has acknowledged that boards should seek to represent a wide variety of stakeholders, not just shareholders. The best way for me to establish this argument is to trace the history of research on corporate boards and analyze the trends in that research, including the relative value of the types of data that researchers in this field have used. Ultimately, I identify what I consider to be the best path forward in studying these complex social systems. I have made a deliberate choice to focus primarily on research that reflects firsthand experience with boards rather than on research that utilizes data derived from questionnaires and other secondary sources. Not everyone will agree with my choices, but my hope is that my perspective will nonetheless provide some guidance for people working in this evolving field to understand the true complexity of corporate boards. ¬© 2017 Now Publishers Inc.

abstract={This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

abstract={Concern for board of directors considerably increased with the recent developments in the corporate governance field. Despite that extensive research was conducted, the understanding of the board and its effects is still limited. This is mainly because that the majority of the corporate governance research focused mostly on the direct relation of board characteristics with organizational outcomes, and neglected the effect of intervening variables, leading to inconclusive research findings. Deriving on this limitation, in this study, the effect of board composition on organizational performance was investigated for different environmental conditions, which are measured in terms of munificence and dynamism of the industry in which the organizations operate and product complexity of the organizations. In addition, the moderating effects of these dimensions of organizational task environments on the relationship between board composition and organizational performance were also addressed. Building on resource dependence theory, it is suggested that under different environmental conditions, different compositions of boards will positively influence organizational performance. Based on the data from 80 companies which shares are publicly traded in Istanbul Stock Exchange, the findings indicate that the effect of board composition on organizational performance vary among different environmental conditions. ¬© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Despite attempts by the state legislature to fashion the charter of the Pennsylvania Railroad in such a way as to insure a high degree of managerial accountability to the board of directors and to make the corporation broadly accountable to the public, things turned out very differently. The volume and complexity of managerial decisions quickly brought a centralization of power in the hands of the road's professional managers as the board atrophied, and the economic and political power of the road and its dominant figures (J. Edgar Thomson and Thomas A. Scott) negated much of the principle of public accountability. ¬© 1975, The President and Fellows of Harvard College. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study aims to examine (1) the association between the chief executive officer tenure and audit quality, (2) the relationship between chief executive officer duality and audit quality, (3) the association between board independence and audit quality, (4) the relationship between board size and audit quality, and (5) the role of controlling variables (client size, leverage debt, and business complexity) in controlling these relationships. The research sample includes 325 financial reports from manufacturing firms listed in Amman Stock exchange over the 2014-2018 period. The study relationships are tested by using logistic regression. The results revealed a negative relationship, but not significant between CEO tenure and independent directors with audit quality. In addition, the results showed there is a negative effect of CEO duality on audit quality; also the results revealed that there is a statistically significant effect on the board of directors (board size) on the AQ. In general, the coefficient estimates of controlling variables show that client size and leverage debt positively affect audit quality, and on the contrary, business complexity has an insignificant positive relationship with audit quality. The summary of the study findings play an active role to external auditor opinion on business practice in towered the corporate governance system. ¬© Copyright: The Author(s)},

abstract={Purpose: The emergence of Governance practices in the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector has become associated with increasingly high levels of organisational complexity. In the light of an expanding civil society sector in Chile and the emergence of formalised governance practices, this paper explores the construction of the Executive Director role in Chilean NGOs with reference to organisational functions, organisational dynamics, and external influences. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded theory is used to explore qualitative data derived from a set of N¬†=¬†39 interviews conducted in Chile These interviews involve NGO founders, funders, Executive Directors, scholars, consultants, and team members. Findings: The findings reveal the pivotal role played by Executive Directors in conducting organisational activities which, in other types of organisations, are often distributed across various organisational functions. The data also highlight complex dynamics involving overt compliance with external regulatory requirements, uncertainties about financial sustainability, the recruitment of Executive Board members, the exercise of power by Executive Directors, and the influence of founders in leadership configurations. Research limitations/implications: The implications of the study are discussed in relation to the governance and accountability of NGOs, the nature of the Executive Director role, the purpose of Executive Boards in the NGO sector, and the recruitment and training of Board members. It is noted that the study was conducted in the NGO sector in Chile; further research is necessary to establish the generalisability of the findings to other contexts. Originality/value: This paper addresses the shortage of organisational research on NGOs. It contributes by offering analytical perspectives on organisational processes of Leadership and Governance. This paper highlights the relationship between, and interdependency of, those processes. ¬© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and ‚Äòincreased career risks‚Äô perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country‚Äôs culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources. ¬© 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The historical evolution of corporate governance is considered, highlighting the different eras of governance, the dominant theoretical and practical paradigms, the reformulation of paradigms and counter paradigms. Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are explored. Finally, the imperative of the advance of sustainable enterprise is argued, and the critical changes necessitated in corporate purpose and directors' duties.

abstract={Economic theory that suggests underperforming boards of directors should be fearful of an ouster vote by shareholders underappreciates the complexity of shareholder voting decisions. Skill at enhancing firm value has less to do with whether directors win votes and stay at the helm of public companies than previous commentators have presumed. Instead, like incumbent politicians, managers of some of the largest U.S. firms tend to stay in charge of firms because they understand-and take advantage of-the political dynamics of corporate voting. This Article presents a competing theory of shareholder voting decisions, one that suggests that shareholder voting in corporate elections is not dissimilar from citizen voting in political elections. Next, the Article presents the evidence. Using a hand-collected dataset from recent board elections, the Article compares the explanatory power of a standard economic variable (long-term stock price returns) and a political variable (money budgeted for campaigning) on election outcomes. Based on the data, directors' ability to enhance firm value (as measured by stock price returns) is not significantly related to whether they win reelection. Rather, the likelihood of being returned to office appears to be a function of typical election politics-how much was spent by challengers to persuade shareholder voters. These findings have at least two implications. First, the theory that shareholder voting may be politicized helps point the way to how the SEC ought to craft reforms-and, just as important, how not to craft them. Recent SEC reform efforts have the laudable goals of creating new conduits for shareholders to participate in firm affairs, increasing shareholder-nominated candidate success, and disciplining incumbent managers. The results of this study suggest that these reforms will not achieve the stated goals. Even with these reforms, the board continues to have an important political advantage, which likely translates into real votes. As the research here shows, the outcome of elections depends on persuasion and, not simply, as the SEC contends, on shareholders' director nominees being presented alongside those of management. Second, the evidence and theory about shareholder voting presented here has significant implications for understanding mergers and acquisitions, particularly hostile acquisitions. The theory is that acquirers have steep incentives to target firms with poor performance. In most cases, however, such acquisitions depend on winning a vote from shareholders. Thus, if there is any disciplinary effect created by the prospect of takeovers, it depends crucially on understanding what motivates shareholder voting behavior. If voting shareholders respond to political motivations, not economic ones, then the performance of target board members might not be as relevant as takeover theorists had previously surmised. ¬© 2011 by Lee Harris.},

abstract={The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. ¬© Baker College 2011.},

abstract={Purpose: Real-options have moved from being an academic theory to a decision-making tool that is being used by managers. The thinking underpinning real options has remained true to its financial options-pricing heritage, which means that it is based on an assumption of managerial risk-neutrality. Managers can be risk-seeking or risk-averse, depending on whether or not they are meeting performance targets. This paper aims to explore the questions of what happens when the assumption of risk neutrality is relaxed and how the outcomes of managerial decisions on investments affect the firm's stockholders and bondholders. Design/methodology/approach: The work is conceptual in its approach. Findings: Managers, stockholders, or bondholders do not lose when managers are performing above target and when environmental uncertainty is high, or below target when environmental uncertainty is low, but managers win at the expense of stockholders when they are meeting performance targets and uncertainty is low, and managers win at the expense of bondholders when they are performing below target and uncertainty is high. Research limitations/implications: Propositions are provided for subsequent empirical testing. The paper holds environmental complexity and munificence constant, but discusses the implication of that in the conclusions. Practical implications: The research has implications for shareholders and bondholders. It also has implications for Boards of Directors and the actions they take within their monitoring and control duties. Originality/value: Because the paper is able to separate the constructs of uncertainty and risk, this is the first work that has been able to fully relax the assumption of risk neutrality that underpins real-options theory. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Drawing on the notion of ‚Äúfaultlines‚Äù and the upper echelons perspective, we argue that the gender faultline strength of a board of directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly, while gender faultline strength negatively relates to strategic change under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for the hypotheses. ¬© The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm‚Äôs competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the ‚ÄúAwareness-Motivation-Capability‚Äù (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm‚Äôs competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm‚Äôs competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. ¬© The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={BHP plans to enter the bulk fertilizer market by developing its first potash operation, the Jansen Potash Mine, in Saskatchewan, Canada. In conjunction with Amec Foster Wheeler, the Jansen project team developed a model of the Jansen production and logistics chain to understand the drivers of production capacity. The Detailed Integrated Capacity Estimate model (DICE) is a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model of Jansen's upstream production (mining, hoisting, and ore processing) and downstream logistics (rail, port, and marketing). DICE provides an unprecedented combination of complexity, granularity, and scalability, which informs ore storage capacities, product sizing infrastructure, critical-equipment redundancies, bypasses, and operational practices. The team used DICE during the prefeasibility study of the Jansen project. The model provided the justification for the removal of about $300 million in capital expenses to equip the second of two hoisting shafts, the reduction of planned maintenance, and the increase of the degree of mining automation. Throughout the prefeasibility study, Jansen's annual production in stage 1 of operations was estimated to increase by 15-20 percent, with two-thirds of this gain credited to DICE. This potential additional production added $500 million to the net present value of Jansen stage 1. In consideration of this, among other factors, the BHP board of directors approved the transition of the Jansen project from a prefeasibility to a feasibility study. ¬© 2018 INFORMS.},

abstract={Despite boards of directors‚Äô prominent involvement in strategic alliance (SA) decisions in practice and reports from news media, there is relatively little academic research exploring the board's value for a firm's technical SA investments involving a technical transfer or R&D, which are characterized by a high level of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and extreme complexity. Anchored in the resource dependence theory, this study aims to address this important issue by examining how board of directors contribute their human capital, in the form of relevant strategic experience, may mitigate the core challenges managers face when pursuing technical SAs and thereby influencing their outcomes. Our empirical results show that when outside directors hold more extensive alliance experience, they can better execute their consulting function and improve the firm's technical alliance performance. In addition, directors with experience specifically related to technical alliances also have a positive effect on performance. Last, we find that the impact of alliance experience on technical alliance performance is positively moderated by the size of directors‚Äô prior affiliated companies and their share ownership in the focal firm. ¬© 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the ‚Äúscope of operations‚Äù hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The perceived economic value of an independent boardroom configuration has progressively emerged as a matter of considerable importance in the academic and popular literature. The normative research paradigm has fundamentally been dominated by positivists who formulate inferential models populated by large sets of archival data. Regrettably, however, several decades of intense inquiries and passionate debates have invariably failed to ascertain (or dispel) the economic value of an independent boardroom configuration. The lingering boardroom independence‚Äìcorporate performance saga has reached an impasse with no clear resolution in the foreseeable future. In this study, I provide a diagnosis (through the thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews) of why the economic viability of an independent boardroom remains an elusive phenomenon for positivist researchers. A central reason for the research impasse is attributed to ontological complexities intrinsic to the very nature of the corporation, compounded by multiple layers of methodological complexities. Ultimately, the disentanglement of this enigma would require a pivotal reconceptualization of the corporate governance research agenda. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. ¬© The Authors 2014.},

abstract={Purpose - The author's original approach helps to understand the executives and their decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach - The complexity of today's business requires the board of directors (BoD) to go beyond its traditional role of referee, and to become involved as appropriate with the business and with its top managers. The BoD should apply the 3<P>of governance: namely the official policies that tell it what to do and what not to do; a comprehensive process of governance that ensures the effectiveness of its activities; and, last but not least, basic psychology to understand the possible quirks of the top managers. This article complements the author's earlier contribution on the process of governance, and focuses on how the directors can monitor the behavioral patterns of the top managers and assess the impact on their decision making. Findings - The author recommends that the BoD uses the methodology of "Creating Business Value" described in this article. By providing transparency over the whole business system, it brings out the proficiency of the top management, and reveals dysfunctional attitudes. Practical implications - The advocated approach contributes to the effectiveness of the directors as they interact with the executive on critical issues. Originality/value - The author presents an application of "creating business value", an original and holistic methodology that enables all concerned to see where, why, how, and how much business value has been, or will likely be, added or destroyed throughout the enterprise. ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This main objective of this study is to examine the impact of a number of variables on the extent of corporate governance disclosure in a firm's annual report. The study analyzes the impact of different variables, including Size of audited company, the existence of audit committee, size of board of directors, number of non-executive members in the board of directors, separated between chairman of board of director and CEO, complexity of firm's operations, size of company, debt ratio, profitability, ownership concentration and the institutional shareholders) on this level of Disclosure of corporate governance. A disclosure index consisting of thirty-seven items of information covering corporate governance was applied to the annual reports of a sample of 64 companies listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the year 2010. The index is divided into two types of information: compulsory and voluntary. Regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between the extent of disclosure and the explanatory variables. The results of the study revealed that the disclosure level of compulsory items was high and there was no significant variations in the disclosure level between companies. On the other hand, the results indicated that the disclosure level of voluntary items was low and there was a significant variation between companies. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed that there is a positive and significant relationship between the level of corporate governance disclosure and the existence of audit committee, and the separated between the positions of chairman of board of director and CEO. Also, the study found a negative and significant relationship between the level of corporate governance disclosure and the number of non-executive directors in the board of directors. Finally, the study recommended the conduct of future research that may cover other aspects of the topic and incorporate new variables not covered by the current study. ¬© 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed businesses, enabling agile and cost-effective IT infrastructure. Both create new opportunities for entrepreneurial businesses and disruptive business models enabling growth. The challenge is that these new opportunities create a co-mingled architecture which is difficult to secure. The complexity of this architecture is magnified with the IoT. Based on interviews with executive leadership teams and boards of directors facing these new environments, we developed the over-arching research question: How do we secure increasingly dynamic architecture in an environment while supporting and creating agile business growth? We then narrowed this down to more specific questions dealt with in this study. The research involved an in-depth exploration of this problem using a survey instrument and multiple qualitative methods involving business leaders from 59 companies between 2017-2018. Based on this analysis, we developed an information security framework for executives in this new environment that builds on previous work. This framework is called the Extended Risk-Based Approach and provides businesses with an approach for securing an enterprise amidst the IoT and agile architecture. Importantly, the data analyzed suggests that this approach is critically needed to address the rapidly growing complexity of enterprise architecture and the digital world we live and work. ¬© 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing ‚Äúboard potential‚Äù;. A board that functions well through the directors‚Äô relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of ‚Äúboard capability‚Äù; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. ¬© 2015, ¬© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Solvency II leads to a new system of solvency requirements for insurance undertakings based on a risk-oriented approach. Risks have to be covered by own funds of the insurance undertakings. This academic legal paper analyzes and systemizes the new insurance related solvency system according to the Solvency II-directive, the proposed Level 2-Regulation and the proposed new German Insurance Supervision Act (VAG). It focuses then on the three problematic areas under the new solvency regime, i.e. complexity, volatility and procyclical effects. Finally it turns to the new roles, which the boards of directors and supervisory boards of insurance undertakings, the supervisory authorities, the courts and the academics will play in the Solvency II-process. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.},

abstract={The accepted history of managerial internal audit is that its origins are in financial and compliance auditing. Managerial was added after firms started to expand geographically or into other businesses. That expansion increased complexity and created problems for managers which the internal auditor assisted in solving with managerial audits. Contrary to that two stage development, something comparable to managerial internal audit was being practiced by the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company in the form of inspections as early as 1871. Rather than in financial and compliance auditing, these inspections had their geneses in the desire of the senior manager and the committee (board of directors) for additional information on the fur trade and retail operations. This paper will describe the inspection function at the historical Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, the circumstances leading to the development of this function, and how it complemented other controls. ¬© 2001, Academy of Accounting Historians.

abstract={Over four decades, research and policy have created layers of understandings in the quest for ‚Äúgood‚Äù corporate governance. The corporate excesses of the 1970s sparked a search for market mechanisms and disclosure to empower shareholders. The UK-focused problems of the 1990s prompted board-centric, structural approaches, while the fall of Enron and many other companies in the early 2000s heightened emphasis on director independence and professionalism. With the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì09, however, came a turn in some policy approaches and in academic literature seeking a different way forward. This paper explores those four phases and the discourse each develops and then links each to assumptions about accountability and cognition. After the financial crisis came pointers n policy and practice away from narrow, rationalist prescriptions and toward what the philosopher Stephen Toulmin calls ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù. Acknowledging that heightens awareness of complexity and interdependence in corporate governance practice. The paper then articulates a research agenda concerning what ‚Äúreasonably‚Äù good corporate governance might entail. ¬© 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Most prior studies have argued that the relationship between firm complexity and board size is a monotonic one: complex firm tend to have a large board size. Contrary to previous work, it is hypothesized in this study that this relationship is more likely to be moderated by board leadership structure. Using a sample of 92 Egyptian listed firms over the period from 2000 to 2004, we found that firm complexity exerted a positive and significant coefficient on board size when the firm adopts a leadership structure that separates the roles of CEO and chairman. However, the incremental effect of firm complexity on board size was negative and significant for firms that combine the roles of CEO and chairman (i.e., CEO duality). This study provides supportive evidence for the argument that firms are more likely to manipulate their boards' characteristics to attain organizational adaptation at the minimum total cost. Thus, studying of one main characteristic of the board of directors without taking into account the expected effect of other characteristics may lead to inconclusive evidence. This study offers insights to practising managers and policy makers. If practising managers want to maximize the value of their firms, they need to broaden their insight to understand that board characteristics are multidimensional, contingent and dynamic in their nature and differ not only across firms and industry, but also across countries. Moreover, before developing and launching new and additional corporate governance reforms, policy makers need to realize that differences in corporate governance systems cannot be fully explained outside their institutional environments.},

abstract={Using the complementary lenses of upper echelons and firm internationalization theories and combining them with executive compensation theory, this study tests the proposition that the increased complexity resulting from firm internationalization will require an alignment between top management team and board composition and compensation. In particular, we assert that the degree of nationality diversity of the top management team and board exerts potentially differential impact on firm performance depending, in part, on the level of executive compensation. Results from empirical tests on a sample of Swiss publicly listed companies support this assertion, suggesting that firms manage the additional complexity of internationalization by increasing the degree of nationality diversity of top management teams and boards. However, our findings also point to the importance of matching executive composition and compensation as we find growth of internationalization of top management teams and boards to be negatively directly related to performance, whereas higher levels of executive compensation acts as both moderator and mediator, exhibiting positive influence on performance.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper draws on prior studies on the readability of corporate financial disclosures to discuss why readability should be a concern for firms. Guidance and recommendations are offered to help firms improve their financial disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: The authors base their analysis on the management and accounting literature on readability. Findings: This paper presents the main causes and consequences of complexity in corporate disclosures and identifies four disclosure writing styles: obfuscation, informativeness, deception and avoidance. This paper suggests that firms concerned about the readability of their communications use a balanced strategy and proposes some practical actions for its implementation. Originality/value: This paper makes several contributions by offering insights into questions that should be raised by top management and the board of directors, including: Why care about readability? What are the causes and consequences of low readability? What strategies can we adopt and how should we implement them? ¬© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The use of political skill to further employees‚Äô self-interests and their ability to cope with ambiguity and employment vulnerability during periods of organizational change is an important yet under researched phenomenon. Taking a middle management perspective, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences of Richard, a newly appointed professional youth football Academy Manager during the process of organizational change. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, formal academy team meetings, co-worker interviews, and informal observations and conversations, which were analyzed through the process of narrative analysis. Findings highlighted the hierarchical sensemaking challenges of vertically ‚Äòmanaging up‚Äô (e.g. Chairman, Board of Directors, 1st Team Manager) and ‚Äòmanaging down‚Äô (e.g. academy employees), and horizontally ‚Äòmanaging across‚Äô (e.g. Head of Coaching) during the process of organizational change. Importantly, managing expectations and influencing significant others, through skilled micro-political activity, was central to successfully negotiating the ambiguity and vulnerabilities of organizational life during change. MAD statement This study is the first to examine the micro-political actions and behaviours of middle managers as both recipients and deliverers of organizational change. The self-interests of middle-managers tend to influence strategic change; however, we do not understand how middle-managers make sense of the micro-political nature of such interests during change. This study highlights the complexity of coping with employment vulnerability when negotiating and influencing the actions of senior management whilst also supporting subordinate staff with resistance and uncertainty during change. Furthermore, the micro-political actions and strategies of a middle-manager to develop ‚Äòtrust‚Äô amongst colleagues, both vertically ‚Äòabove‚Äô and ‚Äòbelow‚Äô them, and horizontally ‚Äòacross‚Äô from them in the organizational hierarchy, are evidenced. ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper examines the relation between corporate governance mechanisms and earnings management. Using data collected from New Zealand listed companies for the financial year ending in 2005, the results show that the size of the board of directors is significantly positively associated with earnings management. This suggests that larger boards seem to be ineffective in their oversight duties relative to smaller boards. On the other hand, the independence of the board of directors, the independent role of the board chair and chief executive officer, and the independence of audit committees are not significantly associated with earnings management. Thus, these three corporate governance mechanisms are ineffective at monitoring the discretionary choices of management. The lack of effective corporate governance in New Zealand, particularly with regard to boards of directors, is mainly due to the lack of "experience and skills required to oversee the scale, complexity, and characteristics of finance operations" (Ministry of Economic Development, 2009, p.8).},

abstract={Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.},

abstract={In 2004, Spain's Banco Santander purchased Britain's Abbey National Bank in a deal valued at fifteen billion dollars--an acquisition that made Santander one of the ten largest financial institutions in the world. Here, Mauro Guill√©n and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents. Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guill√©n and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking. Building a Global Bank tells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it. ¬© 2008 by Princeton University Press.

abstract={As the 21st century approaches, there are many pressures prompting changes in corporate board behavior. The author characterizes the current responses as TQM (more of the same, only better) or reengineering (transformation). To respond adequately to the reality and complexities of a global economy, the author argues that approaches to both corporate governance and boards are in need of reengineering. Directions for board transformation are illustrated with a new framework based on the orientation and constitution of boards. Five new board configurations and the path of evolution are presented.},

abstract={We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Previous research has often focused on the board of directors as the primary actor in the governance of membership-based organizations (MBOs). This chapter aims at a broader approach to MBOs‚Äô internal democratic governance systems by casting the rank-and-file members as the main actors. Drawing on two models, one dealing with member influence and the other portraying single- and multilevel MBOs, the chapter discusses key elements in these organizations‚Äô governance systems, including statutes, the board of directors, nomination committees, lay auditors, modes of member influence, appointment of elected representatives, annual meetings and general assemblies. The intent of the chapter is to raise awareness regarding the scope and complexity of governance in MBOs and to suggest some directions for future research. ¬© Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.},

abstract={In this chapter, Smith and Cockburn reaffirm their claim in a previous book that today's global business contexts are volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA), and leaders must focus more on complex thinking skills and mindsets than developing behavioral competencies. In so doing, leaders must be familiar with the benefits and drawbacks of emerging digital technologies and use these technologies appropriately. In the previous book, the authors defined flexible and dynamic leadership models that assure success in the above contexts and described learning related processes essential to mastering the ability to adapt at rates consistent with the business complexity leaders now face. In this chapter, they extend their previous research and review newly emergingfactors contributing to global business complexity in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) and explain how these elements may be applied by leaders, including CEOs and Boards of Directors, to augment the power of their recommended leadership models. ¬© 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={Most prior studies have argued that the relationship between firm complexity and board size is a monotonic one: complex firm tend to have a large board size. Contrary to previous work, it is hypothesized in this study that this relationship is more likely to be moderated by board leadership structure. Using a sample of 92 Egyptian listed firms over the period from 2000 to 2004, we found that firm complexity exerted a positive and significant coefficient on board size when the firm adopts a leadership structure that separates the roles of CEO and chairman. However, the incremental effect of firm complexity on board size was negative and significant for firms that combine the roles of CEO and chairman (i.e., CEO duality). This study provides supportive evidence for the argument that firms are more likely to manipulate their boards' characteristics to attain organizational adaptation at the minimum total cost. Thus, studying of one main characteristic of the board of directors without taking into account the expected effect of other characteristics may lead to inconclusive evidence. This study offers insights to practising managers and policy makers. If practising managers want to maximize the value of their firms, they need to broaden their insight to understand that board characteristics are multidimensional, contingent and dynamic in their nature and differ not only across firms and industry, but also across countries. Moreover, before developing and launching new and additional corporate governance reforms, policy makers need to realize that differences in corporate governance systems cannot be fully explained outside their institutional environments.},

abstract={Research Question/Issue: What combinations of board attributes and contextual factors explain boards' selective distribution of attention between their dual role of resource provisioning and monitoring? At the board level, we consider board structure and breadth of knowledge, while the context in which boards operate is captured by the degree of external scrutiny, operational complexity, performance, and ownership structure. Research Findings/Insights: Our study demonstrates that there are multiple ways board attributes bundle and combine with important elements of the context to promote similar board attention structures. Our findings provide evidence of the causal complexity underlying this phenomenon and corroborate the notions of equifinality and asymmetric causality among board-, firm-, and institution-level conditions conducive to boards allocating more attention to either their resource provisioning or monitoring roles. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings support the attention-based view (ABV), suggesting that boards' selective distribution of attention is regulated by the combination of skills and knowledge directors bring to the firm and the stimuli provided by contextual factors. In doing so, we underscore the need for an extended theory on board effectiveness, as resource dependence- and agency-based prescriptions about boards' behavior may be incomplete, since there is limited consideration by these theories of the bounded rationality of directors and the complex relationships between the factors that can frame boards' selective distribution of attention. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study informs efforts to disentangle the conditions under which different attributes combine and regulate boards' distribution of attention, which has implications for nomination committees and powerful actors who have influence on board appointments. Because our results reveal several causal paths that can promote similar board attention structures, decision makers may wish to recruit directors with specific attributes that will be the best fit for the firm's contextual conditions. ¬© 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The complexity of regulations governing investigator-initiated trials (IITs) places a great burden on hospitals. Consequently, many hospitals seek to alleviate regulatory pressures by seeking an alternative quality management system (QMS). This paper takes the Netherlands as a case. To investigate how QMSs for IITs are organized in Dutch hospitals, we adopted the theoretical concepts of mentoring and monitoring in a mixed methods study in the period 2014‚Äì2018. In clinical practice and international guidelines, monitoring is seen as the standard quality assurance for ongoing trials. However, hospitals have implemented monitoring programs that resemble mentoring. The contrast between these ideal types is less pronounced in practice as both combine elements of compliance and feedback for learning in practice. In a monitoring setting, learning is one-way, from monitor to researcher; whereas mentoring focuses on mutual support and learning. To tackle problems in each system, the authority of the Board of Directors (BoD) and the BoD‚Äôs relationship with staff members are crucial. We discuss the challenges that BoD and staff face in keeping an integrated view of the various components of QMSs. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Learning outcomes: This case study aims to expect the following learning outcomes. A better understanding of the nature of a psychological contract being developed by employees in non-profit organizations, especially working in the areas of social development and the impact of this contract on employee commitment. Enhanced understanding of conflict of interest (personal versus public) in social development organizations and its implications. Identification of issues of task conflict versus interpersonal conflict and its impact on organizational functions. Identification of dynamics of exclusion of internal stakeholders from organizational strategic decision-making process along with its impact on organizational performance and sustainability. Devising a mechanism to avoid such conflicts in social development organizations, in particular, and organizations in general. Case overview/synopsis: This case highlights five issues as follows: it identifies and discusses conflict of interest between privileged class possessing decision-making positions in the board of directors and implementers working at the grassroots level at ANMOL (a non-governmental organization working for poor girls education in Baluchistan-hub of China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor); it discusses the basis for formulation of psychological contracts and impact of its violation on stakeholder‚Äôs commitment and motivation; it discusses the implications of difference of opinion of both stakeholders regarding organizational vision and possible drawbacks of converting task conflict into interpersonal conflict on individuals, organization and end-users; it explores implications of exclusion of key stakeholders from organizational decision-making and its impact on organizational smooth working and sustainability; and it suggests a mechanism to avoid conversion of task conflict into interpersonal conflict and smooth functioning of an organization. Hence, this case discusses theories of conflict of interest between top-leadership and workforce, psychological contract and implications of its breach on employee motivation and organizational sustainability in the context of social development organizations. Complexity academic level: This case provides sufficient material to be discussed at master level courses (management sciences ‚Äì master of business administration (MBA) level) such as human resource management (dynamics of psychological contract and conflict resolution), leadership and change management in social development organizations (social enterprises).

abstract={Theoretical basis: Financial accounting to assess stewardship: the case requires students to evaluate Thompson‚Äôs stewardship of McDonald‚Äôs, in part based on the company‚Äôs financial accounting information. Financial reporting performs an important societal role by helping control agency problems that arise from the separation of ownership and management. Since external stakeholders cannot ‚Äúobserve directly the extent and quality of managerial effort on their behalf [‚Ä¶] the manager may be tempted to shirk [‚Ä¶] blaming any deterioration of firm performance on factors beyond his/her control‚Äù (Scott, 2014, p. 23). However, although financial reporting helps hold managers accountable to shareholders, accounting information is not fully informative about managerial effort. For example, while net income provides useful information regarding the CEO‚Äôs stewardship, it is also ‚Äúnoisy,‚Äù due to recognition lags and other factors (Scott, 2014, p. 364). Efforts undertaken by Thompson in a particular period, such as marketing expenditures, might reduce current earnings, yet boost future profitability. Additionally, Thompson‚Äôs predecessor‚Äôs past efforts might have positive or negative effects on current earnings. Evaluating stewardship effectively involves considerable judgment, in addition to knowledge of financial accounting. The implication of poor firm performance is that the CEO is ineffective at formulating and implementing strategies and policies to enhance firm value (Dikolli et al., 2014). Specifically, it appears that missing earnings benchmarks matter more for relatively inexperienced CEOs. Don Thompson‚Äôs tenure of 33 months at McDonalds is 42 percent lower than median CEO tenure documented in academic research, where the median tenure of chief executives documented in large sample empirical studies is about 57 months (Dikolli et al., 2014). The evidence suggests that the longer a CEO serves, the less likely he is to be dismissed for performance-related reasons. This appears to be the result of the resolution of uncertainty about CEO‚Äôs ability and leads to subsequent declines in the level of monitoring by the Board of Directors. Performance evaluation and bias: a significant body of research explores the extent to which female managers are assessed differently than their male counterparts (Powell and Butterfield, 2002). For example, female CEOs face more threats from activist investors than male CEOs. Therefore, even after women achieve the highest managerial rank, they experience more professional challenges than their male counterparts (Gupta et al., 2018). However, the question of whether black CEOs are assessed differently is more challenging to answer empirically as a result of a smaller sample size (only one percent of S&P 500 companies are run by black CEOs). Our case attempts to develop the inference that if female CEOs are subject to bias, analogous forces are likely at work when black CEOs are assessed. Recent evidence further suggests that business students sometimes demonstrate bias in making assessments (Mengel et al., 2018). The authors discuss these findings ‚Äì as well as strategies for including them in the case discussion ‚Äì in the ‚ÄúTeaching Strategy‚Äù section herein below. Research methodology: The case was written from the public record surrounding the appointment of Don Thompson and McDonald‚Äôs company filings. The record includes articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as local and industry publications. Case overview/synopsis: The case examines the role of financial accounting in evaluating CEO performance in the context of the appointment of McDonald‚Äôs first African-American chief executive and his subsequent two-and-a-half years on the job. The case deepens students‚Äô understanding of the link between financial reporting and stewardship, while highlighting the subjectivity inherent in assessing managerial performance, particularly over relatively short time periods. As students analyze the case, they must consider the extent to which a firm‚Äôs results are attributable to luck vs skill. We use ‚Äúskill‚Äù to refer to CEO effort and other controllable factors, while ‚Äúluck‚Äù refers to exogenous factors, such as macroeconomic conditions. Assessing stewardship is of practical significance. It allows pay to be better aligned with performance and empowers stakeholders to identify when a change of leadership may be warranted. The case may also be used to spur reflection, in an applied context, on the importance of being alert to unconscious bias, even when evaluating seemingly objective financial reporting data. Recent research, discussed herein, suggests that business students sometimes exhibit bias when making assessments. Complexity academic level: The case should be included in discussions of corporate governance, executive compensation and the role of accounting information in efficient contracting. It is appropriate in intermediate financial accounting courses for undergraduates, introductory graduate accounting courses, or other courses with an element of financial statement analysis. Standard introductory accounting textbooks offer helpful supplementary reading for students. Horngren et al.‚Äôs (2014) book, Introduction to Financial Accounting (12th ed.), Pearson, London, provides an overview of the income statement and its role in assessing performance (see Chapter 2) as well as a useful discussion on evaluating the components and trends of a business (see Chapter 12). More advanced students may benefit from the in-depth discussion of earnings quality, operating income and non-operating income found in Chapter 4 of Intermediate Accounting (9th ed.), McGraw Hill Education, New York by Spiceland et al. (2018). ¬© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION The title ‚Äúin-house counsel movement‚Äù has been used since the end of the 1980s to describe what began as an American phenomenon entailing the numeric growth, increased prestige, and growing professional value afforded to lawyers working within company legal departments on the company‚Äôs legal matters (Rosen 1989; Wilkins 2012). Rosen focuses on how corporate lawyers went from being ‚Äúkept‚Äù counsel in the 1920s, to ‚Äútame lawyers‚Äù in the 1950s, to ‚Äúin-house counsel‚Äù in the 1980s. Nor was Rosen alone in marking this transition. Beginning in the mid-1980s, scholars studying the legal profession began to note that inside legal departments, and the legal executives leading them, were increasingly valued within their companies and the legal profession as a whole. Chayes and Chayes write: Not only have [in-house counsel] offices grown in size, but in importance as well. The general counsel sits close to the top of the corporate hierarchy as a member of senior management. There is a comparable increase in the importance and complexity of matters dealt with internally. (Chayes and Chayes 1985, 277) Indeed, Chayes and Chayes found that legal directors in large US corporations were gaining relevance within internal corporate hierarchies as they began taking part in the strategic decision-making process of the company. Many were being integrated into higher levels in the corporate hierarchy as members of management, with some even being included on the company‚Äôs board of directors (Coates et al. 2011). Early studies of the changing role of in-house counsel also showed that there was a trend to begin carrying out new types of legal services and implementing new methods when managing conflict. For instance, legal departments began performing new activities, such as preventive legal consulting by foreseeing potential conflicts by implementing long-term planning and establishing managing plans for litigation as well as managing legal services by outsourced law firms (Chayes and Chayes 1985, 200). In the almost three decades since this initial work, David B. Wilkins has argued that this the trend of enhancing the value of in-house counsels in the United States and around the world is not over (Wilkins 2012). More specifically, he argues that the prestige of in-house counsel and, in particularly GCs, continues to rise. He notes, that in-house counsel increasingly interact with top company executives, including the board, when advising and solving legal needs in their companies. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2018.},

abstract={This Article provides a legal overview and analysis of the benefits associated with the adoption of a staggered board of directors by Italian banks and public companies. While there is a widespread opposition to staggered boards among U.S. scholars and investors - being such device a powerful antitakeover measure in the American legal system since directors belonging to a U.S. staggered board may be removed only "for cause" - this Article explains the reasons why staggered boards should be implemented by Italian banks and public companies considering the significant distinctions between the U.S. and the European legal frameworks in this area. Taking into account the new banking governance principles recently introduced by CRD IV and by its implementing measures, this Article explains how the establishment of staggered boards by Italian credit institutions and listed companies may allow them (i) to exclude the risk of potential discontinuities in the management's action, which are inappropriate in corporations of such complexity and systemic relevance, (ii) to facilitate the initial induction and training of the newly appointed directors and officers, who would benefit from the expertise of other members of the board with longer experience, (iii) to strengthen and foster the institutional dialogue between the board and the shareholders, aimed at achieving an adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body, and finally (iv) to attract more capital from professional investors, granting them the possibility to appoint their representatives in the board on an annual basis.},

abstract={Purpose Many corporate managers, with the aid of the board of directors, discovered that they could provide themselves with guaranteed or excessive compensation by manipulating the terms of stock option grants that were included in their compensation packages. This paper seeks to examine the legal, tax, and accounting issues that have evolved because of these suspect illegal activities. Design/methodology/approach The author presents the theory behind performance-based compensation that is the basis for employee stock option grants. The author then examines regulations, judicial theory, and court cases to determine the current legal status of backdating, spring loading, or bullet dodging of executive stock option grants. Findings The current legal environment has made it difficult for executives to continue the practice of manipulating stock option grants without falling under the ire of regulators and shareholders. However, a question remains whether executives that manipulated stock option grants in the past will be found criminally liable for their acts. Practical implications The paper's review of the discourse on the legality of corporate executives enhancing their compensation packages shows the complexity of detecting and regulating this type of suspect activity. Originality/value This paper presents a contemporaneous discussion and data on legal and regulatory changes that resulted from management malfeasance of executive compensation. ¬© Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

abstract={Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.},

Neither of the decision analysis models presented to the respective Boards of Directors was at all complex mathematically but they were highly influential on the decision-making processes. Indeed both were critical to the decisions made at those times. Some possible lessons are drawn from the cases with respect to these types of decision-making process, the type and complexity of model appropriate and information problems. ¬© 1982 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={The literature on nonprofit governance and boards has grown substantially during the past 50 years as researchers from a variety of disciplines and fields have studied governance systems and processes to examine how they are organized, the practices they employ, and their relations with and impacts on nonprofits. This essay offers a domain-based narrative review of the research on the governance of nonprofit organizations and how it has developed over these 50 years. Building on literature reviews and a Delphi study, we summarize the progression of nonprofit governance research, employ a multi-dimensional framework to summarize and assess the state of the field, and offer recommendations for future study. We find the increasingly multinational and multicultural literature of the field has become more rich, nuanced, and increasingly inclusive of contingency, complexity, paradox, and the diverse theoretical perspectives that will enhance our understanding of nonprofit governance. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Credit unions compete directly with commercial banks in markets for consumer financial services yet receive an exemption from federal corporate income tax. Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit, cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant principal‚Äìagent literature, we provide several arguments to support the hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that credit union CEOs receive approximately 250% less performance-based compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank CEOs also earn approximately 15% to 20% more total compensation on average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and risk. The findings suggest important differences in incentive structures and objectives between banks and credit unions. ¬© 2022 Edgard Milhaud Foundation.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61‚Äì97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin‚Äôs Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin‚Äôs Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin‚Äôs Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin‚Äôs Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin‚Äôs Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait‚Äôs corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance‚Äìfirm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets. ¬© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016‚Äì2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. ¬© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professionals, managers, and other key employees‚Äô experiences of oilcloth sessions as a strategy when implementing new emergency departments in Denmark, based on their participations in these sessions. The study addresses the importance of securing alignment in implementation strategies. Too often, this does not get enough attention in the literature and in practice. In this study, alignment among components was achieved in an educational implementation strategy called oilcloth sessions. Methods: The study is based on participants‚Äô observations of 13 oilcloth sessions and follow-up via 53 semi-structured interviews with the board of directors, managers, and key employees from the present emergency department and different specialty departments. Data were analysed deductively using Biggs and Tang‚Äôs model of didactic alignment. Results: The analysis showed the complexity of challenges when using oilcloth sessions as a strategy when implementing a new emergency department described in terms of three phases and nine main themes (a‚Äìi): the preparation phase: (a) preparing individually and collectively, (b) objectives, (c) involving participants, (d) selecting cases; the execution phase: (e) using materials, (f) facilitating the sessions, (g) temporal structures; evaluation: (h) following up on the sessions, (i) adapting to the context. Conclusions: This study shows that it is important to ensure alignment among elements in implementation strategies. Thus, oilcloth sessions with high alignment are useful if the challenges experienced are to be overcome and the strategy will be experienced as a useful way to support the implementation of a new emergency department from the participants‚Äô point of view. Bigg and Tang's didactic model is useful as an analytical framework to ensure alignment in implementation strategies in general. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: Given the huge investment and complexity of information technology, it is imperative that boards of directors fully play their important role in promoting firms' IT success. This study aims to investigate the effects of boards of directors' external ties on firms' IT success from the perspective of resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: According to the method of the matched sample comparison group, a total of 576 samples of listed enterprises in three periods were obtained. Findings: Results show that both boards' political ties and boards' business ties have a positive impact on firms' IT success. Environmental uncertainty and the institutional environment play different roles in the relationships between two types of external ties and firms' IT success. Specifically, the results show that the institutional environment can regulate the influence of the political association of directors on firms' IT success negatively. In addition, environmental uncertainty regulates the influence of directors' political association on firms' IT success negatively, as well as the influence of directors' commercial association with firms' IT success. Research limitations/implications: The external ties were measured by cross-sectional data. And the current study focused on two fundamental types of external ties. Originality/value: Boards' external ties are studied from both political and business perspectives, and the effects of these two types of external ties on firms' IT success are compared. Additionally, the moderating effects of the institutional environment (macro level) and environmental uncertainty (micro level) in these relationships are investigated. ¬© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This book will explore a new approach to airport planning that better captures the complexities and velocity of change in our contemporary world. As a result, it will lead to higher performing airports for users, business partners, investors and other stakeholders. This is especially pertinent since airports will need to come back better from the Covid-19 pandemic. The book explains the importance of articulating a clear strategy, based on a rigorous analysis of the competitive landscape while avoiding the pitfalls of ambiguity and 'virtue signalling'. Having done so, demand forecasts can be developed that resemble S-curves, not simple straight lines, that reflect strategic opportunities and threats from which a master plan can be developed to allocate land and capital in a way that maximizes return on assets and social licence. The second distinctive feature of this book is the premise that planning an airport as an island, a fortress even, does not work anymore given how interconnected airports are with other components of the transportation system, the economies and communities they serve and the rapid pace of social and technological change. In summary, the book argues that airport planning needs to move beyond its traditional boundaries. The book is replete with real examples from airports of all sizes around the world and includes practical advice and tools for executives and managers. It is recommended reading for individuals working in the airport business or the broader air transport industry, members of airports' board of directors, who may be new to the business, elected officials, policy makers and urban planners in jurisdictions hosting or adjacent to airports, regulators, economic development professionals and, finally, students. ¬© 2022 Mike Brown.

abstract={Severance packages are granted to senior executives to mitigate management problems, such as risk aversion. When the incentive plan stipulates the acquisition of control as a hypothesis for triggering the indemnity, the benefit takes the form of a golden parachute and works as a defensive measure against hostile acquisitions by increasing the cost of the operation for the acquirer. It is understood that the evaluation of the board of directors performance in the executive pay approval must be based on the convenience of the instrument for social interest, which requires an institutional analysis. Both the ownership structure and the market for corporate control are relevant elements to determine if the incentive seeks to fulfill the purpose for which it is being planned, especially when the threat of hostile acquisitions is used as a justification for implementation. Therefore, based on the HRT Case, the severance pay is analyzed in observance of the Brazilian capital market characteristics. Although it does not represent all the complexity of the issue, the case chosen is a portrait of a specific reality and offers important thoughts for an efficient regulation of executive pay in Brazil. This work intends to demonstrate that Comiss√£o de Valores Mobili√°rios [CVM] took into account purely theoretical benefits of the severance pay and did not incorporate the brazilian stock market specificities in the analysis, a decision that brought losses to HRT Participa√ß√µes em Petr√≥leo S/A shareholders. ¬© 2022 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

abstract={Purpose: In this paper, the impact of stock-based compensation and further the joint effects of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment on pension discount rate choice is examined. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses is tested using fixed effects models and instrumental variable analysis where pension discount rate is the dependent variable, and stock-based compensation and investor sentiment are our variables of interest. Findings: It was found that pension discount rate is negatively associated with managers' stock-based compensation. Further analysis indicates that managers with larger stock-based compensation tend to adjust down their pension discount rates in higher (smaller) degree, responding to high (low) investor sentiment. Practical implications: The findings provide important insights into how managers use pension discount rates to engage in earnings management. Understanding these relationships has implications for interpreting pension numbers reported in the financial statements and designing pension accounting rules that minimize the possibility that managers take advantage of the complexity associated with pension accounting to influence the reported earnings and executive compensation. Moreover, the findings suggest the need for increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to reported pension liabilities and service costs, especially for firms paying higher proportion of stock-based compensation to managers and during periods of high investor sentiment. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the extant literature by identifying the joint impacts of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment as incentives for pension discount rate manipulation. The empirical results of this study also have important implications for corporate governance and regulation. ¬© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: This case study aims to ensure that, students should be able to recognise the behaviours that influence the in-member out-member categorisation that transpires in the workplace, both from the leader‚Äôs perspective and that of the followers; determine and understand the relevance of forming interpersonal relationships in the workplace and that interpersonal relationships create fundamentally positive or negative work experiences and impact on career opportunities in the workplace; gain an understanding of the internal bias and subjective comfort that leaders must actively overcome to establish an environment in which the entire team becomes in-group members; and be able to assess the contextual variables that contribute to the negative or positive aggravation of the leader‚Äìmember exchange. Case overview/synopsis: It was 16 October 2014, and Nonkululeko Gobodo, Executive Chair of accounting firm SizweNtsalubaGobodo, was looking to her younger sister, Notemba Dlova, for emotional support, as she sought to address an important issue that was on the agenda of the firm‚Äôs board of directors‚Äô meeting the following day. Tensions between her and Victor Sekese, Chief Executive Officer of the firm, were mounting, and a number of the directors were unhappy with the status quo. ‚ÄúHow do you think I should address the issue?‚Äù she asked Dlova. Both sisters knew that at stake was Gobodo‚Äôs future at the firm she had battled so hard to build up in the face of racial and gender stereotypes. Complexity academic level: The case study is appropriate for use in a range of postgraduate courses aimed at Master‚Äôs in Management and Master of Business Administration (MBA)-level students. It is also suitable for use in postgraduate diplomas in business and executive education short courses. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

abstract={Theoretical basis: Later in the discussion, the options for long run strategy in dealing with a possible takeover offer and other strategic options can be discussed by the class. Lack of familiarity by students with the role of the outside potential acquirer of the camp (in this case, a hotel chain) and the lack of familiarity with the role of an investor who is a family investor, who may wish to sell stock and use the proceeds for another purpose, or a small investor who invests because he or she uses the camp and takes advantage of the stockholder‚Äôs discount will probably preclude role playing, except in executive MBA classes where students have sufficient experience in possible takeover situations or in investment management, Emphasis should probably be placed on discussing the major issues, such as social and cultural issues and on marketing and public relations issues and on financial issues, including the options available in the event of a possible takeover effort. All of these issues are impacted fully by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research methodology: Instructors will need to play an active role in teaching this case. It is recommended that the instructor give a short lecture or discussion at the beginning as to how a camp such as Camp Teddy functions. The authors recommend that the instructor then begin the case discussion by asking students questions about such issues as social and cultural issues and marketing and public relations issues. Case overview/synopsis: Camp Teddy is a seasonal camp for families in rural Connecticut adjacent to New York City and suburbs in New York and Connecticut. It is technically a for-profit organization but operates more like a nonprofit organization because many of the campers own shares and have used the camp sometimes for several generations. The camp has traditions that are liked by many of the shareholders and campers. Although net income has increased in the past year, there does not seem to be enough funds to support necessary capital expenditures to improve facilities for the future. The largest stockholder has recently died. His immediate heirs‚Äô control 300 of the 1,000 shares and other family members control 400 shares with the remaining 300 shares in the hands of small shareholders, many of whom use the camp each summer. A large hotel chain is interested in possibly acquiring the camp through a buyout or perhaps a hostile takeover, with a potential large gain to shareholders. The board of directors must consider a number of issues to insure good occupancy of the camp in the future and must decide what to do about a potential takeover attempt. Complexity academic level: This case can be used in several courses, including investment management, hospitality management, corporate finance and business strategy. There are ethical and societal issues in the case, so that the case might also be used in courses looking at business, environment or business ethics. The case is best used at the graduate level, but it might be suitable for some advanced undergraduate courses. ¬© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Traditional agency theory views the proper role of the board chair exclusively as providing independent oversight to monitor and control the CEO. Recently, firms have introduced innovations in board leadership that have confounded these theoretical expectations. One notable innovation is the executive board chair, a corporate governance hybrid responsible for both oversight and strategic decision-making, challenging agency theory's prescription that the two activities remain separate. In this study, we argue that an executive board chair position can resolve the trade-off between independent oversight and involvement in strategy and therefore generate a performance advantage. We also predict that, owing to the blurring of lines between the CEO and board chair roles that the executive board chair position creates, the relationship will be stronger the greater the need to monitor and control the CEO but weaker when organizational complexity and board leadership demands are greater. Analysis of S&P 1500 firms from 2003 to 2017 provides general support for our arguments. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The learning outcome of this paper is to identify and interpret the risks linked to cyber-security and their impact on the organization. Analyze business management regarding cyber-security and information technology (IT) risk management. Evaluate and propose decision-making strategies for IT projects. Case overview/synopsis: Silver Bank is a financial entity with broad national coverage. Its growth was directly related to its investments in customer service. The entire organization is focused on satisfying its clients‚Äô needs, improving their experience and making them loyal to the company. However, it did not pay enough attention to a threat that, with time, had become more pronounced: cyber-attacks. Its efforts to fight against this threat were only temporary solutions, as gaps in its IT system made it an easy target for criminals until the arrival of Iv√°n Ram√≠rez, who proposes a holistic solution to decrease the probability and severity of these attacks. However, past experiences, ignorance and budget constraints make it a difficult task to convince the bank‚Äôs board of directors to implement the proposed solution.

abstract={This paper investigates the dynamics of complexity and expertise in the context of compensation committees (ccs). Drawing on semi-structured interviews, mostly with cc members and consultants, we bring to light two axes of subordination that impact the mindset of corporate governance participants, and may ultimately undermine directors‚Äô degree of accountability to shareholders. The first axis involves cc members‚Äô subordination to consultant expertise, which tends to be considered as an indispensable ally in dealing appropriately with the webs of complexity that allegedly characterize executive compensation. Nourished partially by the first axis, the second implies subservience to these webs of complexity, which are widely presumed and naturalized by cc members and the consulting experts they employ. One of our main contributory statements is to question the ascendancy of complexity in the boardroom, casting doubt on one of the key assumptions upon which practices and expertise in contemporary corporate governance institutions are built and promoted. We also question the extent of epistemic dependency in many compensation committees, where much of the knowledge necessary to properly operate the repertoire of practices (deemed necessary to address the problem of executive compensation determination) is not primarily in the hands of cc members, but rather in those of consultants. ¬© 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

abstract={This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The main objectives of this case are to provide an opportunity for case users to understand the organisational governance framework in a farmers' association and how to build an effective organisational board. More specifically, the teaching objectives of this case are as follows: to provide an overview of the functions of different types of governance structures in a farmers' association. To understand the importance of good governance practices in a farmers' association and for its stakeholders. To relate democratic theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory and stewardship theory with the governance practices of a farmers' association. To critically evaluate the board governance in a farmers' association and recommend measures to enhance the practices. Case overview/synopsis: The teaching case presents the governance practices in a farmers' association in Malaysia, ZIX-PPK and the various governance challenges that emerged in the PPK subsequent to the appointment of politically affiliated directors. Prior to 2019, ZIX-PPK was an outstanding PPK under the helm of the General Manager, Khadijah. The PPK had continually been recognised as an exceptional and excellent PPK by the Farmers' Organisation Authority and the Muda Agricultural Development Authority. However, the Arahan Pendaftar Bil 1/2019 required changes to the governance structures of ZIX-PPK, with five new directors being appointed by the minister. The appointment threatened the independence and autonomy of ZIX-PPK and affected the dynamic of the board of directors. Khadijah had to search for measures that could improve the board governance in ZIX-PPK. The names, in this case, had been altered but the details were based on an actual event. The data were collected through interviews with key players and with reference to the minutes and other documentation of ZIX-PPK. Complexity academic level: The teaching case can be used by students in higher education institutions at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The case may also be relevant for training purposes to farmers' associations and any non-profit organisations. Subject code: CSS 1: Accounting and Finance.

abstract={Learning outcomes: Illustrate the typical organizational responsibility of a small, medium industry dealing with precision manufacturing products. Introduce a balanced scorecard (BSC) as a concept about the case in the context. Introduce the parameters specific to small and medium enterprise (SME) that could be considered to be part of the key performance indicators. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using a BSC in SMEs in emerging economies. Case overview/ synopsis: Gopika Rani, the recently hired Executive Assistant along with Sanjana M, the Business Development Manager of SEP India Private Ltd. (SEPI), a small medium enterprise, were finalizing a proposal for the forthcoming ‚ÄúIndia Small Business Excellence Awards 2020.‚Äù The proposal was to be considered by the Board of Directors scheduled to meet next week for approvals. Sanjana apprises Gopika on CRISIL‚Äôs policy advisory role and its annual awards scheme for SMEs in India. She also details recent modifications announced by the Government of India that had impacted SEPI and was pertinent for filling the application. Gopika understood that SEPI was well-known for the precision and durability of its component, and was poised for growth. The business catered to global suppliers (Tier-1 companies) of the Indian automotive industry that accounted for over 75% and the balance contributed to exports. SEPI‚Äôs unique products such as Starter Motor Ignition or the Fuel Vending pump (Automotive) or the non-automotive products such as arrowheads and bowstrings (sports) or the heart-valves (medical) have all the quality certifications. For new product development, customer feedback played a crucial role at all stages of development from prototype to pilot tests. SEPI‚Äôs mission ‚Äúbe our customers‚Äô preferred supplier and business partner‚Äù drove their personnel and organizational objectives. Also, SEPI could get multiple benefits and be in a strong market position because of this award recognition. Gopika was, however, unclear about SEPI‚Äôs business strategies and use of appropriate performance measurement tools. Gopika desired to address the Board of Directors next week on her idea of applying a BSC as a useful ‚Äústrategic planning and management tool.‚Äù The BSC methodology can be used to monitor the performance of SME firms against strategic goals. It can be successfully implemented in smaller organizations because of their simpler set-ups and tendency to arrive at a consensus quickly. However, implementation of BSC within the Indian micro, small and medium enterprises has been scant. Several studies found that the lack of ownership, resistance to change, a scarcity of training and coordination between the departments and lack of funds were among the challenges. The firms also had to make numerous changes to their strategies as business environments evolved. Gopika was convinced that the tool could blend in all the ‚Äúfour perspectives ‚Äì customer, financial, internal business and learning and growth‚Äù and grow. The tool could demonstrate meeting all the prerequisites, ‚Äúneeds to have an exemplary vision, demonstrate outstanding business acumen, use best practices and create a legacy for the others to follow,‚Äù that were prerequisites for receipt of this award. Her next project would be to seek approval for the implementation of BSC, a beneficial and apt tool for SEPI. Do you agree with Gopika Rani that BSC is a suitable tool for SEPI? If yes, why? If no, why? Complexity academic level: This case study titled leveraging the BSC ‚Äì a tool for SME advancement is intended for use in the graduate management program (MBA) in subject electives, namely, entrepreneurship, strategy formulation, human resource management or production management.

abstract={Learning outcomes: Students learn to evaluate a firm‚Äôs growth strategies with the aim of establishing long-term business sustainability. Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm‚Äôs offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm‚Äôs internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term. Complexity academic level: This case could work well as part of an executive education course, as well as a strategic management course for master‚Äôs degree or Master of Business Administration students.

abstract={An established succession planning program for the identification and grooming of its next leader helps maintain the continuity of firm strategy and leadership style, which influences long-term firm performance and viability. Disclosure of succession planning information may alleviate investors‚Äô doubts about whether the firm has a succession planning plan, while it may increase competition for CEO candidates, leading to increases in the cost of securing qualified candidates. This study explores what determines firms‚Äô decisions to provide this disclosure using firms that initiate CEO succession planning disclosure in a given year and their control firms. We find that firms are more likely to initiate the disclosure of CEO succession planning when 1) segment concentration (negatively related to organizational complexity) becomes lower, 2) the board of directors becomes more independent, 3) the CEO has reached the retirement age of 64, 4) the CEO becomes more important relative to other executive officers in the industry labor market, 5) the number of analysts following (reflecting external monitoring) increases, and 6) CEO tenure (reflecting CEO entrenchment) declines. Overall, our findings suggest that the disclosure of CEO succession planning is motivated by investor demand for a smooth transition among top management and enhanced transparency in CEO succession planning. ¬© 2020, Korean Accounting Association.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to review the role of board size as part of the corporate governance system. This paper discusses one aspect of corporate governance, namely, boards, in the Indonesian context. Using the literature review method, this paper explores factors that need to be considered to determine the optimal number of boards, especially in Indonesia. We explore some determinants of board size, such as complexity and leverage, ownership structure, and financial ratio support. The results reveal that an understanding of the differences found in the two-tier board model helps us understand that the different functions of the board of commissioners and the board of directors require different test treatments from countries that adhere to one-tier systems. A review of the relationship between board size and company performance is expected to provide the corporate governance literature with insights into optimizing the sizes of boards that can improve company performance, both in terms of boards of commissioners and boards of directors. This paper proposes the simultaneous testing of board size‚Äôs relationship with company performance. The results of this study are expected to make a more real contribution about the effect of board size on company performance. ¬© Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

abstract={The ownership structure can strengthen or weaken the monitoring functions of the board. Therefore, it is intended in this article to analyse how the complexity of the ownership structure affects the relationship between intensive board monitoring and firm value. The study covers all the firms listed in the Saudi stock market, except the firms listed in the banking and insurance sectors, over the period 2008 till 2013. The results of the analysis reveal that the direct ownership of large shareholders in non-complex structures and the joint ownership between the government and family owners and individual investors both complement the monitoring functions of the board. Further the indirect ownership of ultimate owners in complex structures weakens the board monitoring intensity. Copyright ¬© 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Boards of directors are complex systems, and it is imperative to understand what the contextual forces are that shape the direction and make-up of boards. This Research Handbook provides inspiration for researchers and practitioners interested in the manifold dimensions and facets of context surrounding boards of directors. The contributions identify the complexity and multiplicity of contexts in which boards of directors work and operate, as well as indicating how board members interact with, and influence their contexts. The chapters explore national and institutional differences, divergent understandings of board requirements, climate change and boards‚Äô duties, transformation due to digitalisation, family firms, and micro-contextual dynamics affecting boards and their decisions. This Research Handbook promotes board accountability, questions the relative position of companies in society, and reconsiders governance from a multiple context, multi-actor perspective. Building a greater understanding of the main issues and theories surrounding boards of directors, this Research Handbook will be ideal for students and scholars of business and governance. Practitioners and policy makers can also find material for their evolving frameworks. ¬© Jonas Gabrielsson, Wafa Khlif and Sibel Yamak 2019. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The author meant to deepen the inspirations that lead to the evolution of a Public Health Care Enterprise. He, mainly, stressed the struggles of the Public Enterprise while perceiving the vision given by the Ruling Public Entity. The Public Enterprise pursues general interest‚Äôs targets operating via laws and rules to be converted into infrastractures and services through the performance of the free market. On the opposite, this free market, made of companies and professionals pursues mainly economical targets. To fulfil such a complex task the Public Entity has to take advantage from a management capable of overcoming the mere culture of the act and pairing with a culture that relies on relationship and value-creating behaviour. In this specific case, for an Health Care Public Company, the value is intended as the patient‚Äôs welfare. Fulfilling this challenge has a high degree of complexity, as Mintzberg has been stressing too, mainly for the interactions of different stakeholders (Board of Directors, Managers, Nurses, Doctors), among whom some are closer to the patients, while others are closer to the pure company businesses. The author has described the practical case of an incentive system implemented in an inhouse company which, in order to empower management figure like the Responsible of the Proceedings, has set a time & cost saving based MBO, giving different leverages in order to perceive it. The author has finally extended his analysis on the different ways to inspire/stimulate the management as training, project management and leadership. ¬© 2019, University of Urbino.

abstract={The article analyzes the results of an empirical study of mechanisms of regulation and coordination of interests among the participants of corporate governance at mediumsized industrial corporations in Tambov Region, Russia. The study was carried out by means of a content-analysis technique applied to annual corporate reports. The study summarizes the basic categories of content analysis, the frequency of the manifestations of signs by category, assessment of relations to the semantic content of signs. To verify results of content analysis the questionnaire of subjects and participants of corporate management was conducted. Survey was carried out on the basis of the target sample. In the course of the content-analysis, generalized data relating to the use of federal and internal legal norms applied to the medium-sized industrial corporations were obtained. A high degree of negative estimations of legal support of corporate activity was noted, which confirms the imperfection of the legislation, the existing gaps in it, contradictory legal provisions, and the complexity of regulatory framework. The survey revealed that the regulation of internal corporate activity is based on a limited list of corporate documents: the Charter of the Company and the Regulations of the Board of Directors. Interaction of participants of corporate relations on the basis of contracts has common flaws in their negotiation. Measures which can come at non-fulfillment of contracts on different circumstances that can create conditions for the conflict of interests of the parties aren‚Äôt registered in them. Questionnaire allowed to specify the characteristics of activity of bodies of corporate management received during the content analysis. The established average level of corporate governance within the industrial corporations of the Tambov Region provides the satisfactory level of balance of interactions of participants of the corporate relations. Level of protection of the property rights of key shareholders in general remains stable, and the level of protection of the rights of minority shareholders is estimated as satisfactory, control of Board of directors of administrative activity of top management is estimated above the average level. The survey confirmed relevance of a problem of the conflicts for average industrial corporations. The conflicts of interests most often happen between three groups of participants: shareholders and top managers; management and personnel; with competitors. The conflicts of interests in average corporations are overcome on the basis of priority satisfaction of interests, first of all - major shareholders, in the second turn - top managers. Interests of suppliers, local authorities, the personnel, small shareholders are poorly considered. The conflicts of interests are resolved on the basis of standards of the federal legislation, internal corporate documents, and contracts with constant partners. ¬© 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={This study investigates the role of the company secretary in ensuring and promoting proper Corporate Governance (CG) in public and private owned South African companies, so as to educate companies on their significance in reducing corporate scandals. The study followed a mixed research paradigm in which qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were used. Fifty questionnaires were sent to company secretaries of different business sectors giving a response rate of 78% with four of the participants telephonically interviewed to gather qualitative data. The study confirmed that the company secretary still plays a significant role in promoting CG by giving support and advising the board and its directors on CG matters. The results further show that some company secretaries are involved in director selection, performance evaluation and implement induction, training and/or professional development to strengthen the company‚Äôs governance practices. Through the use of the Companies Act and the Kings report the company secretary ensures directors are kept abreast of relevant legislative and regulatory developments. It was observed that the company secretary ensures good information flow between the board, directors and stakeholders and keeps record of all conflicts of interest. Though the company secretary is appointed by the board they can whistle blow any misconduct under the protection of the Protected Disclosure Act, thus ensuring effectiveness of their role. Despite the fact that some of the company secretaries are facing challenges due to the ever evolving and increasing complexity of their roles, there has been evolution with regards to legislation, greater transparency, better governance and improved investor expectation. This study enriches company secretaries with knowledge of their expected role in CG. ¬© 2015 Virtus interpress.},

abstract={In this study, we investigate the relations between CEO stock options and analysts‚Ä≤ earnings forecast accuracy and bias. We argue that a higher level of stock options may induce managers to undertake riskier projects, to change and/or reallocate their effort, and to possibly engage in gaming (such as opportunistic earnings and disclosure management) and hypothesize that these managerial behaviors will result in an increase in the complexity of forecasting and, hence, in less accurate analysts‚Ä≤ forecasts. We also posit that analysts‚Ä≤ optimistic forecast bias will increase as the level of stock options pay increases. We reason that as forecast complexity increases with stock options pay, analysts, needing greater access to management‚Ä≤s information to produce accurate forecasts, have incentives to increase the optimistic bias in their forecasts. Alternatively, a higher level of stock options pay may lead to improved disclosure because it better aligns managers‚Äô and shareholders‚Ä≤ interests. The improved disclosure, in turn, may result in more accurate and less biased analysts‚Ä≤ forecasts. Using ordinary least squares estimation, we test these hypotheses relating the level of CEO stock options pay to analysts‚Ä≤ forecast accuracy and bias on a sample of firms from the Standard & Poor‚Ä≤s ExecuComp database over the period 1993‚Äì2003. Our OLS models relate forecast accuracy and forecast bias (the dependent variables) to CEO stock options (the independent variable) and controls for earnings characteristics, firm characteristics, and forecast characteristics. We measure forecast accuracy as negative one times the absolute value of the difference between forecasted and actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price and forecast bias as forecasted minus actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price. We control for differences in earnings characteristics by including earnings volatility, whether the firm has a loss, and earnings surprise; for differences in firm characteristics by including firm size, growth (measured as book-to-market ratio, percentage change in total assets, and percentage change in annual sales), and corporate governance quality (measured as percentage of shares outstanding owned by the CEO, whether the CEO is also chairman of the board of directors, number of annual board meetings, and whether directors are awarded stock options); and for differences in forecast characteristics by including analyst following and analyst forecast dispersion. In addition, the models include controls for industry and year. We use four measures of options: new options, existing exercisable options, existing unexercisable options, and total options (sum of the previous three), all scaled by total number of shares outstanding, and estimate two models for each dependent variable, one including total options and the other including new options, existing exercisable options, and existing unexercisable options. We also use both contemporaneous as well as lagged values of options in our main tests. Our results indicate that analysts‚Ä≤ earnings forecast accuracy decreases and forecast optimism increases as the level of stock options (particularly new options and existing exercisable options) in CEO pay increases. These findings suggest that the incentive alignment effects of stock options are more than offset by the investment, effort allocation, and gaming incentives induced by stock options grants to CEOs. Given that analysts‚Ä≤ forecasts are an important source of information to capital markets, our finding of a decline in the quality of the information provided by analysts has implications for the level and variability of stock prices. It also has implications for information asymmetry and cost of capital, as well as for valuation models that rely on analysts‚Ä≤ earnings forecasts. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

abstract={Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures. ¬© 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Globalization of labour and capital markets and also development and increased use of information technology, as well as the increasing complexity of business transactions influenced the emergence of new and complex risks that companies face every day. In parallel with the growing complexity of risks the expectations for their effective management are also rising. Risk management or defining strategies to deal with risks the company is exposed to become a necessary condition and prerequisite for the achievement of company objectives. One of the most important factors that influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management process is the establishment of appropriate oversight of the process itself. Although the monitoring of the risk management process is the responsibility of the Board, recently, it has been delegated to the Audit Committee and thereby its role is becoming more important and the scope of its responsibilities and tasks is expanding. Regardless of whether is it the continental system of corporate governance, which is characterized by a two tier governance structure (with Supervisory and Management Board) or the Anglo-American system of corporate governance in which the role of the management and Supervisory Board integrates into a single Board of Directors with executive and non-executive directors, the Audit Committee is a specialized subcommittee which is being delegated with appropriate supervisory functions. The primary functions of the Audit Committee are usually associated with the internal controls and risk management, financial reporting, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the relevant issues related to the process of external and internal audit. This chapter discusses the relevant features of Audit Committees in the system of corporate governance with particular emphasis on the role of Audit Committees in the risk management process. The main research objective is to analyze the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee in enterprise risk management and relevant aspects of cooperation with other participants in the process, primarily with internal auditors, exploring at the same time their significance. This chapter summarises the current understanding of the Audit Committee role in the enterprise risk management by analyzing previously published research. Research findings show that the new rules extend the duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee on risk management. Expertise and information awareness of the Audit Committee is imposed as a necessary prerequisite of their effective functioning in this area, but the main drawback that they are attributed. In order to effectively discharge their responsibilities, Audit Committees should, along with the support of governance structures, cooperate with functions such as internal audit, which could be a significant source of information necessary for their work. ¬© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Through empirical analysis of the listed Private Company fraud, this study reveals the complexity and conflict in the listed companies of China. Based on it, we contrast on the frauds of private company and non-private company. We found that the characteristics of private company led to this fraud phenomenon. The private company fraud usually is positive correlation to stock holdings of executives and chairman of the Board. In non-private company, the Board of Directors and Board of Supervisors can restrict with the frauds. In addition, the Director's salary or Independent Directors allowance is negative correlation to the frauds. This can partly explain the complexity and conflict in overall samples. ¬©2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Banks, particularly those considered too big to fail, pose a particular governance challenge, especially for taxpayers who face an undiversifiable risk of being the final backstop of the financial system. The nexus of bank governance is the board of directors, but they have proven inadequate in controlling the riskiness of bank activities, an outcome due both of the complexity of modern banks, and because boards are uncertain about what is expected of them. Using an interdisciplinary approach from law and accounting, we propose a two-step procedure to improve bank governance. First, we give bank directors an explicit standard to assess the outcome of their actions: the Prudent Investor rule which is the requirement for trusts. Adopting the Prudent Investor rule would return to director's responsibility to control the risks of banking activities. To enforce the higher standard, we propose to use disclosure as a disciplining mechanism. We base the new disclosure regime on Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires managers to implement controls over the firm's financial reporting processes and to publicly attest to their effectiveness. This section failed to prevent the credit crisis because it was too narrowly focused. We recommend that the provision be broadened to encompass governance controls in general, and that responsibility for disclosure be placed on the bank board rather than on managers. ¬© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={According to the commerce nowadays, technology is very important to respond all business requirements effectively including policies, strategies, perceptions, and regulations. Due to these concerns, it arisen IT governance which is becoming well-known issue. IT governance has gained high attention from board of directors and top management globally in order to meet organization's strategy and achieve business goals by delivering value to the business and minimizing risks. Therefore, it is complicated for them to handle different dilemmas and concentrate on prospect projects with multidimensional benefits of organizations to improve IT infrastructure and resource flexibility by aligning with IT governance frameworks. Moreover, these frameworks support IT infrastructure and resource flexibility with business. Thus, organizations gain higher business competitiveness. It is necessity to have IT processes to support in IT governance implementation. Nonetheless, there are different IT processes with complexity which affect to IT governance frameworks. Consequently, the emerged results of successful IT governance frameworks implementation are varied. They have resulted in considerable literature on perception of IT infrastructure and resource flexibility which IT governance could be effectively implemented. This research is driven to study the factors which make IT governance frameworks operate steadily. It applies a case study approach with qualitative interpretive research methodology. This paper expressively leads to the in progress development of theoretical base for the critical success factors of successful IT governance implementation processes. Moreover, it proposes to deliver a recommendation and criterion to leaderships for complete analysis in the success of IT governance implementation.},

abstract={The board of directors is seen as the central governance instrument, promoting interaction between stakeholders and promoting high performance, organization sustainability and return to investors. The practices and strategic definitions of corporative governance are considered of great importance today for corporations, due to the size and to the complexity of their structures (like M _ Forms structures) and the different forms in which they are presented: in networks, associations, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. The aim of this article is to analyze the constitution of boards of directors, based on their attributes, and the impacts of this classification on the roles and responsibilities of the directors in Brazilian companies. For this, a quantitative survey was performed in the 300 largest companies in Brazil listed in BOVESPA - stock exchange in capital market. The results found point to a strong correlation of some attributes of the directors of the researched firms with the roles and responsibilities of the board, in relation to strategic, control, and institutional dimensions.},

abstract={A gap has emerged in the discussion of the current credit crisis. It relates to the role of corporate governance, and the board of directors in particular, in the risk management process. The existence of the gap may be explained in part by the quotidian nature of developments in the crisis, which have thus far required rapid reaction and left little time for careful retrospection. The gap will be closed as regulators and shareholders alike ficus renewed attention on the role of board supervision in the risk management processes. Regulators have traditionally set high expectations for the oversight role of the board. The complexities of large financial institutions have challenged those expectations. Shareholders too have expectations for the oversight of the board. Derivative actions will test the scope of those expectations.},

A civil money penalty is intended as more than a mere remedial action. See 12 U.S.C. ¬ß1818(i)(2)(G); http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/bulletin/98-32.txt, Interagency Policy Regarding the Assessment of Civil Money Penalties by the Federal Financial Institutions Regulatory Agencies, attached to OCC Bulletin 98-32, July 24, 1998, available at; U.S. 132, 165 (1891). The Court further observed that the directors were "entitled under law to commit the banking business, as defined, to their duly-authorized officers, but this does not absolve them from the duty of reasonable supervision, nor ought they to be permitted to be shielded from liability because of want of knowledge of wrong-doing, if that ignorance is the result ofgross inattention...."; Id at 165-166 (emphasis added); (1997) Atherton V. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, , The latter statement could be read to suggest that the standard for liability would be gross negligence rather than simple negligence. The Supreme Court in 519 U.S. 213, 220 later observed that the lower courts had interpreted the Briggs' standard over the years in differing ways; (1913) First Nat. Bank of Louisville V.

Ct; Macey, J.R., O'Hara, M., The Corporate Governance of Banks, , April 2003 FRBNY ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW 91 (arguing for a "broader, if not higher, standard of care" for bank directors.) The; Suggestion that bank directors owe a broader duty of care is meant to suggest that bank directors have fiduciary duties to depositors as well as to shareholders. The significance of this suggestion is that it would mediate between the interests of equityholders who would prefer a higher risk profile for the bank and the deposit-holders who would prefer a lower risk profile; Id. at 102. The classic articulation of directors' duties looks to the protection of shareholders' interests and only as an institution begins to approach insolvency does diat duty broaden to encompass debt-holders. For a detailed discussion of the potentially differing perspectives of protecting shareholder interests and debt-holder and depositor interests; McCoy, P.A., A political economy of the business judgment rule in banking: implications for corporate law (1996) Case W Res.

Although ¬ß1821(k) creates a federal standard of duty, as a legislative compromise it incorporates state law definitions of the relevant terms; 519 U.S. 213 (1997); Id. at 226; Id. at 227; Id; 519 U.S. at 224; Malloy, M.P., Banking Law and Regulation, , 3.46 n.l.

To approve the proposed settlemcnt the court was required to assess the strength of the claims asserted against the directors. The court concluded that there was a very low probability that upon a full trial in the action the directors would have been found to have breached their duty to monitor and supervise, based on the standard of sustained or systematic failure that the court determined was applicable; Id at 960; 911 A2d 362 (Del. 2006); Id at 365; Id. at 366; Id; (2006) Stone V. Ritter, , C.A. No. 1570-N, 2006 WL 302558, at *2 Del. Ch. Jan. 26; The Delaware rules require a plaintiff in a derivative action to allege with particularity the efforts made by the plaintiff to obtain action from the board or the reasons for not making the effort. Del. Ch. Ct. Rule 23.1 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain a similar requirement for derivative actions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1. The Delaware Supreme Court has articulated various tests for determining when a stockholder demand upon a board will be excused as futile; (1984) Aronson V. Lewis, , 473 A2d 805 overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (2000); (1993) Rales V. Blasband, , 634 A2d 927 The "demand excused" test that the plaintiff in Stone sought to meet was that there was "a substantial likelihood of liability" for the directors arising from the claim. 911 A2d at 367; (2006) Stone V. Ritter, , 2006 WL 302558, at *2 Del. Ch. Jan. 26; Stone V. Ritter, , 911 A2d at 370; Id; Id The court noted, for example, that the Federal Reserve Board cease and desist order issued in connection with the deferred prosecution agreement was the first order issued by the Federal Reserve Board requiring AmSouth to improve its antimoney laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program; id. at 366; Id at 373; Id. at 371. The court noted that according to the KPMG report, the components of AmSouth's compliance program exhibited between a low and high degree of compliance with applicable law and regulations; Id; Id. at 372 (quoting Caremark, 698 A.2d at 968); 924 A.2d 908 (Del. Ch. 2007); Id. at 935; Id Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to include in its charter a provision eliminating liability for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by a director, subject to certain exclusions. The charter provision will not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for: (i) a breach of the duty of loyalty; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) for willful or negligent violations of Delaware law provisions relating to unlawful dividends or stock redemptions; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derives any improper personal benefit. The effect of such a charter provision is to eliminate monetary liability for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty of care, which is itself subject to a gross negligence standard; Aronson, 473 A.2d at 812 n.6. Some commentators had suggested that a free-standing duty of "good faith" existed under Delaware corporate law and that an "objective" standard of good faith would restore elements of liability otherwise eliminated by exculpatory charter provisions; Eisenberg, M.A., The duty of good faith in corporate law (2006) Dd. J. Corp. L, 31, p. 1. , 22-27 In its exegesis in Stone, the Delaware Supreme Court clarified that there is no free-standing duty of good faith, but instead that good faith is an element of the fiduciary duty of care and the fiduciary duty of loyalty. It further confirmed that oversight liability under the fiduciary duty of loyalty requires conduct that is qualitatively different from and more culpable than conduct giving rise to a violation of the fiduciary duty of care, i.e., gross negligence; 911 A.2d at 369; 192 F.R.D. 111 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); In re Cendant Corp., 189 F.R.D. 117,124-25 (D.N.J. 1999) (holding that demand was excused where the complaint alleged among other things that the accounting irregularities in question were so basic that they were discovered within one day after defendant corporation began its own investigation); Id at 117; (1999) The District Court Cited Miller V. Schreyer, , 683 N.Y.S.2d 51 App. Div. for this proposition. Miller involved a derivative claim against Merrill Lynch & Co. arising from an alleged "parking scheme" between Merrill and one of its corporate clients that occurred at each year-end for five successive years. The court said that in light of such factors as the magnitude and duration of the parking scheme, the matter should have come to the attention of the senior management and that the directors should have implemented oversight procedures to disclose "a patendy improper scheme extending over a five-year period." 683 N.Y.S. 2d at 55; 239 F.3d 808 (6th Cir. 2001), amended in part, 250 F.3d 997 (6th Cir. 2001); 239 F.3d at 816; note; Id at 824; Id at 819; 325 F.3d 795 (7th Cir. 2003).

abstract={Determining an appropriate size for a board of directors remains an ongoing challenge for which existing research has provided little practical guidance. Our study attempts to redress this gap by deconstructing the complexity, both theoretically and methodologically, inherent within exploring the relationship between board size and financial performance. While previous studies examining this relationship have almost exclusively drawn upon samples comprised of large, U.S. for-profit organizations, we attempt to broaden the existing boundary conditions of current theory by developing and testing propositions within the context of a diverse set of Canadian nonprofit organizations.},

abstract={This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors in the Tunisian context. We model the composition of the board of directors as a function of alternative governance mechanisms, some board characteristics and other control variables. On a sample of 97 Tunisian firms, we find evidence that the proportion of outsiders on the board of directors is positively associated with large block, institutional and overseas ownerships, and board size. We document that the CEO duality is associated with a decrease in the board independence. We fail to find an evidence that increased debt ratio to total assets is inversely associated with the outside board representation. While we predict a positive relationship between the board independence and the firm size, the organizational complexity and the quotation status; our results generally do not support this conjecture.},

Title = {When Do Boards of Directors Contribute to Shareholder Value in Firms
   Targeted for Acquisition? A Group Information-Processing Perspective},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Abstract = {We draw on group information-processing theory to investigate how target
   boards of directors may contribute to target value capture during the
   private negotiations phase in acquisitions. We view target boards as
   information-processing groups and private negotiations as
   information-processing tasks. We argue that target board meeting
   frequency is associated with increased processing-gathering, sharing,
   and analyzing-of acquisition related information, which improves target
   bargaining and, ultimately, target value capture. We further posit that
   this value-enhancing effect of target board meeting frequency is more
   pronounced when target board composition improves the ability of target
   boards to process acquisition-related information. Finally, we expect
   that meeting frequency is more consequential for target bargaining and
   value capture when acquisition complexity imposes high
   information-processing demands on the target boards during private
   negotiations. Empirical evidence from a sample of acquisitions of
   publicly listed firms in the United States offers support for our group
   information-processing perspective on board contribution to shareholder
   value in firms targeted for acquisition.},

Title = {Gender Faultline Strength on Boards of Directors and Strategic Change:
   The Role of Environmental Conditions},
Journal = {GROUP \& ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {564-601},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Drawing on the notion of ``fault lines{''} and the upper echelons
   perspective, we argue that the gender fault line strength of a board of
   directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly,
   while gender fault line strength negatively relates to strategic change
   under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism,
   and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic
   change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and
   environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data
   of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for
   the hypotheses.},

Title = {Board of directors structure and firm financial performance: A
   qualitative comparative analysis},
Journal = {LONG RANGE PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on
   the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical
   perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression
   analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and
   configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive
   previous empirical results about the link among several board features
   and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms
   from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set
   qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm
   financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several
   board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and
   board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm
   leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics.
   Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the
   wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics
   on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds
   to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which
   circumstances different board features should contribute positively or
   negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also
   implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some
   useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate
   governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate
   governance recommendations must be rethought.},

Abstract = {Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face
   increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms
   toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about
   these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for
   independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board
   govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus
   theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing
   from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we
   offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a
   strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic
   leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and
   boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently
   and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance,
   and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by
   describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e.,
   munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of
   attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting
   the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a
   2 x 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic
   leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of
   environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental
   munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams
   and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young
   entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of
   environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change
   in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the
   negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors
   and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and
   munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the
   article.},

Abstract = {This study tests whether firms seek to mitigate the adverse effects of
   Financial Reporting Complexity (FRC) by investing in accounting
   expertise. We develop a measure of FRC based on the complexity of
   accounting standards that govern annual disclosures. We find that FRC is
   positively related to the accounting expertise on a firm's board of
   directors and audit committee. We also find that accounting expertise
   mitigates the relation between FRC and negative reporting outcomes.
   Collectively, this study increases our understanding of the actions
   firms take to mitigate the negative consequences of FRC, and the role of
   accounting expertise in this setting.},

Title = {Corporate governance in Kuwait: joining the dots between regulatory
   reform, organisational change in boards and audit committees and firm
   market and accounting performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine the link between boards and audit
   committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context
   of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform.
   Design/methodology/approachPanel data regression analysis with fixed
   effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97
   listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period.
   The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the
   debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent
   variables comprise board of directors and audit committee
   characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers
   of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm
   size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables.
   FindingsMixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board
   of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members
   positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity.
   For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and
   expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size
   and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures
   considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best
   determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implicationsData from a single
   country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily
   limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights
   into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional
   quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information,
   Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of
   good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change.
   Practical implicationsThe recent corporate governance code and
   guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit
   committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied
   most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market
   reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed
   firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social
   implicationsKuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate
   governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit
   of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to
   audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in
   the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of
   stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and
   indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm
   corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/valueSeminal
   analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly
   progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an
   initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to
   incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics.
   Reveals studies of the corporate governance-firm performance
   relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical
   significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and
   guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms

Abstract = {This study aims to examine (1) the association between the chief
   executive officer tenure and audit quality, (2) the relationship between
   chief executive officer duality and audit quality, (3) the association
   between board independence and audit quality, (4) the relationship
   between board size and audit quality, and (5) the role of controlling
   variables (client size, leverage debt, and business complexity) in
   controlling these relationships. The research sample includes 325
   financial reports from manufacturing firms listed in Amman Stock
   exchange over the 20142018 period. The study relationships are tested by
   using logistic regression. The results revealed a negative relationship,
   but not significant between CEO tenure and independent directors with
   audit quality. In addition, the results showed there is a negative
   effect of CEO duality on audit quality; also the results revealed that
   there is a statistically significant effect on the board of directors
   (board size) on the AQ. In general, the coefficient estimates of
   controlling variables show that client size and leverage debt positively
   affect audit quality, and on the contrary, business complexity has an
   insignificant positive relationship with audit quality. The summary of
   the study findings play an active role to external auditor opinion on
   business practice in towered the corporate governance system.},

Abstract = {Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information
   asymmetriesoften labeled lack of transparencybetween top managers and
   their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of
   information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level
   complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial
   reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have
   and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting
   fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and
   firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud.
   Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when
   industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit
   committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level
   complexity is high.},

Abstract = {Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global
   transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible
   citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations
   incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business
   practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in
   their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board
   of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the
   Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies
   from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region
   leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the
   institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility
   (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ.
   We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/or mission
   statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental
   organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes
   to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of
   sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid
   foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study
   identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The
   weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable
   development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted.

Abstract = {Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in
   recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments
   within alliances. We extend the ``scope of operations{''} hypothesis to
   the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the
   monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become
   more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique
   sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate
   governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on
   monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we
   adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to
   examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact
   coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size
   as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the
   black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance
   research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the
   unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the
   boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show
   there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on
   corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's
   understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in
   relation to their complexity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper analyses board size and composition determinants with
   reference to boards' two principal functions: the control or monitoring
   function and the advisory function. It also tackles the endogeneity
   problem which exists in this type of studies. Using a sample composed of
   171 publically traded Spanish corporations spanning the period
   2004-2008, the results show that, in Spain, board size is sensitive to
   advisory needs (using firm complexity as a proxy for them), while board
   composition depends to a greater extent on the need for control,
   determined by the organization's stock structure. The evidence shows
   that the presence of independent members on the boards of directors in
   Spain basically responds the objective of guaranteeing an adequate
   representation of the ownership structure of the company rather than in
   response to a specific need for counselling.},

Abstract = {Despite the considerable increase in studies on international joint
   ventures (IJVs) and family business, the two research streams have yet
   to be systemically integrated. Family firms have unique characteristics
   that affect their involvement in IJVs differently from their non-family
   counterparts. Indeed, family firms face a paradox entailing a lower
   willingness to form IJVs, but a higher ability to govern them. Drawing
   on three distinct components of strategic agility (i.e., strategic
   sensitivity, leadership unity, and resource fluidity), we develop a
   theoretical framework that unravels this paradox. Specifically, we argue
   that strong emotional attachment reduces family firms? strategic
   sensitivity, creating a motivational gap with respect to forming IJVs.
   On the other hand, when family firms overcome this gap by making full
   use of their board of directors, they have higher levels of leadership
   unity and resource fluidity. These dimensions lead to a greater ability
   to govern the complexities of the relationship, hence reducing
   opportunistic hazards, and significantly increasing the odds of the
   long-term success of IJVs. We develop propositions for empirical
   studies, and offer implications and directions for future research.},

Abstract = {In a cross-country setting, we document that busy boards of directors
   (i.e., outside directors with multiple directorships) enhance a bank's
   financing capacity by lowering its cost of debt, which is consistent
   with the signalling quality hypothesis. Our analysis further reveals
   that this negative association is more pronounced in conventional banks
   than their Islamic counterparts. Possibly owning to the distinctive
   governance structure and the complexity of the Islamic business model,
   which requires closer monitoring, Muslim debtholders might depreciate a
   busy board of directors as it is likely to associate with lower
   scrutinising effectiveness. Our results provide a positive counterpoint
   to the negative relationship that exists between busy directors and firm
   performance, and contributes to understanding the indispensable role
   busy boards play in debt financing.},

Abstract = {This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature
   about the link between board characteristics and the level of social
   responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative
   analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the
   complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the
   USA for the period 2008-2010, our findings support the four tenets of
   complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal
   asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on
   a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size,
   independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes
   (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors
   play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper
   combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social
   responsibility performance. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd

Abstract = {Despite boards of directors' prominent involvement in strategic alliance
   ( SA) decisions in practice and reports from news media, there is
   relatively little academic research exploring the board's value for a
   firm's technical SA investments involving a technical transfer or R \&
   D, which are characterized by a high level of uncertainty, information
   asymmetry, and extreme complexity. Anchored in the resource dependence
   theory, this study aims to address this important issue by examining how
   board of directors contribute their human capital, in the form of
   relevant strategic experience, may mitigate the core challenges managers
   face when pursuing technical SAs and thereby influencing their outcomes.
   Our empirical results show that when outside directors hold more
   extensive alliance experience, they can better execute their consulting
   function and improve the firm's technical alliance performance. In
   addition, directors with experience specifically related to technical
   alliances also have a positive effect on performance. Last, we find that
   the impact of alliance experience on technical alliance performance is
   positively moderated by the size of directors' prior affiliated
   companies and their share ownership in the focal firm.},

Abstract = {External stakeholders rely heavily on the information contained in the
   financial statements when making business decisions. Given the risks
   they take in making decisions based on this information, they expect the
   management to provide them with quality financial statements. In order
   to be able to provide such financial statements, the company's
   management needs to establish quality internal control over the
   financial reporting system. The task of this internal control is to
   reduce the risks of unintentional errors in accounting records, as well
   as intentional manipulation of accounting information contained in
   financial statements. Having in mind the importance of internal control
   for providing reliable financial statements, the author intends to
   identify the determinants of the quality of internal control in this
   article. In order to identify these determinants, the author relies on
   the results of empirical research conducted in countries where companies
   are required to disclose information on the quality of internal control
   over financial statements. According to the author's findings, the
   quality of internal control is influenced by a number of factors
   concerning the characteristics of corporate governance and the
   characteristics of the company in which internal control is established.
   When it comes to the characteristics of corporate governance, the
   quality of internal control over the financial reporting system is
   affected by the quality of the board of directors, the quality of the
   audit committee and the quality of internal audit. When it comes to the
   characteristics of the company, the author found that the quality of
   internal control over the financial reporting system is influenced by
   the ownership structure of the company, its size, age, financial
   stability, complexity, growth rate and the fact that the company is in
   the process of restructuring.},

Abstract = {Over four decades, research and policy have created layers of
   understandings in the quest for ``good{''} corporate governance. The
   corporate excesses of the 1970s sparked a search for market mechanisms
   and disclosure to empower shareholders. The UK-focused problems of the
   1990s prompted board-centric, structural approaches, while the fall of
   Enron and many other companies in the early 2000s heightened emphasis on
   director independence and professionalism. With the financial crisis of
   2007-09, however, came a turn in some policy approaches and in academic
   literature seeking a different way forward. This paper explores those
   four phases and the discourse each develops and then links each to
   assumptions about accountability and cognition. After the financial
   crisis came pointers n policy and practice away from narrow, rationalist
   prescriptions and toward what the philosopher Stephen Toulmin calls
   ``reasonableness{''}. Acknowledging that heightens awareness of
   complexity and interdependence in corporate governance practice. The
   paper then articulates a research agenda concerning what
   ``reasonably{''} good corporate governance might entail.},

Abstract = {This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate
   the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures
   (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of
   board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related
   to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can
   enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that
   are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the
   level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent
   research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents
   and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual
   safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g.
   trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is
   valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination
   responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing
   evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that
   shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications
   of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should
   be made with care.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to review the role of board size as part of the
   corporate governance system. This paper discusses one aspect of
   corporate governance, namely, boards, in the Indonesian context. Using
   the literature review method, this paper explores factors that need to
   be considered to determine the optimal number of boards, especially in
   Indonesia. We explore some determinants of board size, such as
   complexity and leverage, ownership structure, and financial ratio
   support. The results reveal that an understanding of the differences
   found in the two-tier board model helps us understand that the different
   functions of the board of commissioners and the board of directors
   require different test treatments from countries that adhere to one-tier
   systems. A review of the relationship between board size and company
   performance is expected to provide the corporate governance literature
   with insights into optimizing the sizes of boards that can improve
   company performance, both in terms of boards of commissioners and boards
   of directors. This paper proposes the simultaneous testing of board
   size's relationship with company performance. The results of this study
   are expected to make a more real contribution about the effect of board
   size on company performance.},

   levels of organisational complexity. In the light of an expanding civil
   society sector in Chile and the emergence of formalised governance
   practices, this paper explores the construction of the Executive
   Director role in Chilean NGOs with reference to organisational
   functions, organisational dynamics, and external influences.
   Design/methodology/approach Grounded theory is used to explore
   qualitative data derived from a set of N = 39 interviews conducted in
   Chile These interviews involve NGO founders, funders, Executive
   Directors, scholars, consultants, and team members. Findings The
   findings reveal the pivotal role played by Executive Directors in
   conducting organisational activities which, in other types of
   organisations, are often distributed across various organisational
   functions. The data also highlight complex dynamics involving overt
   compliance with external regulatory requirements, uncertainties about
   financial sustainability, the recruitment of Executive Board members,
   the exercise of power by Executive Directors, and the influence of
   founders in leadership configurations.
   Research limitations/implications - The implications of the study are
   discussed in relation to the governance and accountability of NGOs, the
   nature of the Executive Director role, the purpose of Executive Boards
   in the NGO sector, and the recruitment and training of Board members. It
   is noted that the study was conducted in the NGO sector in Chile;
   further research is necessary to establish the generalisability of the
   findings to other contexts.
   Originality/value This paper addresses the shortage of organisational
   research on NGOs. It contributes by offering analytical perspectives on
   organisational processes of Leadership and Governance. This paper
   highlights the relationship between, and interdependency of, those
   processes.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer
   (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate
   directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity
   hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact
   of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference
   (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S\&P 1500 firms from
   an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively
   correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to
   increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently
   facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically
   rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and
   statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that
   effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference
   inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically
   significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also
   disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both
   economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social
   preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these
   findings for research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {The current U.S. climate of racial and social injustice has prompted a
   renewed call for diverse and equitable ways to rethink community
   philanthropy. Community foundations are vehicles for community
   philanthropy which offer vast benefits for social improvement and
   community development. The board of directors ensures these
   organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding
   priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally
   responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative
   bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we
   suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence
   of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of
   diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs
   of certain social groups. Increased understanding of diversity can
   improve foundation and philanthropic effectiveness and bring broader
   social change by promoting equity and social justice among
   community-based philanthropic organizations.},

Title = {Integrating the board's resources to achieve a firm's
   internationalisation},
Journal = {ACADEMIA-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ADMINISTRACION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {332-358},
Abstract = {Purpose - From the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper
   is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in
   international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental
   complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve
   better performance than its competitors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper highlights the active
   participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample
   of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a
   longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010.
   Findings - The results show that while the resources provided by the
   directors through their level of education and international experience,
   help them learn and process information, and they are a source of
   expertise representing ``board potential{''}. A board that functions
   well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration
   and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive
   advantages in an international context.
   Originality/value - From a RBV, this paper refines and extends the
   concept of ``board capability{''} as the combination of potential and
   internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles
   competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the
   effect of board capability on firm internationalisation.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the complexity theory and responding to the recent calls to
   use such creative methods that mix between a quantitative and
   qualitative approach. Therefore, this study fills the literature gap,
   adding novelties, showing evidence from the unexplored (or
   underexplored) European context and, consequently, shedding light to
   inconclusive results in previous research concerning the effect of audit
   committee (AC) and board characteristics on corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) disclosure by applying a novel research
   methodology: the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. The data
   were collected from Eikon database for a sample of the top 69
   non-financial European companies (based on market capitalisation) for
   the period 2016-2018. The study results support the equifinality and
   complexity tenets of complexity theory. It also suggests that CSR
   disclosure relies on a complex configuration of some AC attributes, for
   example, independence, financial expert member, chair independence, size
   and activity, and other board characteristics (independence, gender,
   size, activity, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality). These
   characteristics play a leading part as a recipe ingredient and, in an
   appropriate combination, promote achieving high CSR disclosure levels.
   Our empirical results offer multidimensional and valuable insights for
   professionals, regulators, and policymakers in establishing and revising
   the guidelines regarding the AC and board of directors' composition.},

Abstract = {The perceived economic value of an independent boardroom configuration
   has progressively emerged as a matter of considerable importance in the
   academic and popular literature. The normative research paradigm has
   fundamentally been dominated by positivists who formulate inferential
   models populated by large sets of archival data. Regrettably, however,
   several decades of intense inquiries and passionate debates have
   invariably failed to ascertain (or dispel) the economic value of an
   independent boardroom configuration. The lingering boardroom
   independence corporate performance saga has reached an impasse with no
   clear resolution in the foreseeable future. In this study, I provide a
   diagnosis (through the thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews)
   of why the economic viability of an independent boardroom remains an
   elusive phenomenon for positivist researchers. A central reason for the
   research impasse is attributed to ontological complexities intrinsic to
   the very nature of the corporation, compounded by multiple layers of
   methodological complexities. Ultimately, the disentanglement of this
   enigma would require a pivotal reconceptualization of the corporate
   governance research agenda. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigate the extent to which the incentive alignment theory and
   the managerial power theory explain the variability of CFO compensation
   in Australia. We find a positive relationship between the level of CFO
   compensation and measures of job complexity and firm stock market
   performance. However, we do not find the pay-for-performance link when
   performance is measured at the CFO-specific level. CFOs actually receive
   higher non-cash compensation when reporting quality is lower, suggesting
   a sharp contrast to predictions of the incentive alignment approach.
   Conversely, we find that CFOs who have more managerial power (the CFO is
   on the board of directors, or holds a higher level of stock ownership,
   or stays longer in their position) receive significantly higher
   compensation. For example, a CFO who has board membership receives on
   average \$323,590 more than the total compensation of a CFO who is not a
   board insider. Overall both theories are important in determining
   Australian CEO compensation but the managerial power hypothesis explains
   a larger fraction of variation in CFO pay than the incentive alignment
   view. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age
   diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity
   and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased
   in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more
   gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is
   related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is
   associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more
   female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also
   find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm.},

Title = {Executive Board Chairs: Examining the Performance Consequences of a
   Corporate Governance Hybrid},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Traditional agency theory views the proper role of the board chair
   exclusively as providing independent oversight to monitor and control
   the CEO. Recently, firms have introduced innovations in board leadership
   that have confounded these theoretical expectations. One notable
   innovation is the executive board chair, a corporate governance hybrid
   responsible for both oversight and strategic decision-making,
   challenging agency theory's prescription that the two activities remain
   separate. In this study, we argue that an executive board chair position
   can resolve the trade-off between independent oversight and involvement
   in strategy and therefore generate a performance advantage. We also
   predict that, owing to the blurring of lines between the CEO and board
   chair roles that the executive board chair position creates, the
   relationship will be stronger the greater the need to monitor and
   control the CEO but weaker when organizational complexity and board
   leadership demands are greater. Analysis of S\&P 1500 firms from 2003 to
   2017 provides general support for our arguments.},

Abstract = {We examine the impact of cultural diversity in boards of directors on
   firm performance. We construct a measure of national cultural diversity
   by calculating the average of cultural distances between board members
   using Hofstede's culture framework. Our findings indicate that national
   cultural diversity in boards negatively affects firm performance
   measured by Tobin's Q and ROA. These results hold after controlling for
   potential endogeneity using firm fixed effects and instrumental
   variables regressions. Further, the results are robust to controlling
   for a wide range of board and firm characteristics, including various
   measures of ``foreignness{''} of the firm, alternative culture
   frameworks, and other measures of culture. The negative impact of
   cultural diversity on performance is mitigated by the complexity of the
   firm and the size of foreign sales and operations. In addition, we find
   that the negative effects of cultural diversity are concentrated among
   the independent directors. Finally, we find that not all aspects of
   cultural differences are equally important and that it is mainly the
   diversity in individualism and masculinity that affects the
   effectiveness of boards of directors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A configurational perspective of boards' attention structures},
Journal = {CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW},
Abstract = {Research Question/Issue What combinations of board attributes and
   contextual factors explain boards' selective distribution of attention
   between their dual role of resource provisioning and monitoring? At the
   board level, we consider board structure and breadth of knowledge, while
   the context in which boards operate is captured by the degree of
   external scrutiny, operational complexity, performance, and ownership
   structure. Research Findings/Insights Our study demonstrates that there
   are multiple ways board attributes bundle and combine with important
   elements of the context to promote similar board attention structures.
   Our findings provide evidence of the causal complexity underlying this
   phenomenon and corroborate the notions of equifinality and asymmetric
   causality among board-, firm-, and institution-level conditions
   conducive to boards allocating more attention to either their resource
   provisioning or monitoring roles. Theoretical/Academic Implications Our
   findings support the attention-based view (ABV), suggesting that boards'
   selective distribution of attention is regulated by the combination of
   skills and knowledge directors bring to the firm and the stimuli
   provided by contextual factors. In doing so, we underscore the need for
   an extended theory on board effectiveness, as resource dependence- and
   agency-based prescriptions about boards' behavior may be incomplete,
   since there is limited consideration by these theories of the bounded
   rationality of directors and the complex relationships between the
   factors that can frame boards' selective distribution of attention.
   Practitioner/Policy Implications Our study informs efforts to
   disentangle the conditions under which different attributes combine and
   regulate boards' distribution of attention, which has implications for
   nomination committees and powerful actors who have influence on board
   appointments. Because our results reveal several causal paths that can
   promote similar board attention structures, decision makers may wish to
   recruit directors with specific attributes that will be the best fit for
   the firm's contextual conditions.},

Title = {Environmental sustainability performance and shareholder value: an
   international fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis},
Journal = {EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS},
Abstract = {PurposeConsidering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices'
   variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies
   on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of
   environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on
   shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors
   (BoD hereinafter), firm and country
   characteristics.Design/methodology/approachThe author used the Thomson
   Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder
   Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author
   applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter)
   to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and
   Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period
   2016-2020.FindingsThe author found a positive association between ESP
   and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between
   Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of
   this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil
   law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is
   widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal
   predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American
   peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification
   strategies.Practical implicationsThis study assists researchers,
   practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that
   BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly
   playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value
   relationship.Originality/valueThe author's study offers a more
   encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key
   drivers and outcomes of ESP.},

Abstract = {In recent years a growing interest in gender diversity has arisen in the
   business context, and a significant number of research studies have
   analysed its effect on corporate performance. Nonetheless, these studies
   have not led to conclusive results, perhaps owing to the complexity of
   the relationship. The present work focuses on analysing two possible
   justifications of the contradictory effects of gender diversity on
   company performance: the business context and the optimum size of the
   female presence in decision-making bodies. The results obtained show
   that when working conditions and academic background are similar, women
   achieve better performance in sectors traditionally dominated by men.
   Moreover, to take the best advantage of gender diversity it is
   recommended that boards of directors should be balanced or have a
   slightly higher female presence.},

Abstract = {This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of
   organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing
   the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively
   influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year
   observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012,
   our results indicate that the association between firm performance and
   top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness
   of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is
   associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more
   effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.},

Title = {The Role of Female Directors in the Boardroom: Examining Their Impact on
   Competitive Dynamics},

Abstract = {This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members
   and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research
   questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's
   competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more
   pronounced? Leveraging the ``Awareness-Motivation-Capability{''} (AMC)
   framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should
   impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's
   competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms
   for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the
   board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's
   competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of
   competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates
   these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased
   volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female
   board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic
   direction of the firm.},

Title = {A review of derivatives research in accounting and suggestions for
   future work},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING LITERATURE},

Abstract = {This paper provides a review of research on financial derivatives, with
   an emphasis on and comprehensive coverage of research published in 15
   top accounting journals from 1996 to 2017. We begin with some brief
   institutional details about derivatives and then summarize studies
   explaining when and why firms use derivatives. We then discuss the
   evolution of the accounting rules related to derivatives (and associated
   disclosure requirements) and studies that examine changes in these
   requirements over the years. Next, we review the literature that
   examines the consequences of firms' derivative use to various capital
   market participants (i. e., managers, analysts, investors, boards of
   directors, etc.), with an emphasis on the role that the accounting and
   disclosure rules play in such consequences. Finally, we discuss the
   importance of industry affiliation on firms' derivative use and the role
   that industry affiliation plays in derivatives research. Overall, our
   review suggests that, perhaps due to their inherent complexity and data
   limitations, derivatives are relatively understudied in accounting, and
   we highlight several areas where future research is needed.},

Abstract = {Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their
   boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director
   social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social
   capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex
   firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more
   attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and
   exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms
   with high-status directors on their current boards will be more
   attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social
   capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms
   between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the
   hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors
   with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated
   with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the
   status of current board members is associated with the ability to add
   new directors who also have high status.},

Abstract = {This paper extends prior research on the relationship between governance
   quality and auditor remuneration. We examine the influence of audit
   committee effectiveness (ACE), a proxy for governance quality, on audit
   fees (AF) and non-audit services fees (NASF) using a new composite
   measure comprising audit committee independence, expertise, diligence
   and size. We find that after controlling for board of director
   characteristics, there is a significant positive association between ACE
   and AF only for larger clients. Our results indicate that effective
   audit committees undertake more monitoring which results in wider audit
   scope and higher audit fees. Contrary to our expectations, we find the
   association between ACE and NASF to be positive and significant,
   especially for larger clients. This suggests that larger clients are
   more likely to purchase non-audit services (NAS) even in the presence of
   effective audit committees probably due to the complexity of their
   activities. Overall, our findings support regulatory initiatives aimed
   at improving corporate governance quality.},

Abstract = {Credit unions compete directly with commercial banks in markets for
   consumer financial services yet receive an exemption from federal
   corporate income tax. Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no
   different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents
   an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they
   offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks
   in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit,
   cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences
   in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit
   unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant
   principal-agent literature, we provide several arguments to support the
   hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered
   incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized
   commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that
   credit union CEOs receive approximately 250\% less performance-based
   compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank
   CEOs also earn approximately 15\% to 20\% more total compensation on
   average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and
   board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and
   institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and
   risk. The findings suggest important differences in incentive structures
   and objectives between banks and credit unions.},

Abstract = {Governance research in the arts has focused predominantly on boards of
   directors and organizational dynamics. By incorporating a wider view of
   governance as a process involving multiple actors and a concern for
   public benefits, this multi-level study connects the roles of arts
   organizations in collaborative cultural governance processes. By using
   an integrative framework for collaborative governance, the study derives
   data from case studies of two arts initiatives in Korea: Homeless Ballet
   Education and the Ecomuseum project on Daebu Island. The findings
   highlight the leadership behaviours of arts organizations and indicate
   key actors in the collaborative cultural governance. Autonomy, artistry
   and mutuality are found to meet the conditions under which arts
   organizations are likely to be lead organizations. However,
   collaborative governance calls for differing leadership roles, depending
   on the type of arts organization. This study not only makes a
   contribution regarding the under-researched link between arts
   organizations and collaborative governance but also provides insights
   into the role of arts and culture leadership in a complex social issue.},

Abstract = {The historical evolution of corporate governance is considered,
   highlighting the different eras of governance, the dominant theoretical
   and practical paradigms, the reformulation of paradigms and counter
   paradigms. Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one
   collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other
   individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value)
   are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team
   production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of
   business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors)
   securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The
   potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and
   directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company
   Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of
   corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon
   short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder
   value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are
   explored. Finally, the imperative of the advance of sustainable
   enterprise is argued, and the critical changes necessitated in corporate
   purpose and directors' duties.},

Abstract = {Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a
   consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research.
   Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to
   comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring
   factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They
   find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions,
   whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current
   structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships
   operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the
   framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer
   intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as
   a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions.
   Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational
   relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors,
   has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm
   performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of
   interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time.
   We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an
   expanded data set coveringmore than 20 years. Over this broader time
   horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing
   firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current
   relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to
   diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate
   the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a
   more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding
   interorganizational relationships. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {466-493},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and critique prior
   research on audit committees using a practice-theory lens. Research on
   audit committees has followed the same trajectory as early research on
   boards of directors, which has been criticised for its singular
   theoretical perspectives and methodologies that do not capture the
   complexity of real-world experiences/behaviours.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors devise an analytical framework
   based on practice theory to conduct the review. The authors examine what
   audit committees should do (i.e. best practice) vs what audit committees
   actually do (i.e. actual activities in practice - praxis). Attributes of
   audit committee members, and the relationship dynamics relevant to their
   role execution (i.e. practitioners), are considered.
   Findings - Research on boards has found that over-emphasis on agency
   theory's monitoring role negatively impacts boards' effectiveness. The
   authors invoke other theories in examining what audit committees do in
   practice. The authors characterise the role of audit committees as
   oversight not monitoring. The authors question whether, similar to
   auditing, audit committees are blamist tools or are genuinely orientated
   towards supporting improvements in organisational management systems.
   The authors unpack the ritualistic ceremonial behaviours and symbolic
   endeavours vs substantive engagement by audit committees. The analytical
   framework also considers the ``guardianship circle{''} around audit
   committees in the form of the key practitioners and their relationships:
   audit committee members, auditors and managers.
   Originality/value - Drawing on the analytical framework, the authors
   provide directions for further opportunities for research of audit
   committees.},

Title = {Pension discount rate, executive stock-based compensation and investor
   sentiment},
Journal = {MANAGERIAL FINANCE},
Abstract = {PurposeIn this paper, the impact of stock-based compensation and further
   the joint effects of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment on
   pension discount rate choice is examined.Design/methodology/approachThe
   hypotheses is tested using fixed effects models and instrumental
   variable analysis where pension discount rate is the dependent variable,
   and stock-based compensation and investor sentiment are our variables of
   interest.FindingsIt was found that pension discount rate is negatively
   associated with managers' stock-based compensation. Further analysis
   indicates that managers with larger stock-based compensation tend to
   adjust down their pension discount rates in higher (smaller) degree,
   responding to high (low) investor sentiment.Practical implicationsThe
   findings provide important insights into how managers use pension
   discount rates to engage in earnings management. Understanding these
   relationships has implications for interpreting pension numbers reported
   in the financial statements and designing pension accounting rules that
   minimize the possibility that managers take advantage of the complexity
   associated with pension accounting to influence the reported earnings
   and executive compensation. Moreover, the findings suggest the need for
   increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to
   reported pension liabilities and service costs, especially for firms
   paying higher proportion of stock-based compensation to managers and
   during periods of high investor sentiment.Originality/valueThe findings
   contribute to the extant literature by identifying the joint impacts of
   stock-based compensation and investor sentiment as incentives for
   pension discount rate manipulation. The empirical results of this study
   also have important implications for corporate governance and
   regulation.},

   Project},
Journal = {INTERFACES},

Abstract = {BHP plans to enter the bulk fertilizer market by developing its first
   potash operation, the Jansen Potash Mine, in Saskatchewan, Canada. In
   conjunction with Amec Foster Wheeler, the Jansen project team developed
   a model of the Jansen production and logistics chain to understand the
   drivers of production capacity. The Detailed Integrated Capacity
   Estimate model (DICE) is a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model
   of Jansen's upstream production (mining, hoisting, and ore processing)
   and downstream logistics (rail, port, and marketing). DICE provides an
   unprecedented combination of complexity, granularity, and scalability,
   which informs ore storage capacities, product sizing infrastructure,
   critical-equipment redundancies, bypasses, and operational practices.
   The team used DICE during the prefeasibility study of the Jansen
   project. The model provided the justification for the removal of about
   \$300 million in capital expenses to equip the second of two hoisting
   shafts, the reduction of planned maintenance, and the increase of the
   degree of mining automation. Throughout the prefeasibility study,
   Jansen's annual production in stage 1 of operations was estimated to
   increase by 15-20 percent, with two-thirds of this gain credited to
   DICE. This potential additional production added \$500 million to the
   net present value of Jansen stage 1. In consideration of this, among
   other factors, the BHP board of directors approved the transition of the
   Jansen project from a prefeasibility to a feasibility study.},

Title = {THE SEVERANCE PAY IN BRAZIL: AN ANALYSIS OF THE HRT CASE},
Journal = {REVISTA DIREITO GV},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Severance packages are granted to senior executives to mitigate
   management prob-lems, such as risk aversion. When the incentive plan
   stipulates the acquisition of con-trol as a hypothesis for triggering
   the indemnity, the benefit takes the form of a golden parachute and
   works as a defensive measure against hostile acquisitions by increas-ing
   the cost of the operation for the acquirer. It is understood that the
   evaluation of the board of directors performance in the executive pay
   approval must be based on the convenience of the instrument for social
   interest, which requires an institutional analysis. Both the ownership
   structure and the market for corporate control are rel-evant elements to
   determine if the incentive seeks to fulfill the purpose for which it is
   being planned, especially when the threat of hostile acquisitions is
   used as a justifica-tion for implementation. Therefore, based on the HRT
   Case, the severance pay is ana-lyzed in observance of the Brazilian
   capital market characteristics. Although it does not represent all the
   complexity of the issue, the case chosen is a portrait of a specific
   reality and offers important thoughts for an efficient regulation of
   executive pay in Brazil. This work intends to demonstrate that Comissao
   de Valores Mobiliarios {[}CVM] took into account purely theoretical
   benefits of the severance pay and did not incorpo-rate the brazilian
   stock market specificities in the analysis, a decision that brought
   losses to HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S/A shareholders.},

Abstract = {Purpose The paper aims to investigate how the governance practices of
   public-sector entities (PSEs) in Tanzania are shaped by competing
   institutional logics and strategies used to manage the logics.
   Design/methodology/approach In the paper, empirical evidence was
   gathered through documentary sources, non-participant observations and
   in-depth interviews with members of boards of directors (BoDs), chief
   executive officers (CEOs), internal and external auditors, senior
   executives and ministry officials. The data were analyzed using thematic
   and pattern-matching approaches. Findings The paper shows that
   bureaucratic and market logics co-exist and variations in governance
   practices within and across categories of PSEs. These are reflected in
   CEO appointments, multiple roles of CEOs, board member appointments,
   board composition, multiple board membership, board roles and evaluation
   of board performance. External audits also foster market logic in
   governance practices. The two competing logics are managed by actors
   through selective coupling, compromise, decoupling and
   compartmentalization. Despite competing logics, the bureaucratic logic
   remains dominant and is largely responsible for variations between the
   underlying logics and governance practices. Practical implications The
   findings suggest that public-sector reforms in emerging economies (EEs)
   must account for the fact that governance practices in PSEs are shaped
   by different institutional logics embedded in socioeconomic, political
   and organizational contexts and their corresponding management
   strategies. Originality/value Few previous studies explicitly report
   relationships between institutional logics and the governance practices
   of PSEs in EEs. The current study is one of few empirical studies to
   connect competing institutional logics and the associated management
   strategies, as well as governance practices in EEs in the context of
   public-sector reforms.},

Abstract = {Chief executive officers (CEOs) compensation is now a day's considered a
   highly debatable topic among academics and practitioners both. An
   extensive literature exits, that has examined multiple factors affecting
   the level of chief executive's remuneration. CEO is the most influential
   employee of an organization, who has the ability to create or
   deteriorate the company's value. To avoid the problem of agency cost,
   the most important task that a firm can do is to take into consideration
   the CEO's performance. It is the responsibility of the board of
   directors to oversee the CEO's performance, because better control by
   the board in the form of governance and an appropriate pay package for
   the CEO, can motivate the CEO to perform in the best interest of the
   shareholders and improve overall performance of the company. The
   decision made by the board regarding the CEO's compensation, can affect
   the performance of the firm either in the favour of the shareholder in
   form of more profit or it might lead to a loss situation for
   shareholders when a CEO gets compensated without keeping performance
   into consideration.
   Understanding the complexity associated with CEO's remuneration, this
   paper is an extension of author's previous study, and is an attempt to
   highlight a developing country's perspective by identifying the
   mediating effect of the performance, bank size along with understanding
   the moderating effect of governance mechanisms on CEO's remuneration.
   Pakistan's Banking Sector represents a definite case of very high
   salaries and compensation packages, especially for the top level staff
   such as CEO and the directors.
   This paper uses panel data of 22 listed banks in Pakistan for the period
   2006-2013 and explores the model that best explains the relationship
   between CEO compensation and following variables: Firm Performance, Firm
   Size, CEO tenure, and Governance Mechanism.},

Title = {THE POLITICS OF SHAREHOLDER VOTING},
Journal = {NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1761-1813},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Economic theory that suggests underperforming boards of directors should
   be fearful of an ouster vote by shareholders underappreciates the
   complexity of shareholder voting decisions. Skill at enhancing firm
   value has less to do with whether directors win votes and stay at the
   helm of public companies than previous commentators have presumed.
   Instead, like incumbent politicians, managers of some of the largest U.
   S. firms tend to stay in charge of firms because they understand-and
   take advantage of the political dynamics of corporate voting. This
   Article presents a competing theory of shareholder voting decisions, one
   that suggests that shareholder voting in corporate elections is not
   dissimilar from citizen voting in political elections. Next, the Article
   presents the evidence. Using a hand-collected dataset from recent board
   elections, the Article compares the explanatory power of a standard
   economic variable (long-term stock price returns) and a political
   variable (money budgeted for campaigning) on election outcomes. Based on
   the data, directors' ability to enhance firm value (as measured by stock
   price returns) is not significantly related to whether they win
   reelection. Rather, the likelihood of being returned to office appears
   to be a function of typical election politics-how much was spent by
   challengers to persuade shareholder voters. These findings have at least
   two implications. First, the theory that shareholder voting may be
   politicized helps point the way to how the SEC ought to craft
   reforms-and, just as important, how not to craft them. Recent SEC reform
   efforts have the laudable goals of creating new conduits for
   shareholders to participate in firm affairs, increasing
   shareholder-nominated candidate success, and disciplining incumbent
   managers. The results of this study suggest that these reforms will not
   achieve the stated goals. Even with these reforms, the board continues
   to have an important political advantage, which likely translates into
   real votes. As the research here shows, the outcome of elections depends
   on persuasion and, not simply, as the SEC contends, on shareholders'
   director nominees being presented alongside those of management. Second,
   the evidence and theory about shareholder voting presented here has
   significant implications for understanding mergers and acquisitions,
   particularly hostile acquisitions. The theory is that acquirers have
   steep incentives to target firms with poor performance. In most cases,
   however, such acquisitions depend on winning a vote from shareholders.
   Thus, if there is any disciplinary effect created by the prospect of
   takeovers, it depends crucially on understanding what motivates
   shareholder voting behavior. If voting shareholders respond to political
   motivations, not economic ones, then the performance of target board
   members might not be as relevant as takeover theorists had previously
   surmised.},

Abstract = {The complexity of the business world and current business models has
   motivated an increasing number of companies to disclose corporate
   information through sustainability reports. This reporting and
   stakeholders engagement may bring shared value to business and society
   in general although working towards sustainable development goals. This
   work adopts a new analytical approach by determining the global
   reporting initiative indicators related to labour practices and decent
   work, human rights, society, and product responsibility that are
   reported less frequently by companies. The final objective is to predict
   the influence that society's cultural values will play as a normative
   institutional pressure in their evolution. The results obtained for a
   sample comprising the 201 largest international companies that report in
   accordance with the recommendations of the G4 Guide in 2015 indicate
   that more than 50\% of these large companies do not report specific
   mechanisms implemented to avoid violations of human rights and labour
   rights, or information on incidents related to production and commercial
   relations. Regulatory pressures associated with cultural values have
   limited effectiveness as drivers of greater corporate transparency in
   this area, as they are able to predict a favourable evolution for only
   40\% of companies that currently do not report.},
