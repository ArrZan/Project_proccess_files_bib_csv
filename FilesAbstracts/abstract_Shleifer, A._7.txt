This article analyzes the role of top management as a key resource in obtaining sustained, competitive advantage for thefirm. The nature of managerial skills is examined and linked to isolating mechanisms and firm rents. The article aims to refocus attention on the importance of managerial expertise as a rent-generating firm resource and implies greater alignment of top management-shareholder interests than in many applications of agency theory to the firm.

This paper reviews the evidence on takeover waves of the 1960s and 1980s, and discusses the implications of this evidence for corporate strategy, agency theory, capital market efficiency, and antitrust policy. We conclude that antitrust policy played an important role in the two takeover waves, and that the wave of the ';60s presents a problem for efficient capital markets.

Equity financing is the optimal strategy for innovating firms, which can use their financial structure as a signalling device to attract outside investors. This situation is likely to arise when the firm undertakes a specific purpose R&D project aimed at developing a certain product innovation. Typically, innovations of this kind draw on the firm's cumulative, idiosyncratic knowledge base and, accordingly, the innovation process involves an high degree of asset specificity. Under such circumstances, the terms of debt financing will be adjusted adversely, and equity financing will represent the most economically efficient solution. These arguments are developed in standard static principal-agent models dealing with New Technology Based Firms and publicly held large firms undertaking an aggressive R&D strategy. In the case of NTBFs, two kinds of optimal venture capital contracts are considered, which render the sharing rules independent (a) of the agent's action and (b) of both the agent's action and the specific assets involved in the transaction. Regarding innovating large firms, it is argued that in this case, too, equity represents the optimal financing strategy, and that top executives use their equity share to signal the firm's expected return stream and value to outside investors.

Agency theory recognizes that the interests of managers and shareholders may conflict and that, left on their own, managers may make major financial policy decisions, such as the choice of a capital structure, that are suboptimal from the shareholders' standpoint. The theory also suggests, however, that compensation contracts, managerial equity investment, and monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders can reduce conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders. This research investigates the relationship between the firm's capital structure and 1) executive incentive plans, 2) managerial equity investment, and 3) monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders. This paper finds a positive relationship between the firm's leverage ratio and 1) percentage of executives' total compensation in incentive plans, 2) percentage of equity owned by managers, 3) percentage of investment bankers on the board of directors, and 4) percentage of equity owned by large individual investors. These findings are consistent with the predictions of agency theory, suggesting, in turn, that capital structure models that ignore agency costs are incomplete. (c) 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper deals with the impact of debt on R&D intensity for firms undergoing a leveraged buyout (LBO). We develop seven hypotheses based on capital market imperfection theories and agency theory. To test these hypotheses, we compare 72 R&D performing LBOs with 3329 non-LBO control observations and 126 LBOs with little or no R&D expenditures. The regressions yield four statistically significant major findings. First, pre-LBO R&D intensity is roughly one-half of the overall manufacturing mean and two-thirds of the firm's industry mean. Second, LBOs cause R&D intensity to drop by 40 percent. Third, large firms tend to have smaller LBO-related declines in R&D intensity. Fourth, R&D intensive LBOs outperform both their non-LBO industry peers and other LBOs without R&D expenditures. Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research on the determinants and effects of various governance mechanisms typically assumes that these mechanisms operate independently. However, since a variety of mechanisms are used to achieve alignment of the interests of shareholders and managers, we propose that the level of a particular mechanism should be influenced by the levels of other mechanisms which simultaneously operate in the firm. We examine the substitution effects between alternative internal governance mechanisms for a sample of 81 bank holding companies in the postderegulation period. Specifically, we consider the relationship between monitoring by outside directors and the following mechanisms: monitoring by large outside shareholders, mutual monitoring by inside directors, and incentive effects of shareholdings by managers. Our results provide evidence consistent with the substitution hypothesis. We examine the implications of our findings for future research in the area of corporate governance.

This study examines the interrelation between board composition and variables that capture various agency and financial dimensions of the firm. The agency literature suggests that outside directors on the board provide important monitoring functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conflicts between management and shareholders. The agency literature indicates that other mechanisms such as managerial equity ownership, dividend payments, and debt leverage also serve as important devices in reducing agency conflicts in firms. This study argues and documents that an inverse relationship exists between the proportion of external members on the board and managerial stock ownership, dividend payout, and debt leverage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that individual firms choose an optimal board composition depending upon alternative mechanisms employed by the firm to control agency conflicts. Board composition is also found to be systematically related to a number of other variables including institutional holdings, growth, volatility, and CEO tenure.

We examine how ownership configuration affects the determination of CEO pay raises. Based on a sample of 188 firms over a 5-year period, it was found that pay raises were based on distinctly different factors, depending on the ownership profile of the firm. In management-controlled firms--where no single major owner exists--results suggest an overarching pay philosophy: maximize CEO pay, subject to demonstration of face legitimacy of that pay. In externally-controlled firms--where a major (nonmanager) owner exists--results suggest a very different philosophy: minimize CEO pay, subject to the ability to attract/retain a satisfactory CEO.

This study tests the effects of ownership concentration, outside director equity holdings, and corporate strategy on, and the Performance implications of, the size and relatedness of units sold by parent firms. The study is based on a model that integrates agency and resource-based theories, and a sample of sell-offs by 112 Fortune 500 firms. Ownership concentration is found to be associated positively with the sale of unrelated and small units. This relationship is strengthened when outside director equity is high. In addition, the effects of corporate strategy types on the characteristics of units sold depend on ownership concentration and outside director equity. Finally, post'sell-off performance of the parent firm is associated negatively with the relatedness of the unit sold. These results suggest that the type of unit sold depends on the type of economic benefit sought by the parent firm. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper provides an empirical examination of the impact of the corporation tax and agency costs on firms' capital structure decisions. Our evidence suggests that the agency costs are the main determinants of corporate borrowing. Consistent with the agency theory, we find that firms that have fewer growth options have more debt in their capital structure. Moreover, our results show that debt mitigates the free cash flow problem and that firms that are more likely to be diversified and less prone to bankruptcy are highly geared. the negative effect of insider shareholding on leverage disappears, however; when all the agency mechanisms are accounted for. In addition, we find that, in the long run, companies that are tax exhausted exhibit significantly lower debt ratios than tax-paying firms. However, in the short run, firms' capital structure decisions are not affected by taxation. Copyright (c) 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

This study addresses the question of whether directors of publicly listed companies engage in self-serving behaviour. Specifically, the enquiry considers whether directors in failing firms reduce personal shareholdings in their firms as failure approaches. The answer not only has implications for shareholders and regulators but has importance in terms of agency theory. While it appears that directors of failed firms do not hold fewer shares or reduce their shareholdings in their own firms, it seems that they do not increase their shareholdings as frequently as those in non-failed firms.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

Executive compensation has recently become the subject of extensive scrutiny by the popular press. However, compensation for corporate directors is one area which has only received little attention or research. The present study combined resource dependence and agency theories with previous research on executive salaries to develop an explanatory model of director compensation. Data were collected from US firms at two points in time to assess the stability of these predictors. Four variables were found to have a significant relationship with director compensation: firm size, firm profitability, equity ownership by directors, and resource richness of the board. However, the explanatory power of these variables appear to decline over time. Practical implications of these results are discussed.

Among the various stakeholders of a firm, senior managers are the most likely targets for private and public political pressures. Other stakeholder groups are less visible and may be perceived as less influential in corporate strategy formulation and implementation. In some situations, consequently, senior executives may adopt corporate strategies in response to political pressures even if these strategies may be costly to shareholders. In this study, a special case is examined: the effect of divestment of South African business units on firm value. Using data from 1984 through 1990, we examine the impact that announcements of divestments have upon the stock return behavior of publicly traded firms. Our results indicate that significant and negative excess returns accrue to shares of companies announcing divestments of South African operations. These results are supportive of the premise that noneconomic pressures may influence managerial strategies rather than value-enhancement goals.

This study examines the performance implications of the fit between strategic orientations and incentive plan characteristics. Research hypotheses are based on a framework that draws upon managerial discretion and agency theories to identify the links between firm strategy, managerial motivation and control, managerial risk-bearing, and incentive plan characteristics. A pooled cross-sectional, time series research design is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 50 electric utility firms. Consistent with theory, results indicate that annual bonus plans that use cash incentives and accounting measures of performance lead to better performance among firms with Defender strategic orientations. In contrast, firms with Prospector strategic orientations realize performance benefits when they adopt stock-based incentive plans and use market measures to evaluate managerial performance.

Downsizing and layoffs are an important mechanism for U.S. firms to cope with their strategic and economic environment. In contrast, the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment limits the ability affirms to employ layoffs as a strategic measure, relegating its use to conditions of financial distress. This paper provides the first comparison of layoffs in Japan and the United States and examines stock price reactions to layoff announcements in each country from 1990 to 1994. Agency theory and Aoki's cooperative game theory are employed to discuss differences in the governance structures of U.S. and Japanese firms and their implication for stock price reactions. Results show that layoff announcements trigger negative returns for both U.S. and Japanese firms. Specifically, layoff announcements of U.S. firms are associated with a negative 1.78 percent abnormal return, while layoff announcements for Japanese firms are associated with a negative 0.56 percent abnormal return. To better understand the impact of layoffs, this study examines the relationships between stock price reactions and various layoff characteristics (such as whether the layoff is proactive or reactive or whether the layoff is the first in the industry). Implications of the findings are discussed. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recent studies have examined the determinants of international joint venture (IJV) formations and stock market reactions to such investments. Less is known, however, about the evolution of IJVs and the attendant performance implications for parent firms. This paper examines one specific type of IJV evolution, IJV internalization, whereby one firm acquires the IJV by buying out its partners). Standard agency theory variables are hypothesized to influence parent firm valuation effects. The results indicate that parent firm valuation effects are positively related to the parent firm equity owned by insiders and the interaction of debt financing and free cash flow.

This paper discusses a model that combines internal and external control mechanisms in a firm in which assets can have alternative uses that are in some states more profitable than the current one. However, restructuring a firm in order to realize the gains from alternative uses affects managers adversely since they invest in firm-specific human capital. Managers can be motivated to restructure the firm through their compensation scheme. Alternatively, investors can acquire costly information on the firm and interfere with managers' decisions. The main focus is on independent directors, who review and monitor contracts and managers' compensation. If information is not too costly, directors are the optimal institution to check managerial discretion and the degree of managerial entrenchment depends on the compensation of independent directors. However, if directors fail to exercise control over management properly, takeovers or creditor control become second-best solutions. If information is costly to transfer, unchecked managerial control may be optimal.

This paper's empirical results indicate that the average effect of antitakeover provisions on subsequent long-term investment is negative. The interpretation of these results depends on whether one thinks that there was too much, too little, or just the right amount of long-term investment prior to the antitakeover provision adoption. We use agency theory to devise more refined empirical tests of the effects of antitakeover provision adoption by managers in firms with different incentive and monitoring structures. Governance variables (e.g. percentage of outsiders on corporate boards, and separate CEO/chairperson positions) have an insignificant impact on subsequent long-term investment behavior. However, consistent with agency theory predictions, managers in firms with better economic incentives (higher insider ownership) tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less incentive alignment. Furthermore, managers in firms with greater external monitoring (due to higher institutional ownership) also tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less external monitoring. Thus, the decrease in subsequent long-term investment is significantly less for firms where the managers have greater incentives to act in shareholders' interests. Finally, there are interesting effects of the control variables. First, high book equity/market equity firms cut total long-term investment more. Second, firms that were takeover targets or rumored to be takeover targets cut long-term investment more. These results suggest that inefficient firms cut long-term investment more when an antitakeover provision is adopted. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The American corporate sector saw major reform movements during the 1980s. Despite frequent admixture in practice, two key movements can be singled out as analytically distinct: financial restructuring (generally debt-financed, often involving mergers), and total quality management (a particular approach to productive restructuring). Unfortunately the precepts and practices of these movements often clashed. This paper examines these tensions and explores them by reference to economic theories of the firm associated with each movement. While financial restructuring has been interpreted through the lens of neoclassical agency theory, total quality management has strong links with alternative approaches that can be grouped under the heading 'capabilities theory'.

Amihud and Lev (1981) are widely cited as providing evidence that managers, unless closely monitored by large block shareholders, will attempt to reduce their employment risk through unrelated mergers and diversification. These corporate strategies, however, may not be in shareholders' interests. Reconsidering the agency assumptions underlying Amihud and Lev's study and the methodology they used, we develop hypotheses regarding the association between ownership structure, board vigilance, corporate strategy, and corporate performance from management theory and test them using Amihud and Lev's data from the 1960s and new data from the 1980s. Neither study supports the conclusions of Amihud and Lev, nor the agency theory belief that monitoring efforts by principals affect the strategic behaviors of agents or the performance of firms that they manage.

The results of this research demonstrate that boards of directors in venture-capital backed companies are more involved in both strategy formation and evaluation than are boards where members do not have large ownership stakes. These same results are demonstrated even when industry, board size, level of diversification, and insider board representation are held constant. Agency theory and institutional theory are advanced as reasons for this higher level of involvement. Venture capitalists are generally seen as value-added investors who have played a significant role in the development of many entrepreneurial businesses (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This success has lead students of industrial competitiveness like Thurow (1992) to argue that the venture capitalist should serve as an example for directors of all types of organizations. One of the most significant value-added activities of the venture capitalist is involvement with strategy (Fried and Hisrich 1995; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Sapienza 1989, Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, and Taylor 1993). Implicit in the writings extolling directors who act like venture capitalists (Porter 1992a, 1992b; Bhide 1994; Thurow 1992) is the belief that they will be more active than traditional board members. However, little empirical work has been done to directly compare the level of strategic involvement of the two types of boards. Building on the work of Judge and Zeithaml (1992), this study compares the level of board involvement with strategy by the boards of venture capital-backed companies with the boards of other types of organizations. After establishing different levels of involvement, it then examines why there is a difference. Finally, this study provides additional empirical evidence on the relationship between board involvement and performance (Zahra and Pearce 1989). (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper considers some developments within Russian privatized industrial firms 1992-94 through the lens of Stakeholder-Agency Theory (SAT). Although it has its own shortcomings and weaknesses, SAT, unlike the traditional financial version of Agency Theory, at least contemplates the possibility of a transitional period during which enterprise governance structures can evolve. It is by now widely recognised that in the middle of deep economic crisis, the Russian economy is too volatile for longitudinal studies of formally structured samples of firms over a period of time. In any case, SAT is at a stage of development that has not yet yielded detailed predictions for scientific testing. Yet surveys of recently privatized firms in Russia do provide empirical data away from the origins of SAT, and it is argued that this fresh data suggests new research propositions that can hopefully lead to more theoretical refinement and ultimately testing. At the very least, SAT can be used as a heuristic device, capable of providing a way of looking at complex Russian developments in a structured way. A process of Russian privatization through management - employee buy-outs involving giveaway distributions of shares has secured the compliance of the two main groups of enterprise stakeholders who could have prevented the withdrawal of the State from the governance of industrial enterprises, but has not yet produced a form of corporate governance structure that is likely to survive in the long term without State protection. In the longer term, international competitiveness can only be secured in Russia through investment in new products and processes, and the inadequacies of managers and other employees as sources of investable funds mean that incumbents must generate a more welcoming climate for outside investors. Even after such a short period since privatization and in the middle of a deep economic crisis, some enterprises are already favouring more efficient governance structures in a way consistent with SAT.

This paper examines variations in executive pay as a function of CEO power. We assume that CEOs optimize their pay conditional upon their ability to shape decisions that favour their interests. Power is inferred from overt manifestations such as share holdings, but also from covert sources such as a CEOs' social capital. Two components of compensation are considered: base pay and bonus. While financial performance, firm size, and other factors are held constant, the results show overt power as measured by CEO, and CEO-family equity holdings, to have a curvilinear relationship with executive compensation. Proxies of covert power include tenure, being (one of) the founder(s), and firm diversification. These variables magnify or moderate the effect of equity holdings on compensation. The power effects are most pronounced for the size of CEO bonus.

This paper uses a nonlinear simultaneous equation methodology to examine how managerial ownership relates to risk taking, debt policy, and dividend policy. The results have implications for our understanding of agency costs. We find risk to be a significant and positive determinant of the level of managerial ownership while managerial ownership is also a significant and positive determinant of the level of risk. The result supports the argument that managerial ownership helps to resolve the agency conflicts between external stockholders and managers but at the expense of exacerbating the agency conflict between stockholders and bondholders. We further observe evidence of substitution-monitoring effects between managerial ownership and debt policy, between managerial ownership and dividend policy, and between managerial ownership and institutional ownership.

International retailers are increasingly using franchising as a means of entering foreign markets. However, international retail franchising lacks a conceptual basis from which an explanation of the major elements of this activity can be generated. Agency theory and its major premises of information asymmetry, monitoring costs, moral hazard and opportunism, are introduced in an attempt to provide an initial effort at bridging this conceptual gap. The paper reviews international retailing and franchise research before explaining agency theory. A discussion follows on how agency theory can explain major elements of international franchise activity of retail firms such as the international retail franchise process and the operationalisation of the international retail franchise system.

In their response to our paper, Amihud and Lev (1999) and Denis, Denis, and Sarin (1999) claim that disciplinary differences don't matter and that methods and evidence should speak for themselves. In contrast, we argue that important differences exist between financial economics and strategic management, leading to differing beliefs, norms, methods, and interpretations of empirical results. Using a strategic management perspective to review the evidence presented by Amihud and Lev in their earlier study (1981) and in their and Denis et al.'s critiques of our work (1999), we find no reason to revise our original conclusion: there is little theoretical or empirical basis for believing that monitoring by a firm's principals influences its diversification strategy and acquisition decisions.

Industrial foundations are self-governing, non-profit institutions that own business companies. This ownership structure is found in a fair number of Northern European companies, some of them successful world-class competitors. Standard agency theory would predict foundation-owned companies to be relatively inefficient since they lack monitoring by residual claimants and access to equity finance from the stock market. Nevertheless, empirical research (Thomsen 1996) has found that Danish foundation-owned companies do no worse in terms of profitability and growth than companies with dispersed ownership or family ownership. The paper considers and tests alternative explanations of this paradox. Explanations based on tax incentives, alternative control mechanisms and product-market advantages are rejected, but some support is found for performance advantages related to family control and long-term business commitment.

The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.

The paper investigates the agency argument that sales growth in firms with free cash flow (and without strong governance) is less profitable than sales growth for firms without free cash flow. It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable sales growth. Consistent with agency theory, firms with free cash flow gain less from sales growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance, despite allowing higher sales growth. In contrast, outside blocks held by mutual funds reduce sales growth substantially, but does not increase performance from sales growth. Copyright (c) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research into accounting risk-return relations largely relied on reference-based models of managerial choice. This focus ignores other explanations that may contribute to our understanding. Our study extends prior research by incorporating agency theory and implicit contracts theory into models based on the behavioral theory of the firm. We test our hypotheses in a large sample of US manufacturing firms in two different economic environments. Our results show some support for each theory, suggesting that multiple frameworks may better explain risk-return relations. Further, differences in results between the two economic environments imply that macroeconomic conditions may be important. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper assesses the effects of Berle and Means' study of the separation of corporate ownership from control on corporate financial reporting theory, research and policy. Their focus on shareholders and managers provided a starting point for the subsequent development of agency theory such that this relationship has come to dominate capital markets research and policy, to the virtual exclusion of parallel issues involving other parties. Berle and Means' omission of the role of investment funds led them to conclude that the separation of ownership from control problems was located between shareholders and company managers. We document the inaccuracy of this conclusion using historical and contemporary US evidence and contemporary evidence for Germany, Japan, South Africa, and Canada. In contrast to Berle and Means, we find that investment fund influence and control over companies is pervasive and probably a common characteristic of modern capital markets. Our analysis shows how viewing the capital markets setting from a richer, two-tier perspective involving investors, investment managers, and company managers results in quite different and better perspectives on financial reporting issues, particularly in terms of company reporting to funds, and fund reporting to investors. Consequently, we suggest that our understanding of capital markets may be improved by studying and portraying more diverse types of parties and their relationships than just managers and owners. This perspective subsumes the single-tier principal-agent model and allows multiple relationships to be portrayed and studied. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increasingly, the equity investments of individual investors are being channeled through financial institutions. This article posits that the role of institutional owners as financial intermediaries, and the resulting complexity that institutions bring to ownership, distinguish institutional ownership from individual ownership. I develop a model of institutional ownership, referred to as the nexus agency model (NAM), which reflects this complexity. The model provides a framework for identifying the potential additional agency costs to beneficial owners that are associated with owning via financial institutions. The degree to which owning via institutions benefits individual owners depends on the adequacy of the legal and regulatory environment and governance mechanisms in protecting individual owners' interests. The applicability of the nexus model to different institutional owner types is then demonstrated in a discussion of U.S. public and private pension plans and mutual funds, leading to the generation of a NAM-based research agenda for each type and across the types. The article ends with discussion of the model's applicability to non-U.S. institutional environments. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of ownership, control and incentives in encouraging managers to improve efficiency. Owners often tie managers to contracts that reduce conflict of interest between owners and managers. The differences between alternative business ownership structures have been investigated. According to theory, we expect managers with an outcome-dependent dealer contract to be more efficient than managers with a more integrated and less performance based employee dealer contract. We also analyse how competitive pressure might reduce the moral hazard problem and therefore affect contract design. Berle and Means (The Modern Corporation and Private Property, Macmillan, New York, 1932) long ago stated that the market mechanism could constrain the agency problem. Even so, this problem has scarcely been investigated empirically. This paper also considers the contractual effect of potential monitoring costs, education and relationship age in a model tested on data from 175 dealer contracts in a multinational oil company.

Governance in organizations according to traditional agency theory is based on the premise that managers and employees do not have identical goals. As a consequence, employees need to be monitored and controlled. If legal contracts are not sufficient for proper control, incentive contracts should be used. This paper argues that incentive contracts are not sufficient to solve governance issues in organizations due to problems in measurability and enforceability of presumed contract violations. Such problems are complicated by asymmetries in power, perspectives and aspirations between managers and employees. Acognitive argument is advanced suggesting that time constraints and bounded rationality render the idea of monitoring relatively ineffective. Governance ideas that focus on communication flow and information sharing are described. The role that other cognitive elements such as memory play in a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for understanding governance relations is discussed.

Linking executive compensation to stock price performance is predicted to decrease the usual positive price response to dividend increases for two reasons. One, increasing pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) exacerbates managers' optimistic bias regarding future firm performance, reducing the credibility of dividend signals. Two, increasing pay-performance sensitivity reduces the need for dividends as a means of reducing agency costs. Consistent with behavioral and agency theories of corporate finance, we find that price response does decrease as pay-performance sensitivity increases and that this effect is concentrated in firms with low market-to-book ratios. Additional findings are most consistent with the agency cost explanation. (c) 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Does owner management necessarily eliminate the agency costs of ownership? Drawing on agency literature and on the economic theory of the household, we argue that private ownership and owner management expose privately held, owner-managed firms to agency threats ignored by Jensen's and Meckling's (1976) agency model. Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a "self-control" problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which "harm themselves as well as those around them" (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for research on family and other types of privately held, owner-managed firms.

This paper analyzes the link between economics and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Although, historically there has been a strong link between the disciplines of strategy and economics, explicit citations of key RBV works has been disappointingly low in mainstream economics journals. However, there are substantial bodies of works that build implicitly on the ideas of the RBV, in particular the consequences of path dependency on firm behavior, to explain a number of different economic issues. The issues we review in the paper are all influenced by path dependency and include: (1) diversification and market entry, (2) corporate refocusing, and market exit, (3) explaining innovative activity among firms, (4) diversification and performance and (5) industry evolution with rapidly changing products. Furthermore, we identify a number of reasons that may have limited the explicit use of the RBV in economics, which include the problems of causal ambiguity, tautology and firm heterogeneity. Finally, potential areas for future research are identified, which include the interaction of the RBV and Agency Theory, the RBV as a dynamic theory, using the RBV to explain radical change and the application of the RBV to issues of antitrust.

Co-operative firms have been the subject of criticism by many economists, who base their arguments on property rights and agency theory: members do not control management, investments are short term, accumulated investments are below the economic optimum, etc. Nevertheless, many co-operative organisations do function well for their members. An analysis of the assumptions underlying the criticism reveals that this is not generally justified. As it focuses mainly on the functioning of capital markets, it disregards the vertically integrated character of the co-operatives, i.e. that their purpose is to counteract market failures on product markets. For many co-operatives, however, the critique is valid. Individual ownership in the form of tradable residual rights is thus motivated in many co-operatives. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This article develops a dynamic model of a firm in which diversification can be a value-maximizing strategy even if specialization is generally efficient. The central idea is that firms are composed of organizational capabilities that can be profitable in multiple businesses and that diversification is a search process by which firms seek businesses that are good matches for their capabilities. The theory can account for diversified firms trading at discounts compared to single-segment firms, as well as some empirical regularities that are challenging to the agency theory of diversification, such as positive returns to diversification announcements.

Agency theory, the predominant theoretical lens employed to examine leveraged buyouts, focuses on buyouts principally as a governance and control device. This view is especially useful in evaluating mature firms where discipline, incentives and limits to managerial discretion serve to mitigate the destruction or the downside of firm value. In contrast, an entrepreneurial view of buyouts is introduced, which incorporates upside incentives for growth and improvements not associated with pure efficiency gains or more effective monitoring to curtail opportunism. Investors such as venture capitalists in the UK and LBO associations in the US are increasingly investing in buyouts to realize entrepreneurial opportunities. Understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions with greater reliance on cognitive biases and heuristics provides an insightful lens for understanding why different types of buyouts occur. These perspectives provide a view of buyouts as a vehicle for strategic innovation and renewal that fosters upside growth opportunities in a variety of buyout types which heretofore have not been incorporated into buyout theory. Finally, research issues are discussed to facilitate future conceptual development and empirical testing of the upside as well as the downside of buyouts. (c) 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

This paper examines the cross-sectional relation between ownership structure and corporate performance of a sample of 434 manufacturing firms listed on the Chinese stock exchange. Following the agency theory and taking other influential factors into account, such as firm size, leverage ratio, variance of sales, growth of sale and firm age, the results suggest that there is a strong relation between ownership concentration and corporate performance, measured by Tobin's Q. A further classification of owners reveals that while shares held by state play a negative role in corporate governance, domestic institutional and managerial shareholdings improve the firms' performance.

This study is an extension of research which links top management team characteristics and the use of a variety of business strategies. Agency theory and information processing theory provided the framework used to investigate the complex business strategies of 219 Japanese firms in four sectors. Statistical results support our view that top team characteristics reflect important aspects of the corporate governance strategies needed to manage business strategies such as specialization, diversification and internationalization. Although there are substantial institutional differences in the business environments, it appears that there is increasing convergence in the Japanese and American approaches to corporate governance.

Agency theory proposes that increasing managerial ownership in a firm can help align owner/management interests and motivate managers for better performance. This paper examines the relationship between managerial stock holdings and firm performance in the restaurant industry. Using the financial data of restaurant companies during 1995-1996, this study found that managerial ownership was positively and significantly associated with most of the performance measures, particularly in firms with 0%-15% managerial ownership. Firm size, a control variable, was also found to have a positive impact on performance. The results suggest that large restaurant firms with relatively low managerial ownership may raise managerial holdings to enhance their profitability and Stock returns.

In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.

This paper examines the valuation effects associated with the incentive structures of different types of institutional investors using the ownership levels of public and private pension funds in a firm. The results suggest that institutional monitoring is associated with valuation effects when both observable and unobservable aspects of the relationship between institutions and firms are taken into account. Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions' administrators. Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional agents watching firm agents have conflicts of interest with other shareholders.

In this study, we examine in an agency-theoretic context the influence of executive equity stakes upon corporate strategy and firm value. We argue that beneficial, risk-increasing corporate strategies may initially be emphasized but non-value-maximizing, risk-reducing strategies may subsequently be emphasized as managers expand their stock ownership. We alternatively contend that stock options may have a consistently positive impact on firm risk taking and acquisition returns. The empirical findings are supportive of our expectations.

Some scholars have argued that CEOs may have excessive influence on their foundation's trustees to give away a portion of company profits to charitable causes in order to gain access to elite circles or support the CEO's personal causes. This may result in charitable contributions that ultimately serve the personal interests of the CEOs without regard to corporate interests or social needs. We examine the extent that CEOs appear to direct charitable giving to be compatible with their own personal interests, and if CEO participation on the foundation board affects the relationship between CEO personal interests and charitable giving. Using a sample of 160 corporate foundations, our results showed that CEOs' interests, as measured by membership in different non-profit organizations, was associated with foundation charitable giving. This association decreased, but was not eliminated, when CEOs were absent from the foundation board. Implications of these findings for researchers and managers are discussed in regards to both agency theory and stewardship theory.

The paper examines whether and how the increasing internationalization of firms impacts on the operation of a co-ordinated market economy. Following the tenets of agency theory, it assumes that an emerging market for corporate control changes the monitoring mechanisms that oversee management. Since Anglo-American forms of monitoring are usually associated with a higher return for investors compared with Continental European firms, a change in the distribution of the net value added of firms is expected. Using financial data on fifty-nine large German companies, the paper shows that the emerging convergence of German corporate governance practices to Anglo-American standards has had a weak, but significant, impact on the distribution of net value added. This is in contrast to the impact of the internationalization of firms on product markets, which does not have an effect. Since the market for corporate control is, however, still underdeveloped in Germany, the main effects remain to be seen.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the variables that influence the board structure adopted by firms and the subsequent relationship to the firm's performance. The results of this study of 229 Australian firms show that firms' investment opportunities are strongly associated with a higher proportion of executive directors ("EDs") on the board. The results also show that the negative relationship between a firm's investment opportunity set ("IOS") and firm performance is weakened at higher levels of non-executive director board domination. These results have implications for policy setters and managers of firms with investment opportunities. (c) City University of Hong Kong. (c) 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The structure of Spanish capital markets does not facilitate an efficient market for corporate control through takeover process, which assumes that inefficient management is replaced by competing teams. The ownership structure of listed companies is highly concentrated, with extremely low floating stock for some companies. At the same time an important number of companies have introduced anti-takeover provisions in their statutes.There is another way of disciplining management through the exit solution: by transferring the ownership of significant blocks of shares, a market for partial corporate control, as alternative to the takeover market. The objective of this paper is to test empirically the causes and consequences of block purchases in Spain for non-financial listed companies. The main results are: i) There is no evidence that previous poor performance of the companies causes block increases; ii) Block increases occur more frequently in companies with lower ownership concentration. After the block increase, on average, the ownership of the largest shareholder increases. iii) After block increases there are significant board changes,for both executive board members and also for non-executives. (iv) The transfer of blocks occurs more frequently for smaller companies.We conclude that agency theory predictions about the disciplining role of partial takeover activity are not fully supported. They are contingent on institutional characteristics of the corporate governance system. (c) 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Agency theory dominates research on equity holdings-firm performance relationships; however, extant studies provide no consensus about the direction and magnitude of such relationships. Consistent linkages have not been demonstrated for firm performance and CEO, officer, director, institutional, or blockholder equity. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of relevant empirical ownership-performance studies. The meta-analyses provide few examples of systematic relationships, lending little support for agency theory. We propose a substitution theory perspective for future ownership-performance research.

This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on R&D investments in the United States and Japan. It begins with the premise that U.S. and Japanese firms have distinct patterns of ownership that may result in disparities in R&D investments. Agency theory and stewardship theory are used to hypothesize about the relationship between ownership and R&D investments. Empirical evidence shows that the level of ownership concentration, and its impact, differ across countries. We argue that these differences result from a mixture of motives and incentives.

This article consists of two parts. The first part reports findings from a survey of the issues facing top executives in 272 Canadian family firms. Results show that succession is their No. 1 concern, thus supporting the predominant focus of family business researchers on succession issues. Results also show that concern about relationships with nonfamily managers is a close second in importance. The second part of the article uses Agency Theory to explain why relationships with nonfamily managers are so important. Empirical results show that both the extent and the criticality of a firm's dependence on nonfamily managers are statistically significant determinants of the importance. This study implies that relationships with nonfamily managers is a neglected research topic and points to a new direction for research in family business management. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications.

The principal-agent theory asserts that public firms' performance is driven by efficient capital and labor markets but is silent about non-listed private companies, which are less permeable to market forces (both capital and labor) than are public companies. We propose and test a 2 x 2 framework distinguishing owner-controlled vs. agent-led firms from firms with a flat vs. multilayer organization. Our findings provide highly contrasted results and raise important issues for further study of private firms.

Executives confront potentially conflicting pressures-maximizing shareholder wealth in the long term and appeasing shareholders in the near term. Because they must address near-term pressures to preserve tenure and to realize the benefits of long-term strategies, executives are increasingly likely to seek to mollify shareholders. We develop a behavioral-agency theoretical framework for studying how stock repurchase programs are used to help top managers appease shareholders. Analysis of 250 large U.S. firms suggested that stock repurchase programs are variously a function of information asymmetry, risky stock-based incentives, and performance expectations.

Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an organization than individuals under stewardship controls.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

This review evaluates the four major theories of corporate financing: (1) the Modigliani-Miller theory of capital-structure irrelevance, in which firm values and real investment decisions are unaffected by financing; (2) the trade-off theory, in which firms balance the tax advantages of borrowing against the costs of financial distress; (3) agency theories, in which financing responds to managers' personal incentives; and (4) the pecking-order theory, in which financing adapts to mitigate problems created by differences in information. These theories are conditional, not general. It is easy to find examples of each theory at work, but otherwise difficult to distinguish the theories empirically. Large, safe firms with mostly tangible assets tend to borrow more. Firms with high profitability and valuable growth opportunities tend to borrow less. Each of these tendencies is consistent with two or more of the major theories of financing. It may be possible to devise sharper tests by exporting the theories to developing economies, where agency and information problems are more severe. Further progress in understanding corporate financing decisions will require a deeper understanding of agency issues when value-maximizing operating and investment decisions cannot be observed or verified. But managers are not just temporary agents motivated by immediate pecuniary compensation or perquisites. Managers specialize their human capital to the firm. Some recent research suggests how financing can support the co-investment of human and financial capital. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Researchers use various definitions to describe the family firm. The characteristics of family firms that are stressed in each of these definitions are somehow related to family control. All characteristics together reflect a spectrum of family firm types along one core dimension: family involvement in the firm. However, it is more helpful to distinguish among family firms by using their precise type. Each particular family firm type is characterised by a set of agency relations within and between the family system, ownership system and the business system. This paper is a first attempt to apply the insights from agency theory on a highly simplified (reference) family firm situation where the father is full owner and the daughter manager of the family firm. Agency theory establishes the foundation for the optimal contract conditions between father and daughter. While real life is often characterised by bounded rationality and incomplete information, future research should help identify the "optimal contract" between the family/shareholders and management in various family firm types under these circumstances.

In agency theory, the remuneration packages of executive directors in large companies are seen as an attempt to give them a pattern of rewards that aligns their interests more closely with shareholders as a whole. The sensitivity of total executive rewards to share price performance has become the conventional yardstick for judgements concerning whether reward packages do indeed serve shareholders' interests or executives themselves. Long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) introduced in the UK from 1995 have imposed new, firm-specific performance conditions on senior managers. While LTIPs are designed to increase performance-pay sensitivity, however, they also give executives new opportunities to manipulate the terms of LTIPs in their own favour, at the expense of shareholders and stakeholders in general. This paper presents the first estimates of UK total executive rewards that include detailed LTIP valuations. It finds that, while increasing average total rewards, the presence of LTIPs is actually associated with reductions in the sensitivity of executives' total rewards to shareholder return. This raises doubts concerning both the effectiveness of the LTIP instrument and the validity of an agency perspective in this context.

This article examines the implications of the escalation in institutional inves power and heterogeneity for two dominant theories of corporate governanceagency theory and stakeholder theory. From this analysis, a new view of the agency relationship between institutional investors and their portfolio firms emerges, which recognizes the institutions' market power, complex role as financial intermediaries, and possible involvement in simultaneous and opposing agency contracts. We also conclude that stakeholder theorists should reconsider these newly empowered shareholders'moral standing in relation to their portfolio firms, and they should reexamine the identities and goals of these modern investors. To that end, we demonstrate that a novel, intragroup application of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder framework to heterogeneous institutional investors illuminates their varying levels of stakeholder salience.

In this paper we present empirical evidence on the attitudes of Taiwanese company directors on the role and function of the board of directors in Taiwanese corporate governance. Our findings arise from a questionnaire survey distributed to the directors of a sample of companies listed on the Taiwanese Securities Exchange (TSE). Our findings provide a picture of the current state of corporate governance in Taiwan. The respondents indicate that the board of directors constitutes the most important instrument in Taiwanese corporate governance and our findings endorse the important role played by outside directors in the corporate governance system in Taiwan. Furthermore, the respondents endorsed the agency theory perspective on corporate governance as they considered the presence of outside directors improved corporate accountability to shareholders. There is, however, evidence that few companies have created remuneration and audit committees. We also found that Taiwanese directors are dissatisfied with the influence of families on the corporate governance of listed companies and do not consider that outside directors on boards should be related to founding families. Overall, the directors displayed an awareness of accountability issues and a desire to improve accountability and transparency. They clearly want international harmonisation of corporate governance standards and view corporate governance reform as a means of attracting foreign funds into Taiwan. This is an important finding as it endorses the work of the OECD and other international bodies in harmonising corporate governance at a global level.

Stock compensation (particularly ESOs) has become a significant component of total compensation in some countries. While ESOs dilute stock prices, they are expected to provide incentives to employees because the employees' payoff is linked to the firm's performance. In some countries, however, there are essentially no ESOs and annual bonus is the only component of compensation that is linked to the firm's performance. The paper examines a sample of firms that are not permitted to grant ESOs but are required by law to pay an annual bonus to employees in accordance with the bonus rate specified in the firm's articles of incorporation. The research question is whether equity value of these firms is positively related to the annual bonus components, particularly stock bonus. Moreover, the analysis incorporates agency theory and considers the firm's future investment opportunities. Firms with greater investment opportunities face more severe agency problems and stock bonus is expected to provide more benefits to them. Since the incentive effect provided by stock bonus is likely to decrease as the level of stock bonus increases, due to employees' risk aversion problems, the relation between equity value and stock bonus is expected to be nonlinear.

In this article, the cost minimization model of dividends, which is underpinned by agency theory, is estimated and tested on data from 882 private sector firms listed on the Mumbai Stock Exchange for the period 1994 to 1998. Specifically, the hypothesis implied by the model is that private sector firms in India set their target payout ratios so as to minimize the sum of agency costs and the costs associ ated with raising external finance. Cross-sectional weighted least squares method ology is used, and squared and interaction terms are introduced into the model, along with a number of novel explanatory variables. It is found that government ownership, insider ownership, risk, debt, and growth opportunities, have a negative impact on the payout ratio. In contrast, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and dispersed ownership have a positive impact on the payout ratio. These results are consistent with the predictions of the cost minimization model of dividends in the context of listed companies in India. (c) 2003, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the financial performance effect of three corporate governance mechanisms: (i) founding family CEO, (ii) board ownership, and (iii) board independence. The developed hypotheses are tested using multivariate ordinary least-squares regression on a 3-year sample of 32 publicly traded maritime firms from Norway and Sweden, and compared to the results of the same hypotheses tested on a sample of 96 manufacturing firms. This study concludes that maritime firms with a founding family CEO have better financial performance than maritime firms with a non-founding family CEO. Support was also found for the hypothesis that a high level of board independence enhances profitability in maritime firms. Contrary to agency theory predictions, no significant relation was found between the level of board ownership and firm profitability in maritime firms, although board ownership control was significant in the sample of manufacturing firms.

The Japanese system of corporate governance and in particular the role played by banks and other financial institutions have been the subject of considerable research and controversy in recent years. We estimate the impact of equity ownership by financial institutions on firm performance in Japan for 1986-1991, a period that precedes many of the problems of the ensuing decade. We find that while ownership by financial institutions is associated with unprofitable diversification, such ownership is, on balance, positively associated with firm profitability. Some implications of these findings for Japan's unique system of governance are discussed.

This paper analyzes the determinants of the managerial decision to recognize tax credits arising from past losses. Results based on a sample of Spanish companies ranging from 1540 to 3872 firm-year observations suggest that the decision to recognize tax credits is mainly determined by past earnings and leverage and, to a lesser extent, by future earnings expectations. Moreover, we found evidence of the existence of a positive relationship between tax credits and some variables proxying for income smoothing practices. The evidence presented here has implications for financial analysis as well as for the accounting standard setting process. (c) 2001 Asociacion Espanola de Contabilidad y Administracion de Empresas.

Do outside directors on corporate boards make a difference in firm performance during institutional transitions ? What leads to the practice of appointing outside directors in the absence of legal mandate? This article addresses these two important questions by drawing not only on agency theory, but also resource dependence and institutional theories. Taking advantage of China's institutional transitions, our findings, based on an archival database covering 405 publicly listed firms and 1211 company-years, suggest that outsider directors do make a difference infirm performance, if such performance is measured by sales growth, and that they have little impact on financial performance such as return on equity (ROE). The results also document a bandwagon effect behind the diffusion of the practice of appointing outsiders to corporate boards. The article not only highlights the need to incorporate multiple theories beyond agency theory in corporate governance research, but also generates policy implications in light of the recent trend toward having more outside directors on corporate boards in emerging economies.

This study investigates the structure of the board of directors at socially responsible (SR) firms. Using a sample of 394 SR firms and comparing these to a matched sample of firms, I find that SR firms have characteristics associated with effective board structures. For instance, SR firms have more outsiders and women directors, and less instance of CEO/Chairman duality than non-SR firms. Results are similar when using a continuous measure of social responsibility. Also, I document that SR firms have higher Governance Index scores than the matched sample. Overall, this suggests that a reason for shareholders' appeal in socially responsible firms and mutual funds may be because these firms have stronger governance mechanisms in place than do non-SR firms. In addition, it appears that effective governance structures are more likely to exist in firms that focus on a broad range of stakeholders, rather than in firms that have a strict focus on shareholder wealth maximization.

Prior research on the relationship between corporate controls and firm performance is premised on the notion that, in theory, there is direct association between corporate governance and firm performance. However, extensive research has produced mixed and often weak results. In this paper, we posit, as a primary relationship, a negative association between growth and firm performance and then examine whether corporate governance variables moderate this negative relationship. Our results support this notion and show that the role of corporate governance variables in firm performance should be evaluated in the context of the firm's external environment measured in this study in terms of growth opportunities.

A curious ownership structure is found in Northern Europe-foundations that own and operate business companies. The foundations are non-profit entities, they have no members and no owners, and they cannot be dissolved. In many cases, these entities control more than 50% of the votes in successful international companies. Obviously, this structure completely blocks the market for corporate control, but it also violates other basic principles of agency theory and corporate finance. Nevertheless, we present evidence that a sample of foundation-owned companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange are at least as efficient as other listed companies in terms of risk adjusted stock returns, accounting returns and Tobin's Q. Thus, they question whether profit-seeking ownership is a necessary condition for competitive enterprise. (c) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper examines the joint impact of capital requirements and managerial incentive compensation on bank charter value and bank risk. Most of the previous literature in the area of banking and agency theory has focused on asymmetric information between either banks and regulators, (and therefore on the role of bank capital), or between bank shareholders and bank managers, (and therefore on the role of managerial ownership). In this paper we unify these issues and present empirical results from the regression of capital requirements jointly with measures of incentive compensation on Tobin's Q, our proxy for bank charter value, and on the standard deviation of total return, our proxy for bank risk. In a sample of 102 bank holding companies we find that capital levels are consistently a significant positive factor in determining bank charter value and a significant negative factor in determining risk. On the other hand, we find our six measures of incentive compensation to be generally insignificant relative to charter value but do provide some evidence consistent with a theory relating types of incentive compensation with risk.

This article examines the differences, tensions and overlaps between agency and stewardship theories of corporate governance. The context is a hostile bid for Blue Circle Industries, a FTSE 100 company, and the focus is upon its Chief Executive Officer's actions in response. CEOs occupy a position of pivotal importance during such takeover bids, and it is salient to examine their resultant motivations and payoffs. While agency theory suggests that CEOs may act in self-interested ways, diverging from the interests of shareholders, ongoing stewardship theory sees CEOs as fundamentally honest and caring about their company and shareholders' interests. The hostile bid is an opportunity for the target CEO to fight at any cost, or to act in the best interests of stakeholders.In examining the target CEO's actions, this article suggests there is more complexity than these two theories acknowledge and the relationship between them is not one of simple opposition. The article identifies a framework for making sense of CEO/stakeholder relationships, and highlights the importance to boards of understanding how CEOs manage differential stakeholder pressures over time.

The model is based upon the differences between the investment public's and underwriters 'fears of the consequences of management entrenchment and other agency problems. The model suggests that IPO underpricing shouM be a curvilinear hump-shaped function of retention. A large-sample empirical exploration verifies the curvilinear relation.

This paper extends Demsetz and Lehn's (1985) results and studies the determinants of corporate ownership concentration across countries in light of Qu's (2004) model using a newly constructed dataset of 1,070 publicly traded stock companies from 45 countries. Estimation results show that ownership concentration varies systematically with respect to certain firm-specific economic variables and country characteristics in ways that are consistent with value maximization and predictions of agency theory. After controlling for firm-level determinants such as size, auditing practice, return rate, etc., ownership concentration is significantly lower in countries with more developed stock market and more effective investor protection.

The governance structure of public corporations is determined by the agency relationship between shareholders and managers, and the agency theory predicts that deregulation of an industry leads to governance adaptation. Deregulation of the Japanese banking business in the 1980s offers an interesting case study in this framework, as Japanese banks fell into serious solvency problems in the postderegulation 1990s. This paper investigates whether ineffective governance was responsible for the plight of Japanese banks. The sample is 384 corporations that were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange between 1983 and 1990, which includes 59 banks. One of the findings is that bank shareholders allowed more diffuse ownership structure after deregulation, which demonstrates that the agency theory did not hold for shareholders of Japanese banks.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This introductory chapter outlines the features of the new approach to CG that can be built by integrating the insights from the different contributions gathered in the book. Further specific theses advanced in this chapter are that the 'shareholder view' and the unabashed recommendation of pay for performance misapply agency and property right theories themselves; that CG design should be grounded in an empirically-based appreciation of preferences and motivation; that the portfolio of governance mechanisms should be enlarged to include organizational mechanisms such as negotiation, social control, and community governance; and that, contrary to common wisdom, an economic and organizational efficiency view of CG should lead to differentiated rather than homogeneous solutions, while institutional isomorphism and legitimacy may lead to inefficient convergence.

In one of the worst political scandals of the 1990s, a large number of members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote checks on nonexistent balances in what has become known as the House bank scandal. Agency theory tells us that the most entrenched members of the House should be more likely to consume excessive perquisites in the form of writing more bad checks. In this paper, we employ a Tobit model to test whether more entrenched members of the House engaged in excessive writing of bad checks. Our results support the agency-theoretic interpretation and confirm that entrenched members were more likely to write a greater number of bad checks. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This review and introduction to the Special Issue on 'Strategy Research in Emerging Economies' considers the nature of theoretical contributions thus far on strategy in emerging economies. We classify the research through four strategic options: (1) firms from developed economies entering emerging economies; (2) domestic firms competing within emerging economies; (3) firms from emerging economies entering other emerging economies; and (4) firms from emerging economies entering developed economies. Among the four perspectives examined (institutional theory, transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, and agency theory), the most dominant seems to be institutional theory. Most existing studies that make a contribution blend institutional theory with one of the other three perspectives, including seven out of the eight papers included in this Special Issue. We suggest a future research agenda based around the four strategies and four theoretical perspectives. Given the relative emphasis of research so far on the first and second strategic options, we believe that there is growing scope for research that addresses the third and fourth.

To date, the results of agency theory-based research exploring the impact of board composition on firms' critical decisions are equivocal. Through meta-analyses, this study reveals systematic relationships between board composition and six of the seven critical decisions examined. Interestingly, the results provide little support to agency theory's predictions on the impact of board composition on critical decisions that involve a potential conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2005 Southern Management Association. All rights reserved.

We develop a principal-agent model in an entrepreneurial setting and test the model's predictions using unique data on entrepreneurial effort and wealth in privately held firms. Accounting for unobserved firm heterogeneity using instrumental-variables techniques, we find that entrepreneurial ownership shares increase with outside wealth and decrease with firm risk; effort increases with ownership; and effort increases firm performance. The magnitude of the effects in the cross-section of firms suggests that agency costs may help explain why entrepreneurs concentrate large fractions of their wealth in firm equity.

We reason that agency theory's behavioral assumptions may too closely reflect the US institutional context to explain the governance heritages that exist elsewhere. We propose that what constitutes opportunistic behavior and what can be done to limit it may vary due to differences in national background and formal institutions. We then test the validity of this nationally bounded model using historical sociology analysis of three nations whose corporate governance heritages are believed to differ (USA, Sweden, and France). Specifically, we review their political, cultural, and economic institutions to explore the different ways that their governance practices have evolved and infer causes for these historical variations.

The finance literature identifies two agency problems between managers and outside share-holders. First, there is a divergence-of-interests problem as management ownership falls. Second, there is an offsetting entrenchment problem when management ownership increases within intermediate regions of ownership. Agency problems are mitigated through contracting, but contracts are often based on accounting numbers prepared by management. Because accounting numbers must be reliable for contracts to be enforced, agency theory predicts a demand for higher-quality auditors when agency problems are more severe. However, extant studies find no significant or robust relation between management ownership and audit firm size. In contrast to extant research, this study samples unlisted companies rather than listed companies for two reasons. First, the monitoring value of auditing may be higher in unlisted companies because they are less vulnerable to takeover and they are required to disclose much less nonaccounting information to shareholders. Second, unlisted companies have greater variation in management ownership, which permits more powerful tests of the demand for auditing as ownership varies between 0 percent and 100 percent. Consistent with a divergence-of-interests effect, the association between management ownership and audit firm size is found to be significantly negative within low and high regions of management ownership. The association is flatter and slightly positive within intermediate regions of management ownership, suggesting the existence of an opposite entrenchment effect. The negative association and the nonlinearity is consistent with the finance literature and with the predictions of agency theory. (c) CAAA.

This article investigates the relation between corporate governance and business ethics in the Asia-Pacific region. It draws on four examples of countries in the region (Australia, China, Singapore, and India), not because they are representative of certain regional characteristics, but as a means of reflecting on the diversity in this region. These countries display pronounced differences in terms of inter alia, historical development, cultural and social factors, legal system, corporate governance model, political system, and economic development. The complex interaction of all these considerations provides the context for corporate governance and business ethics in each of the countries. The article highlights different orientations to stakeholder management and integrity behavior in the boardroom and executives' offices. Although globalization and financial market hegemony suggests a convergent model is theoretically desirable, this research suggests that the human capacity to protect diversity and enshrine regional and local interests seems likely to inhibit rapid change.

This paper addresses how the global activities undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international settings impact corporate governance mechanisms and accountability systems. International corporate governance and accountability research, whether from a political science, economics, finance, or accounting perspective, has thus far predominantly focused on the comparison of corporate governance schemes in different countries and on the investigation of institutional parameters that determine these schemes. Straying from this line of inquiry, this article discusses how globalization at the firm level affects governance and accountability systems at parent- and subsidiary-levels. It emphasizes how an MNE's globalization attributes such as globalization scale, foreign adaptation, global competition, and international experience influence the design of governance mechanisms such as board size, board composition, executive compensation, market discipline, interlocking directorate, ownership concentration, duality and inbreeding, as well as the design of accountability systems such as accounting information, auditing standards, and financial and non-financial disclosures. This article bases its conjectures on information processing and agency theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper attempts to investigate the determinants of the capital structure of a sample of 972 listed companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China in 2003. Various theories, namely, the trade-off, pecking order and agency theories, are deployed to explain and predict the signs and significance of each factor identified by Ragan and Zingales (1995) and Booth et al. (2001). Furthermore, we include institutional shareholdings, including state agency shareholdings, state-owned shareholdings and privately owned shareholdings, as corporate governance variables to examine the effects of corporate structure on the debt financing behaviours. As well documented, we find that profitability is negatively related to capital structure at a highly significant level. The size and risk of the firms are positively related to the debt ratio - but only in term of market value measures of capital structure. The years of the companies being listed on stock markets are positively related to capital structure, indicating the access of the firms to debt finance is more easily judged by book value. Tax is not a factor in influencing debt ratio. Ownership structure has a negative effect on the capital structure. The firms with higher institutional shareholdings tend to avoid using debt financing, a behaviour that can be explained by entrenchment effects. A further classification of the institutional shareholders reveals that, among the three groups of institutional shareholding, the state institutions, including state agency and state-owned institutions, were more averse to debt financing, particularly for state-owned institutions. There is no strong evidence indicating debt-averse behaviour by domestic institutional shareholders. (c) Springer 2006.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This paper draws on field study data to provide an examination of the condominium owner/manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears that the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, P.K., J. Business Res. 20 (1990) 31). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist-based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

This paper examines the relation between board composition and firm value in the presence of significant ownership concentration using publicly traded Canadian firms over the 1993-1997 period. The results indicate that greater board independence does not have a positive influence on firm value and that poorly performing firms increase the proportion of outside directors in subsequent periods. This may result from firms acting to appease unhappy investors by adding outside directors. However, the results also indicate that directors from financial institutions can provide monitoring benefits. Finally, the negative effect of dual class common stock on firm value is mitigated by board independence, the participation of officers from financial institutions and audit committee independence. These findings suggest that sound governance practices can enhance firm value in countries with high ownership concentration even in the presence of strong minority shareholder protection.

How and to what extent should a transnational corporation's governance structures be differentiated to satisfy varying strategic roles played by foreign subsidiaries? Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying strategic roles of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

This article brings forward the argument that the practical implementation of a corporate governance code cannot be realized by a compliance program alone. Its relevance in everyday business is determined by the moral values of the company culture. In this context, governance is defined as a company's resources and capabilities, including the moral resources, to take on responsibility for all its stakeholders. A critical discussion of the agency theory, transaction cost theory, and organization theory shows that such an approach is possible only when a company is not perceived as a maximizing machine for shareholders' interests but as an economic form of cooperation of internal and external resources and stakeholders. An empiric study on 22 European corporate governance codes shows that the predominant majority of European codes orientate themselves to stakeholders and the company. The discussion of the empirical data reveals six basic principles that determine all European corporate governance codes: shareholder rights, transparency, voting rights, regulation of remuneration, design of organizational structures, and corporate social responsibility.

A buy-out is a fundamental change in the structure of ownership that may affect the way employee relations develop within an organization. Little is known about the impact of buy-outs upon employee relations. This paper aims to address this gap. We focus on two main questions. First, what are the effects of a buy-out on employee relations in an organization? Second, does the national institutional context affect the impact of buy-outs on employee relations? The paper reports changes to employee relations in buy-outs in the contrasting institutional environments of the UK and the Netherlands. Overall, we find that buy-outs positively affect HR practices with increases in training, employee involvement, the number of employees and pay levels. The positive effects appear to be significantly stronger in a less institutionalized environment like the UK than in the more institutionalized environment of the Netherlands. Buy-outs raised HRM practices in the UK to a level closer to, although still below, that of Dutch buy-outs. (c) 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

In the context of agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976. Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 305-360), how insider stock ownership relates to firm performance is explored in this paper. The relevant performance measure used is total factor productivity. Insiders are classified into executives, board members and blockholders so as to facilitate a detailed study. Five-year (1996-2000) panel data of 333 Taiwanese listed electronics firms are examined. It is observed that total insider ownership remains steady while the executive-to-insider holding ratio increases significantly. In terms of the effect on total factor productivity, neither the total insider ownership nor the board-to-insider holding ratio shows any influence on productivity. However, productivity first decreases then increases with the executive-to-insider holding ratio, forming a U-shaped relationship. The results indicate that stock ownership of top officers in high-tech firms should be encouraged to enhance productivity. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

In this paper, we want to focus on the interactions of shareholder theory, stakeholder theory, institutional theory and agency theory in terms of corporate social responsibility. We will specifically study this issue in the context of commercial banks in the financial sector. Financial firms appear to be subject to strong technical and institutional pressures. They are also more opaque and subject to heavier regulation than their non-financial counterparts. It appears that the application of agency-based assumptions to the financial sector is inadequate in explaining corporate governance and related social responsibility practices. In this context, the structure of asymmetric information seems to be more complex and multi-dimensional. It takes place first between the depositors, the bank and the regulatory authorities; second, between the shareholders, the bank and the regulatory authorities; last, between the borrowers, the managers and the regulatory authorities. These parties also constitute the firms' stakeholders. In this respect, the state appears to be a major stakeholder and it is in a position to affect all other bank/stakeholder relations through its regulations and participation in the financial sector. These are the factors that intensify institutional pressures in this sector. The institutional embeddedness inherent in a special context is likely to affect stakeholder position and attitudes. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the conflicting nature of being a stakeholder under institutional pressures and it articulates the factors that determine the behavior of the state as a stakeholder in shaping corporate social responsibility practices of firms.

Corporate governance is importantly based on agency theory and relies on extrinsic incentives to align the interests of managers, employees and shareholders. This article argues that in view of recent corporate scandals, private governance can learn from public governance: (1) Goaloriented intrinsic motivation of agents should be supported by fixed incomes and an extensive selection process of employees; (2) Extrinsic, but non-monetary incentives (e.g. conferring orders and titles) can be used; (3) The power of actors should be restricted by a clear division of power, appropriate rules of succession and institutionalised competition for positions in firms.

This paper applies agency theory to explore the relationship between insider stock ownership and firm performance, particularly in terms of technical efficiency. Insiders are further classified into executives, outside directors, and large shareholders to conduct a detailed study. Six-year (1996-2001) panel data of 416 Taiwanese listed electronics firms are examined by the stochastic production frontier approach. It is observed that raising the executive-to-insider holding ratio first causes a decrease and then an increase in technical efficiency, forming a U-shaped relationship. However, the board-to-insider holding ratio is negatively associated with technical efficiency. The results indicate that equity ownership of top officers in high-tech firms should be encouraged to enhance firm productivity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper shows how clear divergences arise across the EU in how executive remuneration is structured. Sharp differences also occur in the adoption of best practices in pay-setting and in the disclosure of executive pay. These divergences are broadly in line, as agency theory predicts, with blockholding and dispersed-ownership governance profiles. While the EU has recently adopted two important 2004 recommendations on executive pay, the paper argues that EU-led reforms should be undertaken with care. Harmonization should be limited and only address disclosure. Disclosure is central to the adoption of effective incentive contracts in that it can manage the particular agency costs of executive pay, across dispersed and blockholding systems, without intervening in governance choices and structures. Any other interventions in the pay process carry the risk of distorting competition and interfering with the dynamics of different ownership structures and economic contexts. (c) The Authors (2005).

The problems of agency theory related to security valuation are normally discussed in the context of "owner-managers" and "outside shareholders", and/or equity-holders and debt-holders. In this paper we discuss agency problems that emerge when there is only one shareholder (and no debt), but where the shareholder is a trust with separate income and capital beneficiaries. Trust ownership of this sort is not uncommon. The agency problems emerge as the two classes of beneficiaries have claims on cash flows that occur at different times, with income beneficiaries having claims until "capital" is transferred to the capital beneficiaries. The agency problems that are discussed are dividends, risk shifting, capital structure, cost capitalisation, and investment policy. In all cases agency problems arise, and in some respects the agency problems are more pervasive than in the more "orthodox" settings. (c) 2005 New Zealand Association of Economists.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less in countries with poor investor protection because of the greater ability of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from cash holdings in such countries. Using various specifications of the valuation regressions of Fama and French (1998), we find that the relation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in countries with poor investor protection than in other countries. In further support of the importance of agency theories, the relation between dividends and firm value is weaker in countries with stronger investor protection.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Corporate governance theory predicts that leverage affects agency costs and thereby influences firm performance. We propose a new approach to test this theory using profit efficiency, or how close a firm's profits are to the benchmark of a best-practice firm facing the same exogenous conditions. We are also the first to employ a simultaneous-equations model that accounts for reverse causality from performance to capital structure. We find that data on the US banking industry are consistent with the theory, and the results are statistically significant, economically significant, and robust.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Prior research on listed companies in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore during and before the 1997 financial crisis has reported a significant association between ownership structure and the extent of voluntary disclosure in annual reports. We examine data for Malaysia after the 1997 financial crisis to assess whether the regulatory reaction to the crisis increased the awareness of disclosure as a tool of corporate governance and reduced the influence of insider domination on voluntary disclosure. We contrast director ownership and government ownership as determinants of voluntary disclosure in Malaysian company annual reports. Additionally, we include consideration of proprietary costs by testing whether industry competitiveness has an impact on voluntary disclosure. We find that director ownership is significantly associated with the extent of voluntary disclosure while government ownership, new governance initiatives and industry competitiveness are not significant in pointing companies towards greater transparency. We conclude that, despite the upheaval of the economic crisis, traditional influences of director ownership and family domination of the board outweigh the effect of government-backed accountability initiatives in determining the extent of voluntary disclosure.

We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

This paper contributes to the agency theory literature by identifying relations between family control and corporate governance structure. Emerging literature supports the notion that family control creates strong incentives that have potentially competing influences on the manner in, and extent to, which internal corporate governance mechanisms are utilized. A sample of 100 listed companies (evenly divided between family and nonfamily firms) is used to test the hypotheses that corporate governance structures are different between family and nonfamily firms; and that family firms adopt optimal corporate governance structures. This research finds evidence that suggests that family firms utilize substantially different corporate governance structures from nonfamily firms and that these differences lead to performance differentials. Indeed, results suggest that family control creates, rather than negates, agency costs and future research may be well rewarded by pursuing this latter notion further.

This paper examines the corporate financing behaviour of listed companies in the People's Republic of China. Our results suggest that some determinants of firm leverage (e.g., size, asset tangibility, growth opportunities and profitability) commonly cited in studies on developed economies also appear to be important in China. In particular, the positive relationships that firm size and asset tangibility have with firm leverage are consistent with the predictions of the static trade-off capital structure model. However, these commonly quoted determinants function in a way different from that reported in developing countries. Moreover, we do not find that State ownership, legal person ownership and foreign ownership have important influences on the capital structure choices of Chinese firms. Given the tight regulatory control over equity issues and acute owner-manager incentive conflicts in State-owned firms, we also hypothesise, and find evidence to support, that Chinese firms have built-in incentives for raising equity. This provides one explanation of the negative effect of profitability on firm leverage and shows that some of the unique Chinese institutional features do help shape corporate financing behaviour.

Prior research over several decades has catalogued many positive motives underlying firms' decisions to engage in joint ventures and other forms of alliances. In this empirical analysis, we investigate whether agency problems brought about by the separation of ownership and control also stimulate the development of firms' joint venture portfolios. By focusing on joint ventures, as opposed to diversification in general or acquisitions, we address the recent debate on agency theory's domain. Results from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms' alliance portfolios offer supporting evidence, and comparable findings are obtained for international and domestic joint ventures. Agency hazards are also found to bring about extensions of firms' nonequity alliance portfolios in both the international and domestic settings. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This article assesses the corporate governance-related antecedents of nomination committee adoption, and the impact of nomination committees' existence and their composition on board independence and board demographic diversity. We conducted a longitudinal study of board composition amongst 210 Swiss public companies from January 2001 through December 2003, a period during which the Swiss (Stock) Exchange (SWX) introduced new corporate governance-related disclosure guidelines. We find firms with nomination committees are more likely to have a higher number of independent and foreign directors, but not more likely to have a higher number of female board members. Further, the existence of nomination committees is associated with a higher degree of nationality diversity but is not related to board educational diversity. We also find that nomination committee composition matters in the nomination of independent and foreign, but not of female directors. Our results suggest that understanding different board roles and composition require a multi-theoretical approach, and that agency theory, resource-dependence theory and group effectiveness theory help to explain different aspects of board composition and effectiveness. Finally, the article discusses the concept of diversity and appropriate ways to study diversity in a boardroom context. (c) Springer 2006.

This study investigated the tenure of CEOs in a sample of 304 listed companies in Taiwan; 63 firms were family controlled, 241 were not. The results show that CEO turnover is significantly lower in family firms and its relationship to corporate performance is negative. CEO ownership and board ownership are not significant in explaining the length of family CEO tenure. These findings imply that family boards can still effectively replace the CEO despite relatively low ownership. From the ownership structure perspective, this study suggested that the agency theory is applicable for nonfamily firms in Taiwan, but unsuitable for family firms.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Grounded in agency theory, this study investigates how the strength of shareholder rights influences the extent of firm diversification and the excess value attributable to diversification. The empirical evidence reveals that the strength of shareholder rights is inversely related to the probability to diversify. Furthermore, firms where shareholder rights are more suppressed by restrictive corporate governance suffer a deeper diversification discount. Specifically, we document a 1.1-1.4% decline in firm value for each additional governance provision imposed on shareholders. An explicit distinction is made between global and industrial diversification. Our results support agency theory as an explanation for the value reduction in diversified firms. The evidence in favor of agency theory appears to be more pronounced for industrial diversification than for global diversification. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite theoretical developments in recent years, our understanding of corporate capital structure remains incomplete. Prior empirical research has been dominated by archival regression studies which are limited in their ability to fully reflect the diversity found in practice. The present paper reports on a comprehensive survey of corporate financing decision-making in UK listed companies. A key finding is that firms are heterogeneous in their capital structure policies. About half of the firms seek to maintain a target debt level, consistent with trade-off theory, but 60% claim to follow a financing hierarchy, consistent with pecking order theory. These two theories are not viewed by respondents as either mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Many of the theoretical determinants of debt levels are widely accepted by respondents, in particular the importance of interest tax shield, financial distress, agency costs and also, at least implicitly, information asymmetry. Results also indicate that cross-country institutional differences have a significant, impact on financial decisions. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Challenging the dominant economic agency theory of corporate governance with a new discourse drawn from institutional theory, the paper analyses how management accounting is implicated in corporate governance. The proposed institutional theory of agency links the micro-institutions of the organization that are informed by the practices of management accounting with external institutional players and stakeholders. The paper identifies emerging narratives in which the management accounting profession has recognised a distinctive, post-Enron set of sensibilities. Although techniques drawn from strategic management accounting can be adapted to embed better corporate governance practices, the institutional theory of agency identifies tensions between the heroic CEO narrative and the routinization of strategy implicit in strategic management accounting.

China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) traditionally have been governed by the Communist Party. Privatization has brought greater numbers of investors who have a stake and demand a voice in how SOEs are managed. Three traditional governance perspectives are agency theory, resource dependence, and institutional theory, but China's transition introduces several additional governance approaches. Are "capitalism with Chinese characteristics" and "bureaucratic entrepreneurialism" paradoxes? Based on initial interviews of SOE executives, a survey of top managers and board chairs of listed companies, and subsequent interviews and observations in select case companies, this paper develop a taxonomy of SOE governance that now exists in China. Two of the approaches represent the extremes of the old state-centered regimes and the new shareholder-centered regimes. Considering China's historical and cultural contexts coupled with its current stage of economic transition, two additional approaches to corporate governance are to have a vacuum as neither the state nor shareholders dominate or - in unique contrast to other countries - a hybrid of both.

This paper investigates the impact of M&As on bidder (CEO and other) executive compensation employing a unique sample of 100 completed bids in the UK over the 1998-2001 period. Our findings indicate that less independent and larger boards award CEOs significantly higher bonuses and salary following M&A completion both for the full sample and for the UK and US sub-samples. UK CEOs and executives are rewarded more for the effort exerted in accomplishing intra-industry or large mergers than for diversifying or small mergers and their cash pay is unaffected by other measures of their managerial skill or performance. US bidders are rewarded at higher levels than their UK counterparts and their remuneration is related only to measures of CEO dominance over the board of directors. Overall our findings offer support for the managerial power rather than the agency theory perspective on managerial compensation.

Three perspectives are investigated: (1) production cost economics, including cost structure, cost behavior, cost drivers, the design of cost allocation systems, and the appropriate level of cost aggregation; (2) agency theory, including incentives to bias information or shift costs, the relation between benchmark disclosure and cost containment, and issues pertaining to compensation contracts and performance evaluation; and (3) industrial economics, including the effects of competition and mergers on accounting systems and costs, and capital budgeting responses to regulation.

Consistent with predictions of agency theory, we find direct evidence that executive stock option grants have value implications for firm performance. This inference is drawn from evaluation of various motivations for the use of such grants in executive compensation: value enhancement, risk taking, tax benefit, signaling and cash conservation. We find consistent evidence for the value enhancement motivation to reduce agency costs. As well, they signal for positive price sensitive information. Our results reject the tax benefit and cash conservation motivations. This finding is robust after controlling for the endogenous character of executive stock option grants and other equity-based grants. (c) Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Two of the most widely tested predictions of agency theory are that there exists a negative association between an agent's pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) and the risk of output, and that PPS enhances performance. Empirical evidence has been mixed. This paper proposes a new utility function and develops a model that introduces a "wealth effect" and also allows the agent to control the (idiosyncratic) risk of output. When risk is endogenous, the paper shows that the two predictions may not hold. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on agency theory [Jensen and Meckling: 1976, Journal of Financial Economics 3: 305-360] how managerial stock ownership affects the survival of initial public offerings (IPOs) is explored in this paper. A sample of 560 IPOs listed in Taiwan is examined using the accelerated failure time model, a survival analysis technique. Insiders, the broad definition of management, are further classified into top officers and outside directors to conduct a detailed study. It is observed that the survival time of IPOs first decreases and then increases with the percentage of total insider ownership at the time of offering, forming a U-shaped relationship. Additionally, the survival time is positively affected by the officer-to-insider holding ratio. The results suggest that equity stake owned by management, particularly by top officers, of an IPO firm should be encouraged in order to reduce agency cost, and thus enhance firm survivability in the aftermarket.

This paper investigates a new dataset of franchise networks in nine countries in order to assess whether and to what extent do institutions influence the practice of franchising. Our regressions relate the structure of franchise networks (the rate of franchised units as opposed to corporate units) to individual parameters supposed to reflect the extent of moral hazards on the franchisor's and franchisee's sides and, more specifically, to various institutional parameters of the franchisor's country, namely, the legal tradition, the level of procedural formalism, the constraints imposed by labour regulation and the effectiveness of trademark protection. While agency theory parameters seem to perform rather badly in this international setting, institutions such as trademark protection and labour regulation have more explanatory power: greater trademark protection encourages franchising and the impact of labour regulation is mostly positive, depending on the type of labour regulation that is being considered. The effect of legal tradition and formalism seems negligible once these parameters are taken in. (c) Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.

I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper compares corporate governance principles in the U.S., UK, and Germany. The U.S. and UK represent shareholder models of ownership and control whereas in Germany a stakeholder approach to corporate governance provides greater input for creditors, employees and other groups affected by corporate decision making. Recent changes in the U.S. and UK as evidenced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and a variety of reports including the Cadbury Committee Report recognize the importance of a more independent board of directors, completely independent audit committee, and strong internal controls. In Germany, some of these initiatives have been suggested as well. The U.S. can learn from their British counterparts and endorse governance advances such as to separate out the role of the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. Other changes that would strengthen governance in the U.S. include to: limit the number of boards on which a person can serve; recognize the rights of stockholders to nominate directors; and give shareholders a more direct role in board oversight. The U.S. should consider adopting some of the German attributes in their governance system by incorporating employees and employee representative groups into the oversight process. After all, it was the employees that worked for Enron who suffered the most as a result of corporate fraud including a loss of jobs and the near wipe-out of their 401K retirement plans.

The replacement of a CEO is one of the control mechanisms that companies employ to reduce the agency problems. This paper divides companies into non-family businesses and family businesses and investigates the influence of outside directors, outside blockholders, and excess compensation in CEOs termination process. The samples used in the paper come from manufacturing companies in Taiwan listed between 1996-1997; the analytical method is logistic regression model. The conclusion is as follows: 1. the characteristics of family businesses, corporate governance, and excess compensation have no correlation on CEO turnover. 2. External board members play an important role in CEO termination in non-family businesses.

This paper discusses the governance issues in nonprofit organizations (NPO). The theoretical framework of agency theory is used to analyze the relationship between agents and principals (donors and volunteers) in such kinds of organizations. Similarly to the for-profit organizations, the mechanisms of incentives and monitoring are crucial to the alignment of interests among principals and agents. However, considering the NPO's intrinsic characteristics, due to the difficulty to implement external and internal governance mechanisms, the challenges of alignment are far more complicated. The NPOs are idiosyncratic, being in many situations complex to establish performance comparisons with similar organizations.

The recent financial crises have created a new debate about comparison and convergence of different systems of corporate governance. In particular, they have underlined poor efficiency of rule structures to achieve a good relationship between different stakeholder's rights. In line with many studies of corporate governance that emphasize the manager-stakeholders relationship as explained by agency theory, in this paper, I analyse the role of auditing as an incentive device to reduce contractual or transaction costs related to asymmetric information.Considering as a benchmark the recent US Sarbanes Oxley Act of July 2002. I describe a set of auditing principles by comparing common and civil corporate laws. First, by using multiple correspondence analysis on six countries and twenty-seven dummy variables on auditing rules, I identify the main variables that form the auditing index. Second, I test the hypothesis that a suitable rule structure can improve the capability of financial markets to estimate the fair value of firms. In particular, I analyse the problem of the effects of direct and indirect monitoring rules for managers on the market value of public companies. The results obtained highlight a different relationship between auditing principles and firm performance from that expected on the basis of the legal framework.

Firstly, from Transaction Costs, Property Rights and Agency perspectives, the economic rationale of mutuals is analyzed, paying particular attention to MATEP's peculiarities and incentives in terms of competition, regulation and ownership. Subsequently, the effectiveness of governance mechanisms is discussed, showing that the status quo leaves excess power in the hands of the managers of these organizations.

Family business researchers are split on whether family managers in family firms are agents or stewards. If family managers behave as agents, family firms are expected to impose agency cost control mechanisms on them, and this will improve performance. The results based on a sample of small privately held family firms indicate that family managers are monitored and provided with incentive compensation. Those who do so obtain higher performance, thus suggesting the existence of agency behavior among family managers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study examines the association between board composition and voluntary disclosure in annual reports. In particular, it addresses the incentives within the agency theory framework for both inside and independent directors to disclosure additional information voluntarily. Further, it provides evidence on the relation between the overall total voluntary disclosure and the components of voluntary disclosure, such as forward looking, strategic, non-financial and historical financial disclosures and board composition. Our sample is based on 181 Australian companies. We have developed and hand-collected 67 items from annual reports to develop the total voluntary disclosure index and the sub-indices of voluntary disclosure. Using two-stage multivariate analyses, our results provide some important insights. First, we find that there is a positive association between board composition and the voluntary disclosure of information in annual reports. Second, we also find that independent boards provide more voluntary disclosure of forward looking information and strategic information. However, board structure has no bearing on the voluntary disclosure of non-financial and historical financial information. Our findings are enhanced by different empirical specifications and sensitivity tests.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Differently from prior studies that examine the role of stand-alone control systems within the relationship between owners and managers, our study investigates the correlation between two control mechanisms - voluntary disclosure and independent directors - in companies characterized by the presence of a dominant shareholder that is supposed to mitigate the classical agency problem. Based on agency theory, we hypothesize that the two mechanisms tend to coexist, since the presence of either one reduces the costs of introducing the other. Two further effects - the reputation and the domino effect - contribute to determine a positive relationship between the two mechanisms. We carried out the empirical analysis on 175 non-financial Italian listed companies, all controlled by a dominant shareholder. Voluntary disclosure is measured through three alternative disclosure indexes. Independent directors are identified not only according to a formal/legal definition, but also through stricter criteria. The empirical test is based on a multivariate analysis controlling for size, residual ownership diffusion, leverage, profitability and labour pressure. Results support our hypothesis and are robust to alternative criteria to identify dominant shareholders. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between different control mechanisms in particular agency settings.

Business groups are the primary form of managing large business organizations outside North America. This paper provides a systematic and integrative framework for understanding business groups. We argue that existing theoretical perspectives of business groups pay attention to four critical external contexts, each of which draws from a specific theoretical perspective: market conditions (transaction cost theory), social relationships (relational perspective), political factors (political economy perspective), and external monitoring mechanisms (agency theory). Business groups adapt to these external forces by deploying various internal mechanisms along two key dimensions: one focuses on the distinctive roles of the group affiliates (horizontal connectedness) and the other focuses on coupling and order between the parent firm and its affiliates (vertical linkages). Based on these two dimensions, a typology of business group forms is developed: network (N-form), club (C-form), holding (H-form), and multidivisional (M-form). Utilizing this model we provide research questions which facilitate an improved future research agenda. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Challenging agency theory prescriptions for board composition, we contend that the boards of young firms that have recently gone public are best comprised of a majority of original top management team (TMT) members, rather than independent outsiders. We argue that such board members possess valuable tacit knowledge of the firms and their entrepreneurial visions and are in the best position to provide oversight. We additionally argue that outsiders should provide resources that firms' TMTs might use to execute their strategies, rather than monitor the TMTs. Our results from 1996-97 data on 524 initial public offerings support our contentions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This exploratory study is intended to analyze how a combination of the resources-based view and agency theory can provide a better understanding of the internal dynamic of the family business and its evolution. Our evidence seems to suggest that the desire to keep family control produces specific sources of value and conditions the firm's financial capacity to acquire resources. These peculiarities change between first and following generations. During the first generation, we find that less severe agency costs balance the negative effect of scarce financial structure on the family firm's value. After descendants join the firm, the increasing agency costs are compensated by the enlargement of the firm's financial structure. (c) 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

Drawing on three prominent views about the "self" and the self's relationship with "others", a typology of five parental altruistic archetypes is derived that exhausts the possible altruistic influences on the governance of family firms. When taken in concert, these five types comprise a more balanced explanation of the cross-sectional variance in the governance efficiency of these firms than do the explanations from agency theory and more recently, by Schulze and colleagues. Therefore, the typology provides an improved explanation of why some family firms are more able than others to capitalize on the family governance's positive attributes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides a definition of corporate governance and highlights the challenges in adapting understanding of governance to the privately-held firm. We emphasize the need to develop the scope of governance in privately-held firms beyond the traditional agency theory focus in the financial economics literature relating to large publicly-listed corporations. There is a need to draw on and integrate an array of theoretical perspectives from both economics and other social science disciplines as well. We present a schematic model of corporate governance which places the contributions presented in the special issue in context and which serves as a guide to highlighting gaps in the research base. We review the principal issues relating to corporate governance in privately-held firms which relate to: governance in different organizational contexts (institutional context; the industrial sector within which the firm finds itself, the ownership context of the firm, and the stage within the firm's life-cycle); the scope of corporate governance; and other internal governance mechanisms to be considered We identify areas for further research on corporate governance in privately-held firms with respect to processes of governance, organizational contexts, assumptions about the owners, executive remuneration, financial reporting, the nature of the dependent variable relating to the expected outcome of different approaches to governance and various methodological issues. We suggest a need to develop governance codes for privately-held firms that are flexible enough to take account of the different types of governance needs of firms at different stages in their life-cycle.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Equity financing is important in financing growth but its special features in small business have not been well addressed in the finance or entrepreneurship literature. Since many small firms have family involvement and research shows that family firms have both advantages and disadvantages in managing agency costs, how family involvement and agency issues interact to affect equity financing in small business is an important topic of research. This study examines the effects of family ownership and management on two dimensions of small business equity financing, the use of equity financing and the use of public equity financing within the agency theory of financing. The results show that family involvement and agency issues interactively and separately influence equity financing in small business. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We show how capital structure is influenced by the strength of shareholder rights. Our empirical evidence shows an inverse relation between leverage and shareholder rights, suggesting that firms adopt higher debt ratios where shareholder rights are more restricted. This is consistent with agency theory, which predicts that leverage helps alleviate agency problems. This negative relation, however, is not found in regulated firms (i.e., utilities). We contend that this is because regulation already helps alleviate agency conflicts and, hence, mitigates the role of leverage in controlling agency costs.

Purpose The effect of corporate governance on firm performance has long been of great interest to financiers, economists, behavioural scientists, legal practitioners and business operators. Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design-methodology-approach A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations-implications The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality-value The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests.

We analyse the effects of different types and concentration of ownership on performance using a large population of firms in the Czech Republic after mass privatization. Specifications based on first-differences combined with instrumental variables show that the performance effects of different types and concentration of ownership are limited when compared to earlier studies. Often, concentrated ownership has a positive effect, a finding that supports the agency theory. The positive effect of foreign ownership is detected primarily for majority ownership and for ownership by foreign industrial firms. The state as a holder of the golden share has a positive effect on employment and sometimes, also on output and profitability. Overall, our results highlight the benefits of strategic restructuring accompanied by an inflow of new capital and managerial culture.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine whether or not divident policy is influenced by the firm's corporate control structure, investigating the relationship between the dynamics of earnings payout and the voting power enjoyed by different types of shareholders. This allows one to test a set of hypotheses derived from agency and pecking order theories. Design/methodology/approach - A large panel of UK firms for the 1990s and is analyzed that the payout policy is significantly related to control concentration. The problem of control measurement is addressed and the use of Banzhaf indices advocated as a relevant measure of voting power in the analysis of corporate policy choices. The traditional framework proposed by Linter is extended and an econometrically sound approach to modeling the dynamics of the total payout suggested. Where most - even recent - studies on payout policy show some methodological flaws, state-of-the-art dynamic panel data estimation procedures are applied. Findings - Expectedly, profitability is a crucial determinant of payout decisions, but the presence of strong block holders or block holder coalitions weakens the relationship between the corporate earnings and the payout dynamics. Block holders appear to realize that an overly generous payout may render the company liquidity constrained, and, consequently, result in suboptimal investment policy. Practical implications - The results challenge some of the implications of the agency theories of payout, and favor a pecking-order explanation for the observed patterns. The analysis of payout dynamics reveals also that companies adjust payout policies to changes in earnings only gradually, which is consistent with "dividend smoothing". In fact, the results suggest a presence of a more general phenomenon of the "total payout smoothing". Originality/value - According to one's bet knowledge, this is the first study employing those game theory-based concepts in the context of corporate payout policies.

This paper models the corporate ownership and performance relationship in Bangladesh listed firms using a simultaneous equations approach. Consistent with contemporary literature a "reverse-way" causality relationship between the two is documented. Using an unbalanced pooled sample of 660 firm-years, our results suggest that ownership does not have a significant impact on performance (Tobin's Q or ROA). However, performance does appear to have a significant negative impact on ownership. With few exceptions, other governance and control variables appear to have significant effects on both performance and ownership. These results imply that despite significant governance differences between Bangladesh and developed market economies there are strong similarities in "internal governance mechanisms" and the implications of agency theory.

We examine shareholder wealth effects in a heterogeneous sample of 115 European leveraged going private transactions from 1997 to 2005. Average abnormal returns as reaction to the LBO announcement amount to 24.20%. In cross-sectional regressions, we find that these value gains can largely be attributed to differences in corporate governance: on a macro level, abnormal returns for pre-LBO shareholders are larger in countries with a poor protection of minority shareholders. On a firm level, companies with a high pre-LBO free float and comparatively weak monitoring by shareholders tend to show high abnormal returns. Furthermore, companies that are undervalued with respect to an industry peer-group exhibit higher announcement returns, indicating that agency conflicts and/or market inefficiencies can serve as an explanation.

Research on the efficacy of stock-based compensation for outside directors has documented a weak or non-existent relationship with firm performance. Other variables also influence the relationships between these two constructs. Consistent with agency theory, we show, for a sample of 450 Standard & Poor 500 firms over the 1995-97 period that the use of director stock options and grants ratios was more strongly associated with positive performance in firms with (a) higher investment opportunities, and (b) weaker external monitoring. These findings have implications for compensation committees in the structuring of director compensation. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

The purpose of this study is to test cost management behavior of small restaurant firms and identify whether managers of these small restaurants behave differently depending on their management and ownership structure. The sample was comprised of 87 small restaurant firms identified from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). Cost of doing business, size of staff, and five performance measures were used as dependent variables. Independent variables included management and ownership type. Study findings identified significant differences in the profit margin depending on management type and ownership percentage of the primary owner. We also find that the cost of doing business (total expenses) varies depending upon single-family majority/minority ownership and the ownership percentage of the primary owner. The results support the notion that small restaurant firms are operated differently depending on their management and ownership structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Negative changes in lending terms could create a worse financial crisis for the small business than that faced by the firm from not getting the loan in the first place. This study examines the drivers of such negative changes using an agency perspective. Agency theory predicts that a borrowing firm's access to debt financing depends on its ability to deal with the agency problems between lender and borrower arising from asymmetric information. Using data collected by Industry Canada, this study found that dealing with agency issues decreases the likelihood that the credit terms of a small business will change adversely. Thus, we show the importance for the small business to develop and improve continually its resources for minimizing agency problems between the firm and its lender. (c) 2007, Copyright CCSBE/CCPME.

Can a stock exchange improve corporate governance and transparency by designating companies that exhibit superior corporate governance? In 2000, the Borsa Italiana created a mid-cap segment with strong listing standards, which is composed of firms (called STARS) that follow stricter standards of transparency, disclosure, monitoring and liquidity. We find that STAR firms exhibit governance characteristics not observed in non-STAR firms, such as a higher incidence of audit and executive committees and higher debt ratios. They experienced a modestly favorable share price response upon the implementation of the STAR initiative. Moreover, they experienced significantly higher buy and hold returns and transparency after the initiative. Several governance characteristics are cross-sectionally associated with performance following the STAR initiative. Overall, the results suggest that firms may be willing to improve governance when they are endorsed by a credible agency for doing so, and such improvements may lead to better performance. The STAR initiative may serve as a model that can be adapted by other stock exchanges to promote transparency and governance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper studies secrecy in voting and the role of information on coalition building in corporate governance. It finds evidence that supports the coalition building hypothesis and, in part, rejects the agency cost hypothesis. The conditions for insiders and large outsiders to form coalitions are examined. The results are consistent with insiders and large outsiders cooperating and voting as a block to maintain power, this imposes costs on other shareholders. Consistent with the agency theory and the coalition building theory, management initiated amendments have a more negative impact than shareholder initiated amendments. The Vote Your Conscience theory is rejected.

Using data on all family owned firms listed on the Italian Stock Exchange for the entire period between 2001 and 2005, it is shown that agency theory prescriptions and monitoring activities differentially impact the market value and profitability of family owned firms. Specifically, nonfounder family firms benefit from a low level of board and insider stock ownership and a high level of stockholder and foreign investor ownership, because these firms necessarily face high agency costs. Conversely, founder family firms benefit from a high level of board and insider ownership, and a low level of stockholder and foreign investor ownership, owing to their lower agency costs.

We develop our theoretical framework from the viewpoint of the information asymmetry and the agency theory that the Chinese mutual funds exhibit herd behaviour, and provide empirical evidence by using cross-sectional data of all the Chinese mutual funds between 1999 and 2003. We find that the Chinese mutual funds show overall herding, buy herding and sell herding, and the degree of sell herding is higher than that of buy herding. The degree of Chinese herding is higher than their US counterpart from all the three perspectives. This may be largely due to the institutional factors rather than those firm-specific factors that influence the US mutual funds investment decision. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although agency theory argues that there is a direct relationship between ownership patterns and performance, the empirical evidence to date has been mixed. However, previous studies have focused on samples of large mature firms in a single country. Combining agency and institutional perspectives, this paper examines performance effects of two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) and ownership concentration in firms that have recently undergone an IPO in the UK and France. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 242 matched IPOs in the two countries, it argues that legal institutions can moderate the effects of different types of owners and ownership concentration on performance. Our findings support the argument that concentrated ownership impacts performance, but this effect is stronger in France. Second, it is shown that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, but this impact is found to be influenced by the legal institutions in the given country.

A large conceptual economic literature presents assumptions that family owned and controlled firms perform better than others, essentially on the basis of agency theory, ownership structure, cultural specificities and particular management practices. Large empirical evidence has been supplied by various studies, even if there are still contradictory debates. This paper uses the paired samples methodology to compare operational, economic and financial profitabilities of Belgian family firms. Evidence is given that they perform better, and this significantly for economic profitability. Discussion is engaged about the contribution of family values and practices to their results.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the connection between earnings management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We argue that earnings management practices damage the collective interests of stakeholders; hence, managers who manipulate earnings can deal with stakeholder activism and vigilance by resorting to CSR practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a multi-national panel sample of 593 firms from 26 countries between 2002 and 2004, we find a positive impact of earnings management practices on CSR; this relationship holds for different robustness checks. Also, we demonstrate that the combination of earnings management and CSR has a negative impact on financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study draws on a generalized agency theory where managers are seen as the agents of all stakeholders and the earnings management literature to highlight that CSR can be used to garner support from stakeholders and, therefore, provides an opportunity for entrenchment to those managers that manipulate earnings. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the stakeholder perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policy makers and managers interested in enhancing CSR. For managers, our findings suggest that projecting a socially-friendly image in order to disguise earnings management cannot be sustained over time due to the detrimental effect on financial performance. In addition, this study provides a warning signal to policy makers that certain practices geared toward raising a firm's CSR may simply be a mechanism for hindering other devious practices.

Using panel data on 275 German exchange-listed companies I examine the relationship between founding-family ownership and firm performance. By separating the family effect from general blockholder effects, the paper shows that family firms are not only more profitable than widely-held firms but also outperform companies with other types of blockholders. However, the performance of family businesses is only better in firms in which the founding-family is still active either on the executive or the supervisory board. These findings suggest that family ownership is related to superior firm performance only under certain conditions. If families are just large shareholders without board representation, the performance of their companies is not distinguishable from other firms. In addition, the results indicate that other blockholders either affect firm performance adversely or have no detectable influence on performance measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use agency theory to examine the influence of ownership structure on the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, highlighting how that relationship might differ depending on the identity of the owners, and their potentially different interests. In doing so, we extend the scope of agency theory by examining the principal-principal conflicts of interests that may exist among different types of owners. Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms in R&D-intensive industries between 1998 and 2003, we find that financial slack has an inverted U-shaped relationship with R&D investments. Furthermore, that relationship varies depending on the presence of different types of owners. Family ownership positively moderates the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, whereas domestic institutional investors and foreign investors negatively moderate that relationship. Our results show that distinguishing among different types of owners is instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the nature of the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This is a cross-sectional study of the relation between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure in Ireland. Research Findings/Results: We report clear evidence that voluntary disclosure increases with the number of nonexecutive directors on the board. Firms that have a nonexecutive chairman make greater voluntary disclosures than other firms. This finding is not robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. We find no evidence that ownership structure is related to voluntary disclosure. Theoretical Implications: The results regarding nonexecutive directors are interpreted as independent boards facilitating a reduction in information asymmetry between owners and managers. While this supports the predictions of agency theory, the absence of evidence that ownership structure influences voluntary disclosure does not. It is posited that sociological and organizational factors (e.g., informal networking) that pervade the Irish market mitigate against our disclosure measure capturing all aspects of voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, indirect evidence is provided that there are other costs and benefits to disclosure that vary across firms and may outweigh agency costs in many situations. We conclude that while agency theory has some explanatory power for voluntary disclosure, it cannot explain all the cross-sectional differences in voluntary disclosure by Irish public limited companies. Practical Implications: The results support the attention paid by regulators to the proportion of nonexecutive directors on the board. However, the costs and benefits to disclosure vary across firms. Regardless of agency considerations and regulatory guidelines, firms will ultimately formulate their disclosure policy with reference to overall marginal costs and marginal benefits.

We contribute to multiple agency theory by examining cases in which ventures making initial public offerings (IPOs) have managerial agents on their boards whose goals conflict with those of the investment bank agents hired to underwrite the stock. Underwriters have an incentive to underprice IPOs to maintain strong ties with institutional investors. We develop theory on agent differences based on time horizons and risk taking by managerial agents as framed through behavioral agency theory. Examining governance mechanisms, we find both monitoring by board insiders and board experience decrease underpricing. Furthermore, underpricing increases when venture capitalists have prior ties with underwriters. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This article contributes to the social networks literature by examining how corporate governance factors influence CEOs' external advice-seeking behaviors. We incorporate insights from social networks research into an agency theory perspective to predict, and demonstrate empirically, that governance factors recommended by agency theory increase CEOs' tendencies to seek out advice contacts who are likely to offer perspectives on strategic issues that differ from their own; these advice-seeking behaviors ultimately enhance firm performance. Accordingly, this article also contributes to the corporate governance literature by describing how and why CEOs' advice networks mediate the effects of governance factors on firm performance.

Earnings management has been cast into negative light due to the recent corporate scandals and, therefore, is viewed as detrimental to the firm. Enron and Worldcom represent two of the most egregious cases of opportunistic earnings management that led to the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history. However, some argue that earnings management may be beneficial because it improves the information value of earnings by conveying private information to the stockholders and the public. We offer agency theory as a tool to distinguish between the opportunistic and beneficial uses of earnings management. The empirical evidence suggests that firms where earnings management occurs to a larger (less) extent suffer less (more) agency costs. Moreover, a positive relation is documented between firm value and the extent of earnings management. Taken together, the results reveal that earnings management is, on average, not detrimental.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics. Our study also adds to the understanding of business group restructuring in emerging economies. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

We argue that the norms underlying agency theory can be inappropriate for interpreting the ethicality of corporate governance decisions and behaviors of Russians because they were developed in countries with mature market-oriented economies. We posit that integrative social contracts theory has more explanatory power, taking into account two sets of often-conflicting values: traditional Russian values and market-oriented values. We describe three examples of ethical conflict in Russian corporate governance arising from these two sets of values and discuss implications for Western managers interacting with Russians in this crucial area of business activity.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the impact of corporate governance on the cash-holding policies of firms with different investment opportunities. It is difficult to determine the optimal level of cash holdings for "listed new economy" firms (firms in the computer, software, Internet, telecommunications, or networking industries), which require large amounts of capital for investment opportunities with high return potential. Unlike in "old economy" firms, for which investment opportunities are relatively limited, corporate governance in listed new economy firms may create shareholder protections that make investors willing to accept higher levels of corporate cash holdings. Research Findings/Results: By examining American Standard and Poor 1,500 companies, the evidence shows that CEO ownership and board independence affect the cash holdings in listed new economy and old economy firms differently. Specifically, higher managerial cash holdings tend to reduce cash holdings in old economy firms and higher board independence tend to increase cash holdings in listed new economy firms. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the association between agency theory and cash theories. Given different firm characteristics, the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings verifies the implication of agency theory in explaining corporate cash policy. Practical Implications: While firms in new economy industries may be eager for more flexible governance codes in order to maintain the freedom of decision making, the evidence from this study suggests that establishing effective governance mechanisms may, in turn, effectively enlarge the degree of freedom for these firms to make timely business decisions.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper aims at exploring the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the context of a small European capital market. Further developing existing literature, we acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of ownership by including both the fraction of shares owned by the five largest shareholders and the fraction of shares owned by management. Research Findings/Results: Using panel data for the period 2000-2003 with respect to the Italian market, we find that the ownership concentration of the five largest shareholders is beneficial to firm valuation. On the contrary, managerial ownership is beneficial only in non-concentrated firms, suggesting that the controlling owner may use his/her position in the firm to extract private benefits at the expense of the other shareholders by appointing managers that represent its own interest. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the agency theory and the managerial entrenchment argument. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for the ownership structure literature willing to reflect the diverging interests of different types of shareholders and to explore both endogeneity and non-linearity issues. Practical Implications: This study contributes to the recent debate on the effects of government regulations inspired by the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance in the small European countries. In questioning the alleged competitive superiority of the widely held company, our paper also suggests that the existence of good corporate law is not a sufficient condition for the development of a corporate economy resembling the US model.

Purpose - The relationship between the board characteristics (i.e. board independence, CEO duality, board size, board meeting and board tenure) and the ownership structure (i.e. managerial ownership, family ownership and institutional ownership) and earnings quality is examined. Design/methodology/ approach - Data from 280 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board for the year 2004 is used. Findings - Significant association was found between board tenure and earnings quality. In addition, a positive significant association was found between outside board ownership and family ownership and earnings quality. However no significant relationship was found between board of directors' independence and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications - The association between audit committees' characteristics and earnings quality was not examined. An examination of the impact of ownership structure on boards of directors and audit committees is warranted. An investigation of the impact of the ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia using separate test on family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms is suggested. Practical implications - The appropriateness of policy directives requiring majority independent directors may be considered by policy makers. Originality/value - The conflict of interest between outside shareholders and managers in a diffused ownership support the agency theory. However, utility of agency theory to explain the conflicts between the controlling owners and the minority shareholders where ownership concentration is prevalent is limited. Whilst demonstrating the dominant impact of ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia the study calls for alternative explanations of corporate governance practices in different institutional settings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this paper, we examine the determinants of the level of disclosure on corporate governance practices among European listed companies in the time period preceding the adoption of the European Union recommendations and Action Plan. Research Findings/Results: Using ratings on corporate governance disclosure issued by an independent rating agency we find that - ceteris paribus - the level of disclosure: (1) is lower for companies with higher ownership concentration; (2) is higher for companies from common-law countries; and (3) increases with the level of working capital accruals. Theoretical Implications: The results of the study support theoretical arguments that companies disclose corporate governance information in order to reduce information asymmetry and agency costs stemming from the separation between ownership and control, and to improve investor confidence in the reported accounting information. The study suggests various avenues for future research on corporate governance. Practical Implications: To policy makers and practitioners, the results suggest that a mandatory corporate governance disclosure requirement is abundant, and perhaps could even be inefficient. The results also indicate which types of companies can be expected to be least willing to comply with recent corporate governance disclosure requirements, and thus will need extra monitoring.

According to the agency theory, separation of ownership and control gives rise to manager's incentives to select and apply accounting estimates and techniques that can increase their own wealth. This issue has become more important in recent years as more firms are listed on stock exchanges as public firms. This study examines the association between the level of managerial ownership and earnings management activities, represented by the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals in Malaysian listed firms. The results show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with the magnitude of accounting accruals. However, this study finds that managerial ownership is less important in large-sized firms compared to small-sized firms. This finding suggests that large-sized firms demand and use better corporate governance mechanisms due to higher agency conflicts, and, therefore, less managerial ownership is needed for control. As part of the ownership structure, this study also examines the roles of block and foreign ownerships in relation to the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that corporate governance structures differ significantly across countries. Using agency theory and institutional theory, it examines how ownership structure and national culture influence the size and leadership structure of the corporate boards of multinational firms based in industrial countries. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The authors use ownership concentration, bank control, and state ownership to represent ownership structure. They view institutional structural norms as components of national culture and infer the nature of these norms for governance structure from Hofstede's national culture dimensions. Findings - The findings show that national culture has a dominant influence on corporate governance structure, and its emphasis is recommended in future cross-national organizational research. Research limitations/implications - Although the models were successful in explaining MNC board structure, the authors addressed only the effects of ownership structure and national culture. It is expected that these models could be improved by including national political and legal differences and additional national economic variables. Practical implications - The findings demonstrate that national cultures of the home countries of MNCs have powerful influences on their governance structures. Originality/value - This paper links national culture with governance structure. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue The relationship between board members and top executives is held central to corporate governance, yet studies of it are relatively few and our knowledge of its consequences is limited. This study aims to address how board-CEO relationships, in terms of power balance and social ties, contribute to the performance of new product introduction. It proposes a contingency view to highlight the context-dependent nature of such governance arrangements. Research Findings/Results Using survey and archival data in a sample of 198 industrial firms in Taiwan, this research finds that the two distinct types of board-CEO relationships relate curvilinearly to the performance of new product introduction. Furthermore, such universal relationships are moderated by market instability and board interlocks, respectively. Theoretical Implications: This study departs from the traditional agency view to an argument that fine-tuned board-CEO relationships, in light of sociopolitical and sociopsychological forces, and will serve as an essential enabling context for managerial risk taking. It demonstrates that research in this field should accommodate different theories to elaborate on the underlying tensions in the corporate governance and emphasize the merits of complementarity. Practical Implications: Acknowledging that good governance design softens managerial risk aversion, this study helps identify the governance conditions in which risk differentials between the board and CEO may align, and thus when exploratory efforts, in the form of new product introduction, are more likely to succeed.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

We survey the theoretical literature on privatization and efficiency by tracing its evolution from the applications of agency theory to recent contributions in the field of political economy. The former extend the theory of regulation with incomplete information to address privatization issues, comparing state-owned enterprises with private regulated firms. The benefits of privatization may derive either from the constraints it places on malevolent agents or from the impossibility of commitment by a benevolent government because of incomplete contracts. Contributions dealing with political economy issues separate privatization from restructuring decisions. They either explore bargaining between managers and politicians or analyse the impact of privatization shaped by political preferences on efficiency. The theoretical results regarding the relation between privatization and efficiency do not lead to any definitive conclusion. Privatization may increase productive efficiency when restructuring takes place whereas its effects on allocative efficiency still remain uncertain.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

After reviewing the literature surrounding the link between executive compensation and innovation activities of North American firms, we examine two gaps in the area. First, we analyze how contextual factors can affect CEO pay in high-technology companies. In particular, we study three contextual dimensions: political, economic, and social. Second, we consider the specific case of executive compensation in high-technology firms when family ties are present at the helm. Drawing on agency rationale and previous research, we develop a series of instrumental propositions intended to provide the theoretical basis for a future research agenda in the area.

Purpose - This paper aims at re-examining the predictions of agency theory with regard to the negative association between CEO duality (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, serves also as the board chairman) and corporate performance. It also examines the role of other corporate governance mechanisms (board size, top managerial ownership and institutional ownership) as moderating variables in the relationship between CEO duality and corporate performance. Methodology/approach - This paper uses the financial statements for the year 2006 of most actively traded Egyptian companies to examine these predictions of agency theory. Moderated Regression Analysis is used to analyse the empirical data.

This paper investigates valuation effects of share block transfers and employs agency theory to explain the determinants of equity block premia. A sample of transactions from Poland is used to measure benefits and costs of ownership concentration. Block premia are found to be remarkably low and comparable with those for the most developed economies. Shareholders expect to benefit from intensified monitoring and from corporate restructuring resulting from block acquisitions. Still, shareholders are wary of expropriation stemming from the extraction of private benefits of control by block holders. The opportunities to extract such benefits depend on relative power of investors. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Greatly changing scenarios are affecting how organizations must be managed, leading to the need for very efficacious, efficient governance and management systems. Nowadays, it is essential to examine the elements that organizational governance implies and to pay special attention to the relation between governance and the agency theory that is becoming vital in the seductive, complex topic of contemporaneous companies. This article broaches the theoretical bases of this issue, for the purpose of structuring a conceptual framework to organize the knowledge and scope of corporate governance and its alignment mechanisms, especially those related to the role of administration councils. The article ends by mentioning some papers on this matter, to give it a pragmatic approach.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

The literature indicates that, mainly in countries with high stock concentration, the ownership structure is an important internal mechanism of control of the corporate governance, with effects in the companies' value and performance. In Brazil, the existing relationship among corporate governance - ownership structure - performance is still not conclusive. The present study investigates if there is any relationship among ownership structure, financial performance and value in the Brazilian nonfinancial public companies with stocks negotiated in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, between the period of 1997 to 2001, as well as the determinant of the level of concentration of the ownership in these companies. In the empiric investigation it was used a multiple regression analysis through the estimators of the Ordinary Least Squares with heteroscedasticity in accordance with White (1980). Concerning the used methodology, the results indicate that the variables of ownership structure as defined do not have influence on the financial performance and value of the companies. Remaining to the determinant of the ownership structure of the Brazilian non-financial public companies, the results indicate that the ownership structure can be explained by the size of the firm, market instability and regulation, being the latter the main determinant of the ownership structure.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the relationship of concentration of shareholdings with the number of financial analysts following a firm to see if concentrated shareholders substitute for the monitoring activities of analysts. Research Findings/Results: Using a clean ownership dataset with a sample of 3,115 firm-year observations for U.S. firms and regression techniques that address any potential endogeneity, we find that analyst following is negatively related to the concentration of outsider and insider shareholdings. We find similar relations for changes in analyst following and changes in ownership concentration. Theoretical Implications: Our results support the argument that an outsider with a larger stake in a firm is more likely to produce its own in-house information for the monitoring of the firm's managers and avoid both the cost and moral hazard problems associated with analysts. The results also support the argument that if senior managers hold large stakes in the firm, there is a greater likelihood that managerial incentives will be aligned with those of other shareholders. Practical Implications: We contend that there is a governance substitution effect, with concentrated shareholders substituting for the monitoring activities of analysts. Our results are consistent with the opinion that regulators need not fear large shareholders. This is especially applicable to large outside shareholders as we find that the economic effect of concentrated outsider shareholdings is quite strong and greater than that of concentrated insider shareholdings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationship between dual-class share structure and the purchase of nonaudit services, and the extent to which the market's valuation of accounting information is influenced by the perception of auditing compromise resulting from such purchases. Research Findings/Results: Using a sample of Canadian companies from 2003-2004, we find that dual-class firms pay a larger amount of nonaudit fees to the auditors, relative to single-class firms, both in the absolute dollar amount and as a ratio of total audit fees. In addition, the returns-earnings association is significantly lower for dual-class firms than for their counterparts, and there is a further valuation discount as dual-class firms increase nonaudit service purchases. Theoretical Implications: We argue that severe agency problems inherent from the deviation from the one-vote-per-share structure lead to greater demand for economic bonding with the auditors via the purchase of nonaudit services. This study contributes to the growing body of nonaudit service literature by documenting the empirical link between ownership of control and nonaudit purchases. Practical Implications: The results indicate that investors believe a larger amount of nonaudit services highlights the underlying agency problems and compromises auditor independence for firms with a separation of cash flow rights and voting rights. The findings suggest that regulators in Canada and in other developed countries, when revising their future regulations on audit committees, may need to emphasize the role of restricted-class shareholders in bolstering the audit committee function and the auditing process.

This research argues that there is conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. The conflict also varies based on growth opportunities. This research argues that disciplinary role exist in debt policy with the use of free cash flow hypothesis. This research explores the implications of free cash flow hypothesis concerning the disciplinary role of ownership structure in corporate debt policy. Managerial ownership and internal institutional are other mechanism to reduce agency conflict also has a significant impact on debt policy (control coalition cohesiveness). The relationship between managerial ownership and debt policy is interdependence, as known as balancing of agency theory. This study uses 1264 observation of 154 listed Indonesian firms between the years 1995 until 2003. Three state least square (3SLS) model will be use for statistical and analytical purposes. This study developed several arguments. The relation between debt and free cash flow are positive, but the relation differs between low-growth firms and high-growth firms. Internal institutional shareholders discourage managerial perquisites using debt. The result of this research support the free cash flow hypothesis and balancing of agency theory through ownership and there is disciplinary role of ownership structure in debt policy.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

In this empirical study, the incidence of the shares transfers by the original shareholders on the degree of the initial underpricing is studied, using a sample of Tunisian candidates companies over the 1992-2006 period. Our empirical results make it possible to confirm the existence of a significant initial underpricing of about 19% and which depends closely on the behavior of shares transfer. More precisely, the original and the controlling shareholders, in order to limit the transfer of wealth towards the new shareholders, reduce the degree of IPO underpricing.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of alternative flotation methods on price performance of seasoned equity offerings, and to compare the competing hypotheses supported by asymmetric information theory and agency theory. Based on 385 sample issues which were listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2006, we find that the bookbuilding flotation method demonstrates significant positive abnormal returns for issuing firms, whereas the fixed-price method exhibits negative results. The empirical findings support the agency theory in the sense that the bookbuilding procedure offers a mechanism to strengthen the external monitoring provided by blockholders, which can subsequently reduce the agency cost and thus increase the share price. Further cross sectional analysis confirms this argument. The result of the study implies that the governments should take effective actions to help regulate agency problems in emerging markets such as Taiwan.

Building on agency and prospect theory views, many researchers have analyzed the executive risk-taking behavior. They have usually put in evidence the role of the mechanisms of corporate governance. In this research, we try to point out that even managerial entrenchment does matter. We consider the non financial firms that are listed in the Tunisian Stock exchange during the 1996 - 2006 period. To reveal the managerial risk taking, we apply factor analysis so as to construct a global index. To find out the impact of managerial entrenchment on risk-taking, we consider the ownership of the manager, his experience within the firm as well as his age. The size of the firm is also worth investigating while exploring managerial risk taking. The results are somewhat robust to different specifications. They may enhance and extend the agency-based corporate governance literature on executive risk-taking. But above all, they may shed some light on the emerging markets context namely the Tunisian one.

The attempt to align interests of executives with those of shareholders has been addressed in the corporate governance context from a predominantly economic outlook based on the agency theory. The models that combine monitoring and control systems in association with financial incentive mechanisms, such as profit and income sharing, stock options, bonds and other benefits, consider an individual to be individualist, opportunist and self-interested, diverging from the assumptions of other theories and contemporary ideas in the area of human resources management. Based on the criticism related to the agency theory, particularly when drawing up incentive schemes, this article aims to look at alternative theories to build corporate governance practices that include considerations on extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of agents.

In this paper I distinguish between the justificatory and explanatory roles of theory, and propose that the justificatory role played in the literature thus far by agency theory is subject to limitations. I therefore argue for the use of resource-dependence theory as the epistemological basis of the corporate governance domain knowledge system, and present an alternate model of corporate governance. Potential contributions of this alternate model are discussed.

This article analyses the governance theory of the New Institutional Economics. The objective is to establish a clear definition of the concept of "governance" and to show some of its economic applications. All the elements of that theory are explored, drawing a distinction between agency theory and transactions cost theory. Applying the theory to education in Colombia, it is concluded that the new forms of provision in education represent promising governance structures with respect to improvement in educational service, but confront challenges with regard to school choice and contractual design.

Based on the work of Berle and Means (1932), Coase (1937), Arrow (1971), and others, agency theory emerged in the 1970s to explain economic relationships under conditions of uncertainty and less-than-perfect information. It has become a widely used theoretical lens in strategic management research, with applications intended to inform research about corporate governance (Finkelstein and D'Aveni, 1994; Walsh and Kosnik, 1993), CEO compensation (Barkema and Gomez-Mehia, 1998), firm performance (Brush, Bromiley, and Hendrickx, 2000; Li and Simerly, 1998), firm risk (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998; Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998); and strategic decisions such as diversification (Kochhar, 1996; Markides and Singh, 1997) and mergers (Holl and Kyriazis, 1997; Reuer and Miller, 1997).

Many problems of corporate governance in Russia are beyond the scope of classical agency theory because of highly concentrated ownership structures. Using ownership and financial dataset from UBS Brunswick, we show that the use of accrual based accounting in Russia has resulted in lower informativeness of earnings. Opportunistic earnings management hypothesis holds where majority shareholders (controllers) enjoy short-term benefits of manipulating accounting numbers. Interestingly, the returns (net of market) increase when use of discretionary accruals to manage earnings increases in firms controlled by either state or oligarchs. However, such relationship does not exist when ownership is accumulated without control. We also found that state-owned companies use less discretionary accruals than other control groups. We do not find any evidence supporting performance measure hypothesis where firms manage earnings by discretionary accruals to offset the over or under reaction of economic shock. Highly leveraged firms tend to have positive relationship between earnings management and returns, whereas, both size and growth reflect negative informativeness of earnings. The results describe the concentrated ownership structure in Russia where controlling owners not only, achieve personal targets by over or under-statement of disclosed earnings but also get positive response from the market. This market benefit however, can only be achieved with effective control.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The goal of this paper is to meta-analyze the results of 35 studies that examine the effect on earnings management of firms' boards of directors and ownership structure. We examine whether differences in results are attributable to moderating effects related to the system of corporate governance, the measurement of the governance variable, or the particular specifications of discretionary accruals models. Research Findings/Insights: The findings show that the variation in the results of previous studies on CEO duality and audit committee independence are caused by sampling error. In addition, the measurement of dependent variable, discretionary accruals, and the corporate governance system moderate the association between earnings management and some corporate governance variables. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The measurement of variables, especially discretionary accruals, influences the findings found in previous studies. The findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the legal and institutional setting when one analyzes the effect of mechanisms of corporate governance on discretionary accruals. Future research should include matrix correlations, and consider detailed measures of earnings management and more attributes of boards of directors in order to facilitate research using meta-analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results suggest that board independence, board size, and audit committee independence can improve investor confidence by constraining earnings management. Additional empirical evidence regarding refined measures of ownership and board, specifically board independence, would be very useful in gaining greater understanding of how the different approaches to these constructs influence earnings management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand how business group affiliation, within firm governance and external governance environment affect firm performance in emerging economies. We examine two aspects of within firm governance - ownership concentration and board independence. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data on the top 500 Indian and Chinese firms from multiple data sources for 2007, we found that group affiliated firms performed worse than unaffiliated firms, and the negative relationship was stronger in the case of Indian firms than for Chinese firms. We also found that ownership concentration had a positive effect on firm performance, while board independence had a negative effect on firm performance. Further, we found that group affiliation - firm performance relationship in a given country context was moderated by ownership concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study utilizes an integration of agency theory with an institutional perspective, providing a more comprehensive framework to analyze the CG problems, particularly in the emerging economy firms. Empirically, our findings support, as well as contradict, some of the conventional wisdom, and suggest useful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study shows that reforms in general and CG reforms in particular are effective in emerging economies, which is an encouraging sign for policy makers. However, our research also suggests that it may be time for India and China to stop the encouragement for the empire building through group formation in the corporate world. For practioners, our findings suggest that firms need to balance the need for oversight with the need for advice, while selecting independent directors. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

There is considerable variation across countries in both the extent to which large publicly listed firms are family-owned and the dominance of such family-owned firms in stock markets. The literature presents competing theoretical viewpoints on what influences such country-level variation. On one hand, institutional economists suggest that institutional voids can have a strong influence. On the other hand, cultural sociologists suggest that a country's culture can have a strong influence. One type of institutional void is a lack of institutional norms and regulations needed for monitoring contracts (which can discourage owners from hiring professional agents for top management positions in their firms) and another type of institutional void is a lack of financial credit availability in the country. Cultural dimensions include collectivism (i.e. cohesion within in-groups/families) and power distance (i.e. inequalities in society). This country-level empirical study suggests that both national culture and institutional voids influence family ownership patterns around the world, and that institutional voids moderate the influence of national culture. National culture has a stronger influence when a country has institutional voids; however, the influence of national culture weakens when institutional voids are overcome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

Agency theory posits that the greater degree of control by those with decision-making authority, the greater the overall organizational performance. Conversely, entrenchment theory implies that at extremely high levels of inside control by those with decision authority, organizational performance decreases. Using a nationwide sample of 2,631 privately held and publically traded family businesses, we examined if the relationship of percent family ownership is an agency or entrenchment relationship and found the latter. Specifically, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between percent of family control and sales growth as well as a strong inverse relationship between percent of family controlling the top management team and all measures of financial performance.

Drawing on agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, we develop arguments relating equity ownership structures and CEO compensation mix to a firm's choice of foreign market entry modes. Based on a sample of 432 foreign market entries by 118 non-diversified firms in the US manufacturing sector between 1991 and 1998, our findings indicate that greater equity ownership by institutional shareholders and inside directors is positively associated with a preference for full-control entry modes. In addition, our results suggest that CEOs with a greater proportion of pay tied to firm long-term performance are more inclined to choose full-control entry modes over shared-control modes.

In a broad sense, corporate governance is about how firms should be governed so that they are run effectively and efficiently. This paper takes a broad perspective on corporate governance mechanisms and considers possible synergies between corporate governance and international business (IB) research. We summarize the papers included in this Focused Issue, and draw out their main contributions to the literature. In so doing, we compare and contrast the four theoretical perspectives concerning corporate governance and IB adopted in the five papers: i.e. transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, agency theory, and institutional theory. Finally, we highlight five research themes (international diversification, business groups, entry modes, subsidiary mandates, and new international ownership structures) where future work explicitly addressing governance issues may prove fruitful.

The current literature frequently examines the effects of shareholder rights protection on corporate cash holdings in the context of agency theory. In this study, we show that national culture influences corporate managers' cash holding behavior beyond the effects of corporate governance and financial market developments in each country through the perception of agency costs and value of financial flexibility. Using Hofstede's cultural dimension indices, we find that corporations hold larger cash and liquid balances in countries where the people tend to avoid uncertainty more, are culturally more masculine, and have longer term orientation.

Drawing on the agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, the authors link board characteristics and managerial incentives to the choice between acquisitions and joint ventures by firms entering foreign markets. Hypothesized relationships are examined in the context of 383 acquisition and 171 joint venture entries undertaken by relatively nondiversified firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1991 to 1999. Findings indicate that firms with boards characterized by a higher proportion of outside directors and independent leadership structures (i.e., the absence of duality) are more inclined to favor acquisitions over joint ventures in foreign market entry. Likewise, the data reveal that firms where insiders have greater equity ownership and compensation structures that are more closely linked to long-term firm performance prefer acquisitions over joint ventures. Implications of the findings along with directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2009 Southern Management Association.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether ownership concentration affects board and audit committee independence, and whether the impact of board and audit committee independence on firm value is moderated by ownership concentration and dividend payouts. Research Findings/Insights: Using panel data on a sample of Australian publicly listed firms over the period 2000-2005 (1,530 firm-year observations), the study finds that ownership concentration has a negative impact on board independence, but no impact on audit committee independence. Results also suggest that board independence enhances firm value and that performance impact of board independence is stronger in closely-held firms and/or firms having low dividend payouts. A marginally positive impact of audit committee independence, especially among closely-held firms, is also found. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the impact of governance mechanisms is moderated by companies' ownership structure and dividend policies. It extends research on the effectiveness of governance mechanisms by distinguishing two types of agency problems and using a simultaneous equations model. The findings underline the important governance role that independent boards and audit committee can play in a country that has high ownership concentration and high levels of private benefits of control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of this study strengthen the idea that independent directors can also play a key role in the governance of closely-held firms. As such, for investors, as far as agency costs are concerned, investments in closely-held firms that have a higher proportion of independent directors on the board and audit committee are sensible. Closely-held firms should be aware of the investor's need for more independent directors, especially when dividends are low. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationships between initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, CEO duality, and strategic ownership in 12 Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Research Findings/Results: Using all IPOs from January 2000 until the end of July 2007, we document an average IPO underpricing of 184.1 per cent. Underpricing is higher in IPO firms that have CEO duality. However, strategic shareholders, such as corporations and other industry-related investors, are likely to play a monitoring role whereas underpricing is found to be lower in firms with both CEO duality and strategic shareholder ownership. Moreover, the negative relation between underpricing and strategic blockholding is greater for foreign strategic ownership than it is for domestic strategic ownership. Theoretical Implications: This paper examines the level and determinants of IPO underpricing in the MENA region. It provides evidence on the role played by foreign strategic owners in reducing agency conflicts and information asymmetries within an environment where firms may be affected by the cultural issues related to political ties and family involvement. Practical Implications: Our results contribute to the existing debate on the appropriate regulations for an effective and stable financial system in Arab countries. They offer policy-makers additional evidence on the positive impact of market openness to foreign shareholders. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Prior to China's split-share structure reform, domestic A shares were divided into non-tradable and tradable shares. Non-tradable shareholders represent the government, hold roughly a two-thirds majority, and manage the firms, while tradable shareholders have little power to affect the decisions made by non-tradable shareholders. This is a typical structure to exhibit agency problems. The 2005 structure reform program stipulates that non-tradable shareholders have to bargain with tradable shareholders in order to gain liquidity. The price that non-tradable shareholders pay to tradable shareholders for gaining liquidity is defined as "compensation." We explore the issue of why corporate governance might play an important role in affecting the level of compensation. Research Findings/Insights: Firms with a weak governance structure or severe agency problems are required to have a higher level of compensation. The level of compensation is positively correlated with the non-tradable shareholding, the pledge ratio, and related-party transactions, and is negatively correlated with foreign shareholdings. The same set of variables dictates the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shareholders, but in the reverse direction. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The share reform provides a natural setting that allows tradable shareholders to reflect their concerns with agency problems. The mechanism could ameliorate the agency problems. Corporate governance, in a broad sense, is related to compensation and the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shares. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A successful mechanism should be designed to have minority shareholders involved in the process and have the final compensation reflect the quality of corporate governance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study distinguishes between the effects of financial constraint determinants on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and domestic M&As for all takeover bids announced in nine East Asian economies from 1998 to 2005. Research Findings/Insights: The results of logistic regressions verify that the extent of stock market and governance developments improves corporate financing conditions and subsequently encourages cross-border M&As in East Asia. The results also indicate that, except for ownership control variables, the firm-specific factors of financing constraints reduce the occurrence of cross-border M&As relative to domestic M&As. Although family-and state-controlled firms have better access to external financing, they are reluctant to risk diluting their management control and thus prefer domestic M&As to cross-border deals. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study enhances the empirical studies of the relation between financing constraints and corporate investments based on the market imperfection hypothesis of corporate finance theories. In addition, this study also addresses the interaction between the market imperfection hypothesis and agency theory in explaining the effects of special ownership control on cross-border M&As relative to domestic deals. Furthermore, by examining the research questions across nine East Asian economies, this study provides an understanding of how such a relation applies to firms in countries where information asymmetry is high. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings indicate the importance of corporate governance and verify the effects of unique organizational structures on major corporate decisions. Specifically, family-controlled firms are often free of the financing constraints inherent in investment decisions. Thus, it is necessary to consider such organizational uniqueness when explaining the financing behavior of cross-border M&As conducted by Asian firms. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

Motivated by agency theory, we explore the potential impact of managerial entrenchment through staggered boards on dividend policy. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards are more likely to pay dividends. Among firms that pay dividends, those with staggered boards pay larger dividends. We also show that the impact of staggered boards on dividend payouts is substantially stronger (as much as two to three times larger) than the effect of all other corporate governance provisions combined. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the notion that dividends help alleviate agency conflicts. Thus, firms more vulnerable to managerial entrenchment, i.e., firms with staggered boards, rely more on dividends to mitigate agency costs. Aware of potential endogeneity, we demonstrate that staggered boards likely bring about, and are not merely associated with, larger dividend payouts. Our results are important, as they show that certain governance provisions have considerably more influence than others on critical corporate activities such as dividend payout decisions.

Purpose - This paper aims to compare the cost efficiencies across bank-and market-based EU countries for the different groups of commercial, savings and co-operative banks; and between listed and non-listed banking institutions. In addition, it attempts to determine any potential implications for bank efficiency originating from differences in financial structure. Design/methodology/approach - Efficiency scores are estimated using the Battese and Coelli's time-varying stochastic frontier approach. The classification of bank- and market-based financial systems is based on the World Bank's Financial Structure Database. Findings - On the whole the results reject the agency theory hypothesis that managers of privately-owned banks are more cost efficient than those of mutual banking institutions because of capital market devices as it is found that mutual banks operating in EU-15 countries are significantly more cost efficient than commercial banks. Furthermore, results are mixed concerning the financial structure hypothesis that in developed financial systems bank efficiency should not be statistically different across bank-vs market-based economies. Research limitations/implications - The analysis suggests that differences in cost efficiency across bank types can often be explained by the prevailing financial system in each economy. Practical implications - The evidence illustrates the national diversity of corporate governance systems in Europe and can be important to policy makers who are concerned with the full integration of the European financial system. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no previous similar empirical works for the EU banking sector. Such a study has important policy implications especially due to the fact that the EU banking sector is experiencing profound structural changes and a full integration has not yet been achieved.

Our study investigates differences in CEO turnover between focused and diversified firms to determine whether diversification strategies are necessarily associated with governance efficiency in family businesses. We find that large family CEO firms are more likely to engage in corporate diversification than are small non-family CEO firms and their CEOs are seldom replaced. Large family CEO diversified firms also have lower turnover sensitivity relative to focused firms. The results imply that the CEOs of diversified firms have entrenched themselves, thereby increasing agency costs within family businesses. However, we fail to find diversification discounts in family businesses. It is interesting that CEOs tend to diversify their businesses in order to decrease firm risk. Founding families favor risk reducing decisions in order to maintain family wealth and prestige; suggesting that family businesses are more interested in survival than growth. Although family businesses may benefit from risk reduction, a negative relationship between diversification level and CEO turnover is still evidence of poor corporate governance. Agency theory may not completely account for the adoption of diversification strategies in family businesses and corporate diversification may weaken the effectiveness of internal monitoring mechanisms.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article examines empirically the effect of ownership structure on the corporate financing decision from the agency theory perspective. This article contributes to the literature by examining the static and the dynamic effects of managerial insiders and large shareholders' ownership on the capital structure. Based on panel data analysis for a sample of Jordanian industrial firms during the period 2001 to 2005, the study provides empirical evidence indicating that the debt ratio is negatively related to managerial ownership and inconclusively related to individual block-holders' ownership. Moreover, the study finds no significant relationship between debt ratio and institutional ownership. These results are consistent with the entrenchment behaviour of managers and passive monitoring by institutions. Finally, supporting the results of previous literature, this study reveals that the capital structure is affected by firm's profitability, size and growth. (c) 2009 Taylor & Francis.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the relative success of collectively owned enterprises (COEs) in China during the early years of reform, but they have ignored the agency problems inherent in this type of organizational form that may be an obstacle to further improving performance in a changing environment. Drawing on agency theory and the privatization literature, we argue that the transformed COEs in the ongoing organizational transformation process may achieve better performance by reducing agency costs. We examine a sample of COEs in Chinese manufacturing industries and track their ownership statuses from 2000 to 2005. Our findings reveal that the transformed firms achieved better performance than the traditional, untransformed COEs by mitigating agency problems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Management and organization literature has treated conflicts in numerous times and from various perspectives. Still, the theoretical literature holds different views about the essence of owner-manager relationship, including the view that the top manager and the owner are seen as subjects with different goals and interests. And these differences may cause conflicts created within this relationship. The research question here is about the subject of CSR as an enhancing factor in the deepening of special interests of the owners and the managers, as well as in emphasising their different roles. The in-depth interviews contained 60 questions and were recorded. With nearly all questions, two aspects were addressed: on the one hand, the difference between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, and on the other, between enterprises based on foreign and domestic capital. By the beginning of the former period - that is 1995 - the privatisation period in Estonia was predominantly over and the first legislative framework concerning the operation of corporations in the Western sense started to develop. The second turning point is represented by the year 2000, when the "purge" following the Asian and Russian crises presented new demands on economic activities and economic thinking as a whole. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed: 7 owners, 12 top managers and 6 of those who had been both as owners and top managers. This article concentrates on the results that concern the possible sources of conflict between the managers and the owners and their perception of social responsibility and the links between those questions. When summing up the opinions of the interviewees it should be admitted that the responses reflected the insignificance of the conflicts issue rather than their serious topicality. As the respondents remarked on several occasions, the existence of owner-manager conflicts is not considered normal or built-in; as the respondents added, this should not be considered such. Thus the claim of built-in conflicts in the owner-manager relations, derived from the agency theory (at least the classical agency theory) should be questioned according to the responses of the Estonian owners and managers. At the same time this does not mean that the responses coincide with the standpoints of stewardship theory, because the results of the interviews do not enable to make general conclusion that Estonian managers tend to act in the best interest of their principals. The results of the interviews lead us to conclude that the difference between the way top managers and owners understand ideas and activities is quite clearly presented in the context of social responsibility; despite the fact that the respondents usually do not admit the existence of conflicts when discussing them in general. When comparing the opinions of the owners and top managers about social responsibility, considering the theoretical literature, we may claim to certain extent that owners and managers have a different perception of social responsibility and this leads to the conflicts between them. To conclude, the authors present the understanding that the context of CSR brings out the conflicts between managers and owners more clearly, or even intensifies the conflicts between them. Results from an empirical study, undertaken in Estonia, are used.

By employing the theoretical template provided by agency theory, this article contributes a detailed clinical analysis of a large multinational Canada-headquartered telecommunications company, Nortel. Our analysis reveals a twenty-first century norm of usual suspects: a CEO whose compensation is well above those of his peers, a dysfunctional board of directors, acts of income smoothing to preserve the confidence of volatile investors, and revelations of financial irregularities followed by a downfall. In many ways, the spectacular rise and - sudden - fall of Nortel illustrates excesses of actors within, and contradictions of the system of corporate governance implied by the agency model. Furthermore, this case illustrates limitations of the agency framework in complex situations with short-term oriented investors. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The relationship between managerial share ownership and the firm's change in leverage around a security issuance is examined. We find that entrenched managers are not more likely to issue equity, however they do affect lower leverage by choosing debt issuances which are smaller and equity issuances that are larger than those chosen by managers that are not entrenched. The magnitude of the decline in leverage that occurs from before the issuance to after the issuance is positively related to managerial share ownership. In addition, this relationship is confined to only the "entrenchment" range of managerial share ownership. The market reacts negatively to an issuance announcement when managerial share ownership is high. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper examines the firm specific characteristics - as a proxy for positive accounting research - that are associated with the propensity of companies listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE) to comply with the newly harmonised Egyptian Accounting Standards (EASs) issued in 1997 and that are close to the international accounting standards (IASs). Although having an international audit firm is the dominant factor associated with disclosure and measurement/presentation compliance, ownership concentration, share trading, size as measured by market capitalisation and internationality are also associated with compliance. However, the results show that profitability, liquidity and leverage do not seem to affect the extent of compliance with EASs and the performance of manufacturing are at par with non-manufacturing firms. Also the performance of private sector firms is at par with public sector firms. This may indirectly imply that the positive accounting perspective may not be entirely applicable for de facto compliance in Egypt. Hence, it cannot be entirely inferred that listed Egyptian companies may use de facto compliance with EASs as a means of reducing agency costs, raising capital, reducing political costs or signalling to the market that they are high quality firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the Agency Theory in order to understand the true nature of the corporation by determining the respective roles of shareholders and directors/managers within a corporation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares the economists' depiction of the firm with the legal conception of the corporation. It then analyses the legal concept of ownership and proves that the shareholders are the owners of their shares only and not of the corporation which is a separate legal person. The theories of corporation and relevant case law are also analysed. Findings - The analysis reveals that currently there are two distinct models of the corporation. The economists view a firm in terms of a nexus of contracts like a partnership where shareholders are the owners of the firm and the directors/managers are their agents. The law, on the other hand, regards the corporation as a separate legal entity with rights and liabilities of a natural person that is not subject to ownership. This doctrine of legal personality is the grund norm of corporate law from which other principles like limited liability, perpetual succession, transferability of shares and independent board are derived. However, both economic and legal models converge upon the purpose of corporation i.e. maximization of shareholders value. Originality/value - The paper highlights the distinction between economic and legal models of the firm. It points out that from a legal perspective, neither the shareholders are the principals nor the managers are their agents as proposed by the Agency Theory. The economists assume conflict of interests between the shareholders and directors and devise mechanisms to reduce agency costs. Law, on the other hand, determines manifestly the rights and liabilities of each participant in corporate structure. The directors owe their duties to the corporation and manage it without interference from the shareholders. Such arrangement is a product of historical process and qualifies a corporation as a sui generis form of business organization. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study aims to evaluate the suitability of Taiwan's minimum shareholding requirement for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to examine whether stewardship theory and both incentive and entrenchment effects can characterize the ownership-performance relationship simultaneously. Research Findings/Results: We apply new empirical methods to a balanced panel dataset including 496 firm-level observations of 62 Taiwanese SMEs publicly traded from 1999 to 2006. The results show a nonlinear ownership-performance relationship, first negative then positive, with a single threshold value of insider ownership (5.4 per cent). This indicates that both effects combine and that the current regulated minimum level of insider shareholdings for public SMEs may be too high. Theoretical Implications: Our evidence supports both convergence-of-interests and entrenchment effects and suggests a better specification that prevents spurious relations obtained from traditional methods. The stewardship theory does work in Taiwan. Insiders behave as loyal stewards rather than motivated by desire for entrenchment. Our empirical evidence suggests an avenue of future research, specifically to form better strategies for those involved in corporate governance. Practical Implications: We suggest that Taiwanese authorities should lessen ownership obligations, thereby leading to improved corporate governance by increasing the independence of the boards of directors. Emerging markets can learn from the Taiwan experience and then formulate their own regulations. Publicly traded SMEs could offer compensation to insiders such as stock options and performance shares. Asymmetric information problems often experienced by outside stockholders and foreign investors can be alleviated by these signals of insider ownership. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

Remuneration is considered to be closely connected with financial performance (positively), firm size (positively), the organizational structure (negatively) and corporate governance mechanisms (negatively). Furthermore, a connection of ownership structure and executives' remuneration has been well established (theoretically and empirically) in the literature (agency theory). The paper examines if these relationships are valid in Greece. Greece hasn't the characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon country. Overall the study has shown that remuneration levels in Greece are defined by a different set of factors than the ones that are prominent in an Aglo-Saxon country. Notably, fundamental financial measures of performance are more widely used. The age of firms and corporate governance quality have a catalytic impact on remuneration levels.

During the 1980s and 1990s the argument that "maximizing shareholder value" results in superior economic performance came to dominate the corporate governance debates. In this paper, I outline the rationale for the shareholder-value perspective, and show that, rooted in agency theory, it lacks a theory of innovative enterprise. Hence it cannot be used to analyze the conditions under which the stock market supports or undermines the process of value-creation. To go beyond agency theory and its shareholdervalue perspective, I present a framework for analyzing the functions of the stock market in the business corporation and the influence of these functions on the social conditions of innovative enterprise. I then use this framework to explain why in the United States since the 1990s there has been a widespread trend in corporate stock repurchases, including a sharp acceleration in buybacks since 2003. Focusing on a list of the largest corporate repurchasers in the United States, I raise questions concerning the relation between stock buybacks and value-creating investments in the US economy as a whole. I conclude with a discussion of why companies do stock repurchases, and in particular whether they can be justified as a contribution to innovative enterprise. I argue that the ultimate justification for stock repurchases is the ideology of "maximizing shareholder value" - an ideology that works to the direct benefit of corporate executives who make corporate resource allocation decisions and who derive high levels of remuneration from munificent stock option awards.

The rationale for the lively interest in corporate governance is the belief that there is a relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. A "good" governance-system is supposed to have a positive impact on performance. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of empirical work on the link between corporate governance and firm performance. It finds that there are neither clearly positive nor negative effects that can be identified. In the discussion, various reasons for the inconsistent findings are evaluated. Besides methodological problems and inadequate theoretical foundations, the neglect of institutional complementarities, demographic factors and group decision processes are considered. In conclusion, the relevance of structural elements of corporate governance appears to be overrated. The differences within and between highly developed governance-systems are too small to exert a significant impact on firm performance. (c) Rainer Hampp Verlag.

The paper finds that all of the investigated Asian economies issued new corporate governance codes to promote best practices in the Anglo-Saxon model after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. In our sample, the majority of listed firms in Asia implement a separate CEO/chairperson position and appoint a significant number of non-executive directors on the board. The result of this study also indicates that the prediction of the agency theory is valid under the Asian context. Using the combined sample of all Asian economies, we find that ownership concentration has a positive relation on firm performance and the controlling shareholder's ownership has a decreasing positive link with firm value. In addition, firms with a board dominated by non-executive directors are associated with higher performance, and smaller boards are linked with better performance. The paper also finds that the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model is more effective in Asian countries adopting the continental law system and without the influence of Confucian values.

This article documents significant improvements in the quality of corporate governance in Estonian listed firms between 1999 and 2007. Basing our approach in the agency theory framework, we construct a corporate governance index reflecting the specificities of transition economies in general and Estonia in particular. We base our index on best practice using a number of widely recognised sources. Using hand-collected publicly available data for 1999 and 2007, we calculate a corporate governance score for every listed company. Comparing the scores, we find an overall improvement in corporate governance during the period, which coincided with Estonia's accession to the EU. We find evidence that some corporate governance practices are better in cross-listed firms and those which were already in existence in 1989 and which were subsequently privatised. We identify some areas of corporate governance where practices could be enhanced.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and audit quality on risk taking in the U.S. property casualty insurance industry. The evidence shows that some corporate governance variables, as well as some audit quality variables are related to risk taking. We find that longer board tenure is associated with low underwriting risk. But the higher percentage of financial experts on the board is associated with high underwriting risk. The possible reason is that financial experts possess a deep understanding of a firm's financial situation and may encourage the management to take higher risk in anticipation of a higher return for a positive net present value project. The results are consistent with agency theory and wealth transfer hypothesis in that high risk taking is consistent with shareholder interest maximization. In addition, we find a non-monotonic relation between insider ownership and leverage risk. Finally, we do not find evidence that the Sarbanes-Oxley act have impact on the risk taking behavior.

This paper aims to investigate the effects of corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership, executive remuneration and lock-on control mechanisms on the management of post-IPO cash flows and the firm value. I conduct a panel data analysis by following each of the 68 non-financial firms listed on ISE over a time span of 8 years. In total, I collect 544 firm-year observations over the entire 1994-2005 period. I find a non-linear relationship between the retained proportion of the insiders' share holdings after IPO and the dependent variables (OPROA, ROA and Tobin's Q). There is no significant relation between executive remuneration and post-IPO operating and market performance. This may be due to the low pay for performance sensitivity of the executive remuneration data used in this study. I find a significant relation between ownership concentration as measured by Herfindahl indexes and the performance measures. I also distinguish mainly four types of contractual privileges (contractual devices or lock-on-control mechanisms) given to the controlling shareholders from the IPO prospectuses; "right to receive a pre-determined amount of dividend, right to buy new shares from the existing shareholders, appointment of the pre-determined number of board members and right to cast more than 1 vote for one share". I also find that these privileges have important implications for post- IPO performance in Turkey. (c) International Economic Society.

This paper examines the link between equity compensation and executive risk taking in the merger process. We develop our hypotheses based on agency, prospect, and behavior agency theories. Based on a sample of 668 mergers during the period of 1993 to 2005, we find that acquiring firms'CEOs and executives have significantly higher equity compensation as a ratio of total compensation and their value of equity compensation enjoys a higher sensitivity to share price and return volatility compared to target firms prior to the initiation of the merger. When management is compensated with more stocks or options and the pay-for-performance sensitivity of their compensation is higher, they are more likely to acquire risky and high growth targets. This implies that stock and option grants induce risk-taking decisions for management, suggesting that equity compensation provides management with incentives to align with a firm's desired risk taking behavior.

We examine the determinants and implications of Chinese corporate cash holdings in the 1993- 2006 period. Agency theories assert that firms with a large controlling shareholder have relatively large cash holdings because of the greater ability of the controlling shareholder to extract private benefits from the cash holdings. Our findings show a very strong inverse relationship between cash holdings and firm valuation in high government ownership firms. Also, we find that in firms with high government ownership, dividend payouts are highly valued. We conclude that Chinese investors see government ownership as a factor that reduces firm value. They prefer relatively higher dividends from firms having high government ownership. Conversely, investors assign much higher value to firms with relatively low government ownership and they tend to be neutral about the dividends payouts of such firms. Also, investors value highly the presence of foreign investors in Chinese firms and tend to be neutral about dividend payouts of firms with high foreign ownership concentration.

Bondholder governance through the use of bond covenants and the interactions between shareholder and bondholder governance mechanisms has been recently highlighted in the corporate governance literature. In this paper, we study bondholder governance mechanisms through takeover-related bond covenants (i.e., poison puts), confirm with agency theory on the characteristics of firms that are more likely to use these covenants, and emphasize the importance of bondholder governance in the overall structure of corporate governance. We find that poison puts are often bundled with asset sale, payout, and financing restrictions, which is consistent with agency theory. We also find that high growth firms, large, profitable, low-leverage firms are more likely to use poison puts. In addition, our results on free cash flow, insider and institutional ownership provide support for agency explanation. Lastly, we find that poor bond market performance and good equity market performance are likely to motivate the incidence of poison put bond issuance. Volatility of interest rate and volatility of bond index returns motivate more issues of poison put debt. Finally, greater market term and default premiums promote the use of poison puts.

This study investigates variables that explain why bidding firms raise their offer price following a negative capital market reaction to a takeover announcement. We find that whilst an increasing number of blockholders restrains the pursuit of unprofitable takeovers, greater institutional ownership and takeover hostility increases the likelihood a bidder will raise their offer price. Multiple bidders and board independence are unrelated to an increase in takeover price. Inconsistent with agency theory, management ownership and free cash flow do not explain bidder actions.

As a consequence of the paradigm shift from an industrial society to an information society, the role of the entrepreneur ought to change from being an inventor of product/services to become a value creator. Hence, the focus of entrepreneurial ventures should be shifting towards creating viable business models rather than superior product/services. One major implication of the shift of entrepreneurial endeavour from product/services towards creating new business models is that hands on investors behind companies' have to be involved closer to the inception of new ventures in order to contribute to their portfolio companies.

This article takes a broader perspective that encompasses both traditional agency-based explanations of buy-outs as well as recognizing the buy-out phenomenon as a vehicle for entrepreneurial innovation. Although early studies suggested that buy-outs involved both agency cost reduction and entrepreneurial aspects, they did not formally conceptualize these two approaches. The agency theory approach conceptualizes buy-outs as a tool that facilitates cost efficiencies. The entrepreneurial perspective sees buy-outs as a means for implementing new innovations and strategic change that enable fuller exploitation of firm resources that may have been blocked by prior ownership arrangements, such as being part of a large diversified firm or a privately-owned firm with leadership succession problems. The article first elaborates the definitions and sources of buy-outs. Secondly, it reviews theoretical perspectives relating to buy-outs, notably the agency approach and an entrepreneurial perspective which draws on the theory of entrepreneurial cognition. The third main section reviews a model to explain different types of buy-out drawing on these two perspectives. The fourth section reviews studies of the effects of buy-outs, identifying evidence consistent with agency and entrepreneurial views of buy-outs. The final section provides discussion and conclusions. (c) Oxford University Press, 2006. All rights reserved.

The dual-board corporate governance mechanism adopted by publicly listed companies in China combines the board of directors found in the American system and the supervisory board in the German system. Using agency theory, this study investigates the effects of the characteristics of the supervisory board, and in particular its monitoring functions, on the financial risk-taking decisions made by corporate boards. We find that the frequency with which a supervisory board meets can be divided into monitoring-driven and non-monitoring-driven components, and that its monitoring effects on financial risk-taking behaviors are non-linear.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of stock options attribution. We hypothesize that the equity held by managers, the ownership concentration, the liquidity constraints, the firm risk and the firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options. Using a sample of 44 companies listed in Euronext Lisbon, we find that only equity held by managers and firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options, documenting a positive relationship for both.

Agency theory predicts that managerial ownership reduces agency cost and increases firm value. However, empirical evidence on the ownership and firm value relation is, at best, mixed. To date, there is no evidence on how exactly managerial ownership affects firm value and through what channel ownership improves value. Our paper fills in the void in the literature by addressing these issues. As a firm's operating efficiency is an important indicator of its managerial performance, we uses changes in managerial ownership as an argument to evaluate changes in firm value and hypothesizes that changes in managerial ownership affect firm's operating efficiency, which in turn drives firm value. Using a large panel data set (4,451 observations for 1,162 firms for year 1990-2001), we find significantly positive relation between changes in managerial ownership, operating efficiency and changes in firm value. Larger increase in managerial ownership provides greater alignment of managerial interests with those of shareholders, hence greater improvement in firm value. However, this relation is not monotonic. The positive impact on firm's value increases at a decreasing rate. Our simultaneous equation tests remove the endogeneity concern between managerial ownership and firm value.

In this study, we view the contracts of top managers from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are negatively related to a CEO's perceptions of TMT benevolence toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features of TMT contracts. Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) of TMT benevolence and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

Much of the literature on corporate acquisitions has focused on managerial incentives for making acquisitions but has underemphasized the role played by the social context of major shareholders. This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by diversifying the business-that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines performance effects of ownership concentration and two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the United Kingdom and France. We expand and contextualize nascent understanding of multiple agency theory by examining heterogeneity of private equity investors and by suggesting that multiple agency relationships are affected by different institutional contexts. We employ a unique, hand-collected dataset of 224 matched IPOs (112 in each country). Controlling for the endogeneity of private equity investors' retained share ownership, we find support for the agency theory argument that concentrated ownership improves IPOs' performance. The research also shows that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, and the legal institutions in a given country moderate this impact.

We draw from legal theory to offer a fundamental rethinking of agency theory along three key dimensions: redefining the principal from shareholders to the corporation, redefining the status of the board from shareholders' agents to autonomous fiduciaries, and redefining the role of the board from monitors to mediating hierarcha. These dimensions contrast with classic agency theory, offering novel conceptions that can inform further theorization and empirical research in corporate governance. (c)Academy of Management Review.

This paper examines the impact of multiple directorships on stockholder wealth around the announcements of mergers and acquisitions. Grounded in agency theory, we argue that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and thus influence agency conflicts in acquisition decisions. We show that acquiring firms where directors hold more outside board seats experience more negative abnormal returns. This adverse effect, nonetheless, does not extend across the entire range of multiple directorships. Rather, the detrimental impact is significant only when the number of outside board seats surpasses a certain threshold. We interpret this result as suggesting that directors serving on multiple boards allow value-destroying acquisitions when they become too busy beyond a certain point, and the effect of directors' busyness on acquisition performance appears to be nonlinear. We employ several alternative definitions of directors' busyness and obtain consistent results. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the relationship between corporate governance quality and dividend policy in Canada. Based on the agency theory predictions, we consider the effect of two conflicting hypotheses about the effect of corporate governance on dividend payouts: the outcome and substitution hypotheses. The effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms is assessed through the Globe & Mail annual corporate governance index and four sub-categories scores (board composition, shareholding and compensation issues, shareholder rights issues and corporate governance disclosure policy). Using a sample of 714 firm-years listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the period 2002-2005, our results show that firms with stronger corporate governance have higher dividend payouts. Among the four components of the corporate governance index, we document that board composition and shareholder rights' policy are positively related to payout ratios. We also find a positive association between firm size, the level of free cash flows and dividend payouts. Finally, we document a negative relationship between firm risk, US cross-listing and dividend payouts. Taken together our results are consistent with the outcome model of dividend policy.

We argue that executives can affect firm outcomes only if they have influence over crucial decisions. This study explores the impact of CEO power or CEO dominance on bond ratings and yield spreads. We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why bondholders are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. Bondholders demand higher yields because it is difficult for them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs. Taken together, the results suggest that bondholders perceive CEO power as a critical determinant of the cost of bond financing. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

There is a commonly held conviction among governance scholars and practitioners that increasing the number of non-executive directors may have beneficial effects on board practices. This view has gained momentum after each wave of scandals. Given the relevance of the issue in governance studies and practices, the aim of this paper is to investigate how independent, competent and incentivized non-executive directors should be according to governance scholars and board best practices. To answer this question, we conducted a review of the literature on non-executive directors. We then collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and made a comparative analysis of their recommendations about the independence, the competencies and the incentives of non-executive directors. Our results show that (i) non-executive directors' independence is a commonly recommended governance practice, the meaning of which differs widely among countries; (ii) non-executive directors' competencies and incentives are not considered a governance issue to be regulated in detail; (iii) agency theory and the search for appropriate board demography tend to dominate the recommendations of governance literature and codes. Our findings have implications for both research and practice. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to better understand the antecedents of shareholder activism targeted at firms located in three common law countries (i.e., USA, UK, and Australia) and three civil law countries (Japan, Germany, and South Korea) during the 2003-07 time period. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings suggest that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary by the motivation of the activist. We demonstrate that activists target firms with two motives (a) to improve the financial performance, and (b) to improve the social performance of the firm. With respect to the target firm level antecedents, we find that firm size is unrelated to financial activism, but positively related to social activism; ownership concentration is negatively related to both financial and social activism; and prior profitability is negatively related to financial activism, but positively related to social activism. Further, these relationships in the case of financial activism are generally stronger in common law legal systems, whereas those in the case of social activism are generally stronger in environments with a greater level of income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings suggest that future research should differentiate between the motivations of the activism event. Further, we find that while agency logic works well for financial activism, institutional theory provides stronger explanations for social activism. Overall, we demonstrate the complementary nature of these two theories in explaining shareholder activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We found that the "exposure" to shareholder activism varies by the motivation of the activist, and the nature of the firm and its national context. An understanding of these issues would help firms develop proper response strategies to activism events. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study examined the influence of working capital management components on corporate profitability. A sample of 30 firms listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) for the periods 1993 to 2008 was used. Both the pooled OLS and the fixed effects regression models were used. The key findings from the study were: (1) there exists a highly significant negative relationship between the time it takes for firms to collect cash from their customers (accounts collection period) and profitability (p <0.01). This means that more profitable firms take the shortest time to collect cash from their customers; (2) there exists a highly significant positive relationship between the period taken to convert inventories into sales (the inventory conversion period) and profitability (p <0.01). This means that firms which maintain sufficiently high inventory levels reduce costs of possible interruptions in the production process and loss of business due to scarcity of products. This reduces the firm supply costs and protects them against price fluctuations; (3) there exists a highly significant positive relationship between the time it takes the firm to pay its creditors (average payment period) and profitability (p <0.01). This implies that the longer a firm takes to pay its creditors, the more profitable it is. (c) 2010 Academic Journals Inc.

Using a sample of 56 Italian IPOs issued between 1999 and 2005, several hypotheses are tested on the interplay between corporate governance, family ownership and performance. Specifically tested is which approach among all agency, stewardship, and contingency theory is most appropriate for Italian family firms. Findings suggest that board independence increases with family disinvestment at IPO, presence of venture capitalists, establishment of large and active boards, and existence of appointment and compensation committees. At the same time, results indicate that the presence of independent directors affects performance positively but with little statistical significance, while family involvement and the presence of execution committees negatively impact share performance.

To many, the principal-agent model is the obvious lens through which executive pay should be viewed. Such a sentiment sits uncomfortably with a large number of empirical studies suggesting that the process of determining executive pay seems to be more readily explained by recourse to arguments of managerial power and influence. This article investigates the micro-underpinnings of boardroom behavior in order to explain this departure from principal-agency theory's argument that executive compensation serves to align interests between the owners of the company and its senior managers. We find that there are strong interaction effects among social influence variables and the social setting of boardroom activity. Generous pay awards, bearing only a weak connection to corporate performance, are explained in the context of the social psychology of the boardroom. These results and a review of the empirical research, suggest the need for a more comprehensive model of executive compensation that incorporates both economic and psychological determinants.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on corporate reputation. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a panel of firms in Spain for 2000-2007, we found that ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholder erodes corporate reputation, whereas contestability of the main shareholder's power enhances it. Insider ownership shows a non-linear relationship with corporate reputation, with lower corporate reputation at low and very high levels of insider ownership. Finally, if the largest shareholder is either a pressure-resistant or a pressure-sensitive institutional investor, as opposed to other types of largest shareholder, corporate reputation is lower. This last finding markedly differentiates our sample of firms in Spain, a civil law country, from firms in common law countries such as the US and the UK, where studies have found a positive relationship between institutional investors and corporate reputation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on signaling and agency theories, our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to analyze the influence of ownership structure on corporate reputation in civil law countries. Practitioners/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers and directors should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure influences the expectations of stakeholders. Low levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders, low differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders, and moderate levels of insider ownership are positive signals that should be communicated to foster corporate reputation. High levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders or high differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders impair corporate reputation and should be compensated by introducing corporate governance mechanisms that favor corporate reputation, such as increasing the number of independent directors or avoiding CEO duality.

This study uses a sample of 213 Brazilian firms listed between 1995 and 2004 to examine the effect of the presence or absence of growth opportunities on the subsequent effect of leverage, dividend payout, and ownership concentration on firm value. First, we find that leverage plays a dual role: whereas it negatively affects the value of firms with growth opportunities (i.e., underinvestment theory), it positively affects the value of firms without growth opportunities (i.e., overinvestment theory). Second, we find that dividends play a disciplinary role in firms with fewer growth opportunities by reducing free cash flow under managerial control. Finally, the results show that ownership structure has a nonlinear effect-that is, ownership concentration initially improves the value of most firms. However, after a certain threshold, in firms with growth opportunities, the risk increases that large shareholders expropriate wealth at the expense of minority shareholders. Copyright (c) 2010 M.E.

We analyze bank governance, share ownership, CEO compensation, and bank risk taking in the period leading to the current banking crisis. Using a sample of large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we find that BHCs with greater managerial control, achieved through various corporate governance mechanisms, take less risk. BHCs that pay CEOs high base salaries also take less risk, while BHCs that grant CEOs more in stock options or that pay CEOs higher bonuses take more risk. The evidence is generally consistent with BHC managers exhibiting greater risk aversion than outside shareholders, but with several factors affecting managers' risk-taking incentives.

Manuscript Type: ConceptualResearch Question/Issue: The aim of this research study is to theorize about the antecedents of the "board independence norm" (BIN), defined as the standard of having independent directors on corporate boards. The research approach is a comparative analysis of two governance settings - Sweden and the UK. Research Findings/Insights: The UK governance system uses a BIN of power balance from a shareholder perspective, while the Swedish governance system uses a BIN of social connectedness from a stakeholder perspective. However, our findings also suggest that exogenous variables such as pressures to conform to global "best practice" are antecedents of the BIN in the governance codes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Any global theory of board independence must integrate differences in board structure and ownership patterns, as well as social connectedness in corporate networks. Furthermore, in addition to economic welfare, social welfare and stakeholder balance should also be considered. A synthesis of the "Varieties of Capitalism" and "New Institutional" perspectives considers that corporate governance is embedded in economic, cultural, and social contexts, yet also addresses institutional forces of conformity that are exogenous to the governance system. This seems to be a more promising framework for comparative governance research than "Contingent Agency Theory."Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multi-national regulative frameworks should focus on general principles of board independence. Local standard setters might then focus on developing a BIN that fits the specific institutional setting. We provide suggestions about how standard setters in Sweden and the UK can make their BINs more consistent with their settings. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the governance structure of monasteries to gain new insights and apply them to solve agency problems of modern corporations. In an historic analysis of crises and closures it asks, if Benedictine monasteries were and are capable of solving agency problems. The analysis shows that monasteries established basic governance instruments very early and therefore were able to survive for centuries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a dataset of all Benedictine abbeys that ever existed in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg, and German-speaking Switzerland to determine their lifespan and the reasons for closures. The governance mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Finally, it draws conclusions relevant to the modern corporation. The theoretical foundations are based upon principal agency theory, psychological economics, as well as embeddedness theory. Findings: The monasteries that are examined show an average lifetime of almost 500 years and only a quarter of them dissolved as a result of agency problems. This paper argues that this success is due to an appropriate governance structure that relies strongly on internal control mechanisms. Research limitations/implications: Benedictine monasteries and stock corporations differ fundamentally regarding their goals. Additional limitations of the monastic approach are the tendency to promote groupthink, the danger of dictatorship and the life long commitment. Practical implications: The paper adds new insights into the corporate governance debate designed to solve current agency problems and facilitate better control. Originality/value: By analyzing monasteries, a new approach is offered to understand the efficiency of internal behavioral incentives and their combination with external control mechanisms in corporate governance.

This paper investigates the effects of certain corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Based on a sample of 93 firms for the period 1996 through 1999, our results show an optimal board size of ten, favour concentrated over diffused ownership, and support separation of posts of CEO and chair. Moreover, while director shareholding is found to be an insignificant factor affecting firm performance, the results show expatriate CEOs performing better than their local counterparts. We need to err on the side of caution as sampling selection was based on data availability rather than any probability criterion. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Using data from 708 small and medium Italian firms during the period of 2002-2004, we find that in family firms (FFs) a nonfamily Chief Financial Officer (CFO) drives firm performance in a positive direction. FFs with a nonfamily CFO perform better than both FFs with a family CFO and nonfamily firms. The best performance is achieved when the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is a family member and the CFO is an outsider (nonfamily).An examination of FFs across generations shows that a nonfamily CFO has always a positive effect on firm performance. Our study contributes to the literature on FFs by determining how the presence of a nonfamily CFO has an impact on firm performance. We also contribute to the literature on agency theory by showing that in small FFs: (a) having a family as majority shareholder is not detrimental to firm performance and (b) a nonfamily CFO might serve to mitigate any ineptness of descendant CEOs while retaining ownership and management in the hands of family heirs, thus avoiding the conflict of interest between family ownership and management.

Due to the significant role of non-profit organizations in the development of modern societies, these organizations must adjust their boardrooms. Since traditional theories of corporate governance appear to be limited in explaining the changing non-profit world, we propose an extended model of governance that integrates the traditional arguments of agency theory with a cognitive dimension. Based on a sample of Spanish foundations, we present evidence on the effect of the board composition on foundations' organizational efficiency. We show that board size and independence do not have a definitive effect on the entity's efficiency. Instead, the knowledge diversity inside the boardroom and the active character of trustees have a positive influence on resource allocation. The cognitive dimension of the extended model of governance is critical to explaining how boards impact on organizational performance. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

The question of the influence of ownership structure on corporate diversification strategy incites debate. Past research has led to controversial results whether it is based on agency theory, strategic approach or stewardship theory. We propose new empirical evidence by applying this question to the context of family businesses in France. We find that family businesses are more diversified than non-family businesses, which contradicts past results of studies based on US samples. This finding underlines the importance of considering the diversity of international contexts. Our analysis also shows that there is a negative relationship between the presence of a shareholder block and the level of diversification only for non-family businesses. This result emphasizes the particularity of family businesses in terms of the links between governance structure and business strategy. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is no difference between family and non-family businesses in terms of the choice of diversification type (related or unrelated). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Agency theory suggests that governance matters more among firms with greater potential agency costs. Rational investors are unlikely to value safeguards against unlikely events. Yet, few studies of the relation between governance and firm value control for investor perceptions of the likelihood of agency conflicts. Shleifer and Vishny [Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., 1997. A survey of corporate governance. Journal of Finance 52, 737-783] identify investment-related agency conflicts as the more severe type of agency conflicts in the US. We measure the perceived likelihood of this type of agency conflict using free cash flow (Jensen, M.C., 1986. Agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance, and takeovers. American Economic Review 76, 323-329). We find that firm value is an increasing function of improved governance quality among firms with high free cash flow. In contrast, governance benefits are lower or insignificant among firms with low free cash flow. We show that not controlling for this conditional relation between governance and firm value could lead to erroneous conclusions that governance and firm value are unrelated. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines if the CEO duality influences firm performance in Bangladesh. It also examines the interaction of industries in influencing the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. From an observation of 825 firm years the study uses a 2-stage least square regression (2SLS) analysis. The finding is that there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. However, when the industry interaction terms (the role of industries as moderating variable) are added, the CEO duality and firm performance is found to vary across industries. The findings of this study suggest that the CEO duality and firm performance is contingent; no single leadership structure is universal; both the leadership structure has cost and benefits. It is beneficial in some situation supporting the stewardship theory while it is not in other situations supporting the agency theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality and firm performance in the context of developing countries.

We employ three views of agency theory in unison to investigate managerial risk-taking in uncertain markets. Using 124 firms that filed to go public toward the end of the technology boom (2000-2002), we explore the influence of CEO ownership on the decision to continue or withdraw an initial public offering (IPO) in deteriorating public equity markets. We find an inverse U-shaped relationship between CEOs' equity participation and the decision to proceed with a public offering: the probability of IPO cancellation in weak capital markets increases as CEOs hold too little or too much ownership. Our results also indicate that a firm's debt levels are positively linked with the IPO decision. CEO ownership and leverage intensity interact to influence the decision to take a firm public.

We conduct an experiment to examine how lending decisions are affected by lender perceptions of reporting and governance quality. We perform a set of experiments to determine whether lenders are sensitive to the quality of governance as measured by board composition along multiple dimensions, whether their perceptions of reporting reliability are a function of the strength of the board, and whether their lending decisions are then affected by their perceptions of reporting reliability. Study participants are a group of 62 professional lenders from Singapore, with at least three years of professional credit analysis and lending experience. We find that lenders are primarily sensitive to financial condition and the perceived reliability of financial reporting. While we also find that lenders are sensitive to board strength, further tests suggest lenders appear particularly sensitive to board strength only for relatively highperforming firms. We also find that the perceived reliability of the financial reports does not appear to be affected by board strength or by the applicant's financial condition. The paper discusses implications for policy making, practice, and research.

While much has been written on specificity (e.g., in texts on new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory), there are still some insights to be learnt by business ethicists. This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the "theory of the firm" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership. The article will close with some discussion of the implications and future prospects for business ethics. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The study seeks to understand whether the proximity of the largest shareholder (controller) to the locus of management - whether the controller is a top executive, a board member, or an outsider - determines the value of US dual-class firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 209 US dual class firms from the year 2000 and a corresponding control sample of single-class firms, we run cross-sectional regressions to determine the effect of the controller on firm value. We present robust evidence that dual-class firm value is negatively related to controller proximity. Dual-class structure overall is unrelated to firm value, because despite its negative effects with high proximity controllers there appear to be benefits when controller proximity is low (when the largest shareholder is an outsider). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Ownership structure is a widely studied subject but most studies focus on insider ownership. More nuanced aspects of ownership such as controller proximity are needed in empirical studies and theoretical models. These nuances could help us better understand the interplay between the incentive of various parties (e.g., managers, large shareholders) and the opportunity available for extraction of private benefits. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A practitioner implication is that shareholder of high-proximity dual-class firms must seek additional control mechanisms to curb agency costs. A policy implication is that investor protection (laws and institutional structure protecting shareholders) works only to a limited extent - it curbs overt acts of expropriation, but cannot eliminate acts engineered by insiders.

Tournament theory provides the basis for an assessment of the impact of pay disparity on performance. New evidence is provided regarding tournament theory by assessing two questions: (1) whether pay disparity leads to incentives for managers to engage in strategies that benefit the shareholders of the firm and (2) whether governance quality moderates the pay disparity-performance relationship, consistent with agency theory. Four measures of corporate governance are examined in order to assess governance's moderating role on the relationship between pay disparity and firm performance. The results suggest that while pay disparity can provide incentives for better performance, consistent with tournament theory, it can become destructive if it is reflective of agency conflict.

Consistent with agency theory, we find that bidder managers make takeover financing decisions in ways that circumvent more effective monitors. Bidder managers are more likely to use cash rather than stock when targets have aggressive outside blockholders. We also find that the likelihood of a cash offer decreases when aggressive outside bidder block ownership is relatively low. However, the likelihood of a cash offer increases when aggressive outside bidder blockholding is in the intermediate range, a range of ownership where their continued influence over managerial decisions is threatened by a stock offer. Furthermore, we find that bidder management tends to use cash when its outside bidder blockholders are less aggressive. Overall, our findings indicate that managerial decisions on financing takeovers are motivated to prevent aggressive outside blockholders from gaining more control.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: We ask two research questions: (1) How do CEO stock ownership and options influence the amount of equity capital that a foreign firm raises in US capital markets? (2) How does the foreign firm's home-country risk moderate these relationships? Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of firms from 40 countries that raised equity capital via ADR offerings between 1994 and 2005. Using a full-information maximum likelihood approach to estimate a model that accounts for sample selection associated with non-capital raising ADRs and non-listed ADRs, as well as hot and cold equity markets, we found that CEO stock and option ownership lead to a higher level of equity capital raised. Interestingly, the level of home-country risk of the issuing firm weakens the relationship between the CEO stock ownership and the amount of equity capital raised, but strengthens the relationship between CEO stock options and ADR equity capital raised. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We develop a framework that draws on behavioral decision making and agency theory to suggest that executive risk taking varies across countries and different forms of monitoring (stock ownership versus options) and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse behaviors. We also examined the potential corporate governance costs associated with principal-principal conflict as it relates to CEO stock-based compensation and the implications for raising equity capital. Because stock ownership and stock options have different risk profiles, and foreign firms operate in countries with different home-country risk, we theorize how home-country risk will moderate the relationship between CEO stock ownership or options with the amount of equity capital raised by a foreign firm in US stock markets through the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that US investors pay attention to the types of stock-based executive compensation used by firms that raise capital in the US. In particular, CEOs of firms from higher risk countries need to consider US investors' perceptions of their stock-based compensation because it may hamper the firm's effectiveness in raising capital in the US.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of corporate governance and internationalization on research and development (R&D) investments in USbased international firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws from agency theory to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanisms and internationalization on R&D intensity by the use of longitudinal data from 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2000 in a sample of large, manufacturing US firms with international operations. Findings - The paper finds that CEO total compensation is positively associated with R&D intensity, whereas equity voting power, insider ownership, and duality are negatively associated. Research limitations/implications - The findings regarding insider ownership confirms agency theory, in that agents will tend to make decisions to maximize their own utility and thus would be expected to reject R&D investments. In terms of duality, the augmented discretion that CEOs assume when they also hold the chairmanship position may reduce the monitoring function of the board, making it easier for the CEO to avoid engaging in shortterm risky ventures. Additionally, CEOs are likely to demand larger salaries when faced with risky decisions because their employment stability and reputation are at stake. Practical implications - Boards concerned with firm innovation should focus their decisions on CEO salaries on total compensation rather than on shortterm performance. Total compensation may motivate CEOs to commit to R&D investments that lead to innovations despite the risk of failure and detrimental impact on shortterm profits. Firms should be cautious in granting ownership to board members. Although ownership often stimulates commitment to strategic decisions, overinvolvement of board insiders may result in risk aversion, leading to decreases in R&D efforts. Originality/value - This paper extends the literature by integrating agency theory and organization learning in a comprehensive framework, showing that governance and internationalization play a significant role in firm R&D intensity.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

From the agency perspective, literature studying links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude - not familiness - does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking.

Modern corporations have been widely accused of promoting values of managerial autonomy that can result in managerial waste and opportunistic behaviour, leading organizational theorists to suggest the adoption of alternative organizational forms that should normatively and structurally limit such autonomy. However, this mixed-methods study of an alternative organizational form - income trusts (1995-2005) - finds that income trusts were also characterized by excessive managerial autonomy. Managers strategically used the income trust form in discretionary ways such as by providing little information on important decisions to external parties, limiting investors' right to oppose managerial actions and retaining firm earnings to a great extent. Thus, the article concludes that alternative organizational forms do not necessarily promote an ethical business culture since they are unable to overcome deeply institutionalized values of managerial autonomy.

Agency theory indicates that management ownership might reduce the conflict of interests between managers and stockholders. Several studies have supported the argument that executive compensation plans can motive executives to enhance firm performance and maintaining profit. This paper examines whether the compensation of executives through stock options influences the firm's restructuring or liquidation decisions. The findings suggest that, the higher equity incentive and the lower the value of executive stock option in executives' compensation plan, the more restucturing decisions the executive will make, even when these choices could accelerate the firm's failure. Nevertheless, there is only weak evidence that replacing the executive will increase the likelihood of restructuring decisions over liquidation decisions when the firm is facing financial distress.

An organization's board is an important governance mechanism to incorporate corporate governance provisions in financial markets. Previous studies on board size and the value of a firm relationship (BVF) are inconclusive and lack a comparative and comprehensive analysis of this relationship which incorporates the role of additional factors present in the developing financial market. This study bridges the gap in the literature by providing some additional empirical evidence about the BVF relationship. This evidence is provided by performing a comparative and comprehensive analysis of the firms in developing and developed financial markets. Based on a sophisticated data set for the selected markets, two separate models are run and their results are compared. The results for this study suggest that in the developing market a bigger board improves the value of a firm, supporting the relevance of stewardship theory. On the contrary, in the developed market a smaller board improves shareholders' value, supporting the agency theory. The study has reflected the differences in the efficiency of institutional framework and the sophistication of financial development in a selection of countries, in the results on the BVF relationship. Furthermore, these results make the applicability of different business theories explaining market operations in these markets different from each other. The results are innovative and valuable to academics, analysts and industry professionals in both developing and developed financial markets.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of ownership structure and board structure on performance in VC-backed firms. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of ownership structure and board structure on performance and also to analyze whether ownership structure (ownership concentration, director ownership, venture capital ownership and employee ownership) and board variables (size, outside directors, COE-chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROE. And strong negative relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROA. No strong relation was found between venture-capital ownership, employee ownership and firm performance. Results show also a strong negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE and positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE and negatively associated with ROA. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with ROA. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance.

This paper tests the effect of managerial (inside) and block-holders (outside) ownership in relation to agency theory in Malaysian business environment. This study tests the agency relationship in different culture and social contact and provides evidence whether agency theory in non-western organizations have equal impact in Asian organizations. Consistent with agency theory and the convergence of interest hypothesis, managerial ownership (insiders) in Malaysia indicate a negative relationship with the demand for monitoring. This finding may be due to the fact that as the managers are also the owners, there is less conflict, less information asymmetry and less hierarchical organization structure in the companies, which lead to lower monitoring costs. However, another ownership structure, outside block-holders appear to demand more monitoring. This positive relationship may be explained by their effort to compensate their lack of involvement in the daily transactions and internal decisions of the company, especially in the concentrated business environment in the country.

There is controversy in the literature about the effects of ownership on strategy and performance. Some scholars have taken agency explanations as definitive, arguing that closely held firms outperform. Empirical studies, however, show conflicting findings for firms with concentrated ownership: lone founder firms outperform, family firms do not. Such conflicts may be due to the failure of agency theory to distinguish between the social contexts of these different types of owners. We argue that explanations of performance must take into account not simply ownership, but who are the owners or executives and how their social contexts may influence their strategic priorities. Family owners and CEOs, influenced by family stakeholders in the business, are argued to assume the role identities and logics of family nurturers and thus strategies of conservation. By contrast, lone founders, influenced by a wider set of market-oriented stakeholders, are argued to embrace the identities and logics of entrepreneurs and strategies of growth. Family founders and founder-executives are held to blend both orientations. These notions are supported in a study of Fortune 1000 companies. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Does corporate governance explain US bank performance during the period leading up to the financial crisis? We adopt the factor structure by Larcker, Richardson, and Tuna (2007) to measure multiple dimensions of corporate governance for 236 public commercial banks. Research Findings/Insights: Findings reveal corporate governance factors explain financial performance better than loan quality. We find strong support for a negative association between leverage and both financial performance and loan quality. CEO duality is negatively associated with financial performance. The extent of executive incentive pay is positively associated with financial performance but exhibits a negative association with loan quality in the long-run. We find a concave relationship between financial performance and both board size and average director age. We provide weak evidence of an association of anti-takeover devices, board meeting frequency, and affiliated nature of committees with financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the banking industry and expect that the governance-performance linkage might differ due to the unique regulatory and business environment. Results extend Larcker et al. (2007), especially regarding the concave relationship between board size and performance, and the role of leverage. Given the lack of support for our agency theory predictions, we suggest that alternative theories are needed to understand the performance implications of corporate governance at banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer contributions to regulators, especially for ongoing financial reforms of capital requirements and executive compensation. Specifically, we show a consistent negative association between leverage and performance, which supports the current debate on Tier I capital limits for banks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Motivated by agency theory, we investigate how a firm's overall quality of corporate governance affects its dividend policy. Using a large sample of firms with governance data from The Institutional Shareholder Services, we find that firms with stronger governance exhibit a higher propensity to pay dividends, and, similarly, dividend payers tend to pay larger dividends. The results are consistent with the notion that shareholders of firms with better governance quality are able to force managers to disgorge more cash through dividends, thereby reducing what is left for expropriation by opportunistic managers. We employ the two-stage least squares approach to cope with possible endogeneity and still obtain consistent results. Our results are important as they show that corporate governance quality does have a palpable impact on critical corporate decisions such as dividend policy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the risk-related disclosure (RRD) practices in annual reports for 2005 Portuguese companies in the non-finance sector. Design/methodology/approach: The paper conducts a content analysis of a sample of 81 companies (42 listed and 39 unlisted). In considering corporate governance effects, the sample is reduced to the 42 listed companies that are required to disclose a corporate governance report. Findings: Implementation of IAS/IFRS and the European Union's Modernisation Directive in 2005 did not affect the quantity and quality of RRD positively. Disclosures are generic, qualitative and backward-looking. Public visibility (as assessed by size and environmental sensitivity) is a crucial influence in explaining RRD: companies appear to manage their reputation through disclosure of risk-related information. Agency costs associated with leverage are important influences also. In listed companies, the presence of independent directors improves the level of RRD. Research limitations/implications: Content analysis does not allow readily for in-depth qualitative inquiry. The coding instrument is subject to coder bias. Information about risk can be provided in sources other than annual reports. The study is confined to one year/one country and pre-dates the global financial crisis (GFC) (2008) and the implementation of IFRS 7 (2007). Originality/value: The results point to the desirability of enhancing accountability by mandating further disclosure of substantive and relevant risk-related information in company annual reports. The RRD observed are shown to be explained by a confluence of agency theory, legitimacy theory and resources-based perspectives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

As corporate managers interact with nonshareholder stakeholders, potential tradeoffs emerge and questions arise as to how these interactions impact shareholder value. We argue that this shareholder-stakeholder debate is an important issue within the overall corporate governance and corporate policy domain and examine one such stakeholder group - employees - by studying labor-friendly corporate practices. We find that announcements of labor-friendly policies are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. Labor-friendly firms also outperform otherwise similar firms, both in terms of long-run stock market returns and operating results. In addition, we find that the probability and benefits of labor-friendliness increase with the demand for highly skilled labor. Our analysis of excess executive compensation suggests that top management derives no pecuniary benefits from labor-friendly practices. We interpret our results as consistent with a genuine concern for employees translating into higher productivity and profitability, which in turn facilitate value creation. It appears that the benefits of labor-friendly practices significantly outweigh the costs and that what is good for employees is good for shareholders. (c) Springer 2010.

This paper contributes to multiple agency theory by examining how the compensation schemes awarded to outside directors and the CEO jointly affect firm-level risk taking. Using data of the S&P 1500 firms from 1997 to 2006, we find support for earlier arguments that providing the CEO, the outside directors, or both with stock options increases risk taking. More importantly, we find that compensating outside directors with stock options has significantly stronger effects than CEO stock options. Finally, contrary to what one would expect, we find that these effects are mutually substituting; that is, if both the outside directors and the CEO are provided with stock option compensation, outside directors' incentives weaken the effect of the CEO's incentives on firms' risk taking.

We employ agency theory to argue that the effects of family (and founder) ownership versus management will be quite different: the former is expected to contribute positively to performance, the latter is argued to erode performance. Previous studies, due to problems of multicollinearity have been unable to distinguish these effects. Using a Bayesian approach that avoids these problems, we find that whereas family and founder ownership are associated with superior performance, the results for family and even founder management are more ambiguous. Our study is the first to assess the distinctive performance effects of family and founder presence in both ownership and management using a Bayesian approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbanks serve micro-enterprises and poor people with financial services. This study examines how various aspects of international influence affect microbanks' financial and social performance. Grounded in agency theory and resource-based theory, we argue that there are multiple ways that the internationalization of microbanks might affect performance. Specifically, we argue that one can distinguish between four sources of such internationalization effects; international initiator, international directorship, international debt, and international affiliation/networks. This study utilizes data from 379 microbanks in 73 developing countries - assessed between 2001 and 2008. We find that the internationalization of microbanks to a large extend enhances social performance, but does not enhance financial performance. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper focuses on the relationship between one of the main corporate governance dimensions - ownership structure - and income smoothing. The paper investigates whether family-controlled companies differ from non-family-controlled companies with respect to income smoothing. Due to different incentives of management and owner investment horizons, we hypothesize that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than among non-family-controlled companies. Additionally, we hypothesize that among family-controlled firms income smoothing is less likely when CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Various definitions of "family control" are applied. A sample of Italian listed companies is used for the empirical analysis. Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than non-family-controlled companies. Moreover, among family-controlled companies, income smoothing is less likely for firms whose CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper fills a gap in the literature, suggesting that not only the level of ownership concentration or insider ownership but also the nature of the dominant shareholder (family versus non-family) should be considered when addressing the motivations for income smoothing. Furthermore, our findings indicate that agency theory and stewardship theory are complementary in explaining the role played by family control in income smoothing decisions. While in non-family-controlled companies the traditional owner-manager agency problems tend to prevail and motivate income smoothing, in family-controlled companies such agency issues become less relevant and a stewardship attitude emerges, rendering income smoothing less likely. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study is of interest to financial statement users, including analysts and investors, as it shows that different company types (e.g., family versus non-family) have a different attitude towards income smoothing. In particular, these results aid users in interpreting the company's reported profitability and its potential variability. The conclusions also are of interest to auditors when evaluating the reliability of the reported income of companies characterized by various ownership structures. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Recent research from the United States has advocated increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control to mitigate principal-agent conflicts for entrepreneurial firms. By contrast, this study aims to demonstrate that the major governance problem in an emerging economy is principal-principal conflicts, and that increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control will instead reinforce such conflicts and IPO underpricing. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 525 IPO firms in Taiwan, an emerging economy, this study finds that increasing family ownership and institutional ownership and introducing CEO duality increase IPO underpricing, while employing independent outside directors mitigates IPO underpricing. These results are consistent with our hypotheses concerning principal-principal conflicts. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results are quite different from those of prior research using US data, in that institutions are weaker in an emerging economy than in the United States, where principal-agent conflicts are the main concern. Consequently, corporate governance research, particularly when conducted outside the US, should consider institutional contexts, which agency theory fails to do. As such, institutional theory offers a promising approach. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Government policies designed to address principal-agent conflicts, such as increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control, may make principal-principal conflicts worse and increase IPO underpricing in an emerging economy. To mitigate principal-principal conflicts and IPO underpricing, regulatory reforms need to reduce ownership concentration, separate ownership, and control, and strengthen formal institutions that help minority shareholders monitor firm decisions.

Little research has examined the performance implications of the parent-child relationship post spin-off. Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough. Our study extends understanding of post spin-off child firm performance and provides valuable insights for both parent and child firms. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of managerial ownership in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. In addition to examining the total managerial shareholdings, this study also investigates the association between direct and indirect managerial shareholdings with agency costs. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the study is obtained from two sources, namely primary (questionnaire) and secondary (annual reports) data. The sample companies are 235 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ended 2006. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Findings: The results of the study indicate that managerial ownership in various segments has an inverse relationship with total monitoring costs as predicted in agency theory. This finding is consistent with earlier studies in western countries and supports the convergence of interest hypothesis. Originality/value: This study gives a unique contribution to corporate governance studies relating to the effect of ownership structure in relation to agency theory in Malaysian companies, one of the countries in Asia. Previous studies claimed that it is unknown whether the agency theory findings in western countries have equal impact in Asian organizations. Previous literature also indicates that there is a possibility that given the cultural differences, the typical nature of agents in agency theory may not be the case with regard to non-western countries. Thus, this study provides evidence that support prior research findings in western countries relating to the effect of managerial ownership on the agency relationship which is reflected in its agency costs.

We study the decision to distribute funds as well as the choice of the payout channel (i.e. dividends, repurchases, or both). Our analysis of the payout policy of UK firms demonstrates that the importance of share repurchases is increasing, but dividends still constitute a vast proportion of the total payout. We document that there is a relation between the presence of blockholders and the choice of the payout channel. We find that payout decisions are influenced by directors' liquidity needs but are not consistent with the agency theory of payout. We also reject the tax-clientele explanation for payout choices.

This purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of board and audit committee meeting frequency. The determinants studied are related to the ownership structure and to the board characteristics. The study is conducted in an agency setting featured by high ownership concentration and large insider shareholders. Hypotheses are developed based on agency theory. The empirical evidence is provided by a sample of Italian listed companies. Negative binomial regression is used in the multivariate analysis to test the relationships. Robustness checks provide further empirical support. The paper finds that insider ownership negatively impacts -- either on the board or on the audit committee meeting frequency -- whilst the proportion of independent directors in the board has a positive impact. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that insider ownership and board independent monitoring are substitute control mechanisms. The findings also show that audit committees are more active in larger firms. The paper provides an agency theory-based explanation of the board and the audit committee meeting frequency, in a setting featured by large controlling shareholders.

Agency theory stipulates that executives will use their superior information to exploit owners unless effectively monitored or incentivized to do otherwise: Agents here are held to be opportunists and owners responsible parties. However, sometimes agency theory misses the mark and the reverse holds true. It may be the owners who exploit their firm and compromise its long-term interests, and steward-like agents who use their superior information to benefit a firm and its stakeholders. This analysis provides an inspiring historical example of how that can happen and illustrates some conditions under which one might expect similarly happy circumstances to arise.

We investigate the impact of board independence on earnings management on a sample of family controlled firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Using panel data over the period 2000-2004, we find evidence of earnings management among family controlled firms in Australia, an environment of high investor protection and private benefits of control. Findings show that a higher proportion of independent directors on boards is effective in reducing earnings management, thereby mitigating agency problems associated with entrenchment and expropriation in family firms. We also find that managers of family firms are less aggressive in managing earnings via discretionary long-term accruals compared to non-family firms. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For decades, managers' powers and their freedom to make strategic decisions were taken for granted in the field of corporate governance. The present crisis has revealed that their managerial latitude is in reality much weaker than thought. The growing influence of shareholders has undermined the historical and professional legitimacy of managers, who are now viewed as 'agents' controlled by 'principals'. This paper makes two contributions. First, we hold that the crisis is not a purely economic or financial crisis but a fundamental crisis of management, with its function of regulating the relationship between the firm and society. Second, we show that this crisis is rooted in law, since corporate law does not actually protect the autonomy of management. Until now, management theory has underestimated the role of law in the evolutions of corporate governance; we argue that management research needs to open its boundaries and specifically to re-examine corporate law. We suggest new governance rules to ensure managers have the latitude to organize collective creation processes in a way that is both efficient and legitimate. And we discuss some avenues for reflecting on a post-crisis business law. (c) 2011 The Author(s). British Journal of Management (c) 2011 British Academy of Management.

In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. (c) 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Our analysis of more than 1,000 Chinese listed firms, 2003-2005, reveals a positive association between state ownership (SO) and firm performance. Arguably, if SO "causes" performance, it must be through the channel of agency cost. Therefore, our paper checks the robustness of this positive SO/performance finding by analyzing the role of agency cost as a mediator. It emerges that SO in the Chinese context may represent a strategic asset rather than an agency burden. However, it is not clear whether this is an outcome driven by efficiency or power.

This paper investigates the influence of firm-level corporate governance on the capital structure pattern of non-financial listed firms, using a case study of Bangladesh. The agency theory suggests that better corporate governance will reduce agency costs and improve investor confidence, which in turn will enhance the ability of a firm to gain access to equity finance, reducing dependence on debt finance. Conversely, the controlling shareholders of poorly governed firms are likely to prefer debt, in order to retain absolute ownership and control rights. The OLS regression framework uses a questionnaire-survey based Corporate Governance Index (CGI). The study results seem to support agency theory, with a statistically significant inverse relationship between corporate governance quality and the total as well as long-term debt ratios.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Prior evidence suggests that investor protection enhances corporate valuation. Focusing on a key investor protection measure, namely, self-dealing regulations, this study examines whether and to what extent the private and public control components of that measure affect firm value. Private control of self-dealing regulations emphasize disclosure and shareholder approval mechanisms, while public control of self-dealing regulations imply enforcement through prison terms, fines, etc. Our analysis takes into account potential agency problems resulting from an ownership wedge, i.e., situations in which cash flow rights are not consistent with control rights. Such situations are quite common in many countries outside of the United States. Research Findings/Results: Based on 4,634 firms from 22 countries, our empirical evidence indicates that private control of self-dealing regulations enhances firm value, while public control regulations lower firm value. In addition, a high ownership wedge, which proxies for agency problems between controlling shareholders and minority investors, dampens the positive association between private control of self-dealing regulations and corporate valuation. However, ownership wedge has no impact on the negative association between public control of self-dealing regulations and corporate valuation. Theoretical Implications: This study represents a refinement and extension of prior work on the value implication from investor protection regulations. It seeks to better define the implications of investor protection regulations by focusing on some of its key components, thus leading to a better understanding of the relations between investor protection regulations, ownership, and firm value. Moreover, the study contributes to the current debate about the importance of country-level institutions (versus firm-level governance as proxied by ownership wedge) in determining firm outcomes such as value. Practitioner Implications: The paper's empirical findings may help policy markers better understand how investors react to regulations about private and public control of self-dealing, thus enhancing their capability to enact more effective regulations.

This paper examines the impact on underpricing and firm market value arising from IPO firms implementing a range of governance attributes such as the separation of CEO and Chairman roles, the founder ceding CEO position, establishment of committees and board size. Furthermore I study the determinants of director retained ownership and the relation between this and underpricing. Using a comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm's from across West Africa I find evidence of a mixed impact from the adoption of universally recognised governance mechanisms. Higher levels of retained director ownership increase underpricing in contrast to that of founders. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This work shows how tenets of agency theory can be linked with institutional analysis to improve their explanatory power in the context of an emerging country such as Brazil. This study assessed the authors' propositions in a single-case analysis of a Brazilian multiple family firm. The results show that in the initial phase, characterized by less severe agency problems, the firm's competitive advantage matured, supported by the strong presence of trust derived from an extended family structure. As the company grew in complexity, the informal monitoring mechanisms that characterize collectivist societies allowed agency problems to escalate. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Previous studies have reported the relationship between corporate governance and corporate liquidity (cash holdings). Factors affecting corporate governance, such as securities laws and control of corruption, should have bearing on corporate liquidity and its value. This study focuses on national-level predictors of cash holdings such as securities laws and control of corruption and examines their impact on corporate liquidity, as well as its value from the agency perspective.Research Findings/Insights: Using comprehensive data on 47 countries from 1996-2007, this study demonstrates that when benchmark variables are controlled, corporate liquidity is lower in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption. In addition, cash can increase firm value. This positive relation is more pronounced in countries with effective securities laws or high control of corruption. Furthermore, excess cash can reduce firm value in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption as opposed to other countries; however, this value-reducing effect can be mitigated or reversed when control of corruption or securities laws improve.Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study establishes that securities laws and control of corruption, in addition to the traditional cash determinants, play important roles in determining corporate liquidity and its value, and should therefore not be ignored in future liquidity studies. In addition, securities laws and control of corruption reinforce each other in the reduction of internal agency problems. Furthermore, this study provides empirical support for agency theory to explain corporate cash holdings.Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multinational firms should consider the potential impact of different securities laws and control of corruption of foreign countries in deciding the amount of cash to hold. Results suggest that firms should decrease target cash level in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption because investor protection is stronger, and the agency problem is less severe. In addition, excess cash should not be held in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption because these circumstances can reduce firm value, unless these countries substantially improve their control of corruption or securities laws. As for policy makers, caution has to be exercised when improving securities laws or repressing corruption; the concurrent improvement of both is more effective for stronger investor protection and better corporate governance.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of independent directors and ownership structure on voluntary disclosures of Vietnamese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach Year-ending 2008 annual report disclosures of 45 Vietnamese listed firms are analyzed. Voluntary disclosure is measured using a Vietnamese Disclosure Index adapted from prior literature. Descriptive and inferential statistics (ITT/IT-test, analysis of variance, multiple regressions (ordinary least squares)) are employed to generate empirical insights. Findings The results indicate that the level of voluntary disclosure among Vietnamese listed firms is relatively low (24.23 per cent). There are higher levels of disclosure relating to director and senior management details but far lower in regards to social issues. State ownership and managerial ownership are negatively and positively related to the extent of voluntary disclosure respectively. Moreover, bigger firms are found to be positively associated with voluntary disclosure. Research limitations/ implications The results of this study are limited to one year 2008 and thus, could be biased as disclosures can change over time. Practical implications Vietnamese regulators should focus on strengthening the regulations governing the level of corporate communication in firms with high state ownership as well as encouraging more disclosure of non-financial information to strengthen its market information transparency. Originality/value This study is one of the first examining the level of corporate voluntary disclosure practices among Vietnamese listed firms. Evidence from this study extends the existing voluntary disclosure literature on emerging economies whilst providing valuable insights to Vietnamese policy makers in the process of developing and improving its financial reporting regulatory framework.

This paper examines the performance effects of family ownership and influence on board structure and its composition in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the North African region. Using a unique and comprehensive hand-collected sample of 63 locally listed IPO firm's from across North Africa we find considerable evidence of a sizeable differential between family and non-family controlled firms. I find considerable evidence supporting increased participation of family members at board level while contrastingly the wider dispersion of family ownership facilitates monitoring and surveillance and mitigates underpricing. Equally in line with the extended network and relationships involved in family firms business angels provide the optimal form of governance in contrast to the more formal private equity and venture capital industry.

Hedge funds tend to be highly activist investors who exercise their "principal power" over their portfolio firms. We observe that, compared to other investor types, hedge funds appear to be even more activist than is predicted by a comprehensive Investor Activism Model, due to the unexpectedly large role of several antecedent variables. This conclusion suggests that the relatively lightly regulated environment of hedge funds affects the weighting of conventional activism-antecedent variables. We explore how their access to several investing and trading strategies is allowing hedge funds to redefine investor activism. In the process, we find that, while hedge funds and their activism tend to benefit fellow investors, the potential exists for some specific hedge fund types to expropriate value from minority shareholders, creating "principal-principal" conflict. The potentially detrimental impact of hedge fund activism on other equity investors is demonstrated, illuminating several current policy concerns. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the governance role of private equity (PE) firms in post-LBO companies in the US. We propose and test whether PE firms remove entrenched CEOs or CEOs who cause agency problems. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 126 PE sponsored LBOs in the USA between 1990 and 2006, we document a CEO turnover rate of 51 per cent within two years of an LBO announcement. We find that the boards of directors replace CEOs in companies with high agency costs, as measured by low leverage and a high level of undistributed free cash flow. In addition, unlike the boards of directors in public companies, the boards in post-LBO companies tend to replace entrenched CEOs. Finally, the boards are more likely to replace CEOs if pre-LBO return on assets is low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: According to the agency theory, a PE-sponsored LBO is a new organizational form that reduces agency costs by enhancing corporate governance. This study uses CEO turnover as a setting to test that prediction. We find that PE firms replace CEOs who can cause agency problems, thus providing empirical support for the proposition that PE firms improve corporate governance in LBO companies. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in regulating PE firms. Our results suggest that, in the US, PE firms provide effective corporate governance mechanisms by replacing incompetent and entrenched CEOs. In addition, our results provide a set of factors for PE firms to consider when they make CEO retention decisions. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper examines the interrelations among ownership, board and manager characteristics and firm performance in a sample of 54 firms listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). These governance characteristics, designed to minimize agency problems between principals and agents are operationalized in terms of ownership concentration, ownership identity, board effectiveness and managerial discretion. The typical ownership identities at the NSE are government, foreign, institutional, manager and diverse ownership forms. Firm performance is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Yield (DY). Using PPMC, Logistic Regression and Stepwise Regression, the paper presents evidence of significant positive relationship between foreign, insider, institutional and diverse ownership forms, and firm performance. However, the relationship between ownership concentration and government, and firm performance was significantly negative. The role of boards was found to be of very little value, mainly due to lack of adherence to board member selection criteria. The results also show significant positive relationship between managerial discretion and performance. Collectively, these results are consistent with pertinent literature with regard to the implications of government, foreign, manager (insider) and institutional ownership forms, but significantly differ concerning the effects of ownership concentration and diverse ownership on firm performance.

Agency theory provides a valuable lens for understanding the role and importance of many varied governance mechanisms. We argue that transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a complementary theoretical lens for studying corporate governance because it illuminates the various contingencies that moderate the importance of alternative governance mechanisms. Using agency theory, we argue and find evidence that the confluence of advancing CEO age and large CEO stock holdings will cause the CEO to become overly risk-averse. Moreover, we use TCE to more fully explicate the ensuing performance consequences as well as the contextual factors that critically moderate this relationship. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We examined CEO attributes, board composition, and ownership structure for their relationship to the share performance of the acquiring company around the acquisition announcement. Based on 273 acquisitions by Canadian firms from 1998 through 2002, we have shown that the levels of CEO and director ownership as well as the level of board independence were positively associated with the short-term financial performance of the acquirer. Board size was negatively related to value creation. Finally, cash-based deals and cross-border transactions were also positively related to increases in shareholder wealth for the acquirer.

This paper examines the impact of ownership structure on the voluntary disclosure in the annual reports of Malaysian listed firms. The result shows that there is an increase in the extent of voluntary disclosure in Malaysian listed firms over the eleven-year period from 1996 to 2006. Ownership concentration consistently shows positive association with voluntary disclosure. Firms with higher foreign and institutional ownership have a significantly positive association with voluntary disclosure levels while firms with family ownership exhibit lower voluntary disclosure. Consistent with agency theory, different ownership structures have varied monitoring effects on agency costs and clearly influence firm's disclosure practices. The findings provide insights to policy makers and regulators in their desire to increase transparency and accountability amidst the continual enhancement of corporate governance. The findings provide evidence that optimized ownership structure in any jurisdiction should be considered in any regulatory process that seeks to improve transparency.

Purpose - This research seeks to investigate the role of key corporate governance mechanisms in determining a firm's post-bankruptcy performance following reorganisation. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on agency theory and uses a unique sample of 111 filing companies whose reorganisation plans have been confirmed by the Thai Central Bankruptcy Court during the period 1999-2002. Findings - The results indicate that monitoring and incentive mechanisms are significant determinants of a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. The key monitoring mechanism is ownership concentration, measured by shares held by the largest shareholder, whereas the critical incentive mechanisms are cash compensation and percentage of common shares held by the plan administrator. The results indicate that these mechanisms can mitigate agency problems in previously insolvent companies and increase post-bankruptcy performance over a three year period. Originality/value - The study is timely given that many organisations are facing rebuilding programs following the impact of the global financial crisis. Prior research in Thailand and elsewhere has not measured bankruptcy reorganisation outcomes in terms of the difference of actual financial performance to predicted performance and in relation to the governance factors of the reorganisation process. Neither has this aspect been considered within an agency theory framework. This provides a unique opportunity to consider these variables based on the theoretical framework of agency theory and to evaluate the importance of governance mechanisms in reorganisation proceedings.

We examine the design of control rights of external financiers, and how these interact with the firm's security issuance and capital structure when the firm's initial owners and managers may disagree with new investors over project choice. The first main result is an ex ante managerial preference for "soft" financial claims that maximize managerial project-choice autonomy, which is in contrast to agency theory. Second, a dynamic "pecking order" of cash, equity, and debt emerges. Additional results explain equity issuance at high prices, the drifting of leverage ratios with stock returns, cash hoarding, and debt usage without taxes, agency, or signaling. (c) 2011 The Author.

This book provides a framework for the study of financial ethics built on a broad review of research published in finance and economics journals. This book demonstrates that ethics is already an important part of financial research, and therefore the approach taken here is more of a "rediscovery" of the ethical dimension of financial economics. The book adopts a positivist framework for the field of financial ethics within which it is proposed that many "finance" problems are actually "ethics" problems; and that many economic phenomena can be explained as mechanisms for controlling moral risks. The text discusses several examples in which an ethics-centered approach to understanding economic phenomena is similar in spirit to other frameworks which have been applied in positive financial research including: the framework used for understanding corporate governance mechanisms as devices for mitigating agency costs and "moral hazards" in contractual relationships; the transaction "governance structure" framework that can explain the existence of hierarchies relative to markets when opportunistic behavior is assumed; and the roles of reputation and corporate culture in making credible commitments of trust in exchange. The book argues that these "financial ethical technologies" are not mutually exclusive but, rather, mutually enriching ways to deepen our understanding of the same economic phenomena. They are financial technologies because they enhance economic value; and, they are ethical technologies because their value enhancing contributions are produced by mitigating moral risks in exchange.

In response to equity compensation contracts that encourage managers to commit fraud as well as provide productive effort, ownersmay choose to monitor the manager to limit the fraud. We examine the firm owners' incentives to perform both ex ante monitoring, such as internal controls, and ex post monitoring, such as audits, in a model that includes the reputational damages caused when a fraud is discovered. We provide conditions under which the owner prefers either more or less monitoring, and examine the effect of additional monitoring on the optimal equity package and equilibrium level of fraud.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Controlling shareholders who are normally also the executive directors tend to set their own levels of remuneration as a means of expropriating minority shareholders. This study tests the relationship between ownership concentration and executive remuneration, using panel data for a sample of 191 Malaysian public listed companies over the 2002-2007 period. This study finds a non linear relationship between share ownership of executive directors and their levels of salary by using the fixed-effects (FE) model. The model exhibits a negative, positive and negative relationship which corresponds to the occurrence of convergence-of-interests, managerial entrenchment, and convergence-of-interests effects. The positive relationship between 23 to 76 per cent between executive ownership and salary for levels of executive ownership indicates the existence of expropriation. Despite the occurrence of expropriation, salary and remuneration received by executive directors are positively related to market-to-book ratio. A positive association is also found between bonus paid to executive directors and firm's accounting profits. Independent non executive directors and the remuneration committee are able to exert a downward effect on directors' remuneration and bonus. But external blockholders do not possess such an influence in reining in the salary, bonus, or remuneration of executive directors.

This paper offers an agency-based explanation for the junior priority status of convertible bonds. Using a simple economic model, I show that when convertible and straight debt have equal priority, shareholders can prefer value-decreasing projects, which results in wealth transfers from bondholders to shareholders; and I prove that this problem is solved when convertible debt is subordinated. Empirical evidence supports the theory. I find that firms with greater potential for investment-based agency conflicts are more likely to issue subordinated convertible debt, and firms with senior convertible debt are more likely to deviate from the optimal investment policy.

This study examines Indonesian Accounting Regulatory Compliance measurement (IARCm) and Indonesian Accounting Regulatory Compliance disclosure (IARCd) through an agency theory-based analysis of 220 Indonesian listed companies' 2006 annual reports. To measure the level of regulatory compliance of Indonesian listed companies, this study uses a 29 item index derived from Indonesian accounting standards on inventory, fixed assets and depreciation. Analysis reveals a moderate level of 69.70% measurement and 54.20% disclosure compliance with accounting rules. Statistical analysis shows that firm size is the best predictor of compliance. Surprisingly, corporate governance factors fail to explain compliance. However, more profitable firms do demonstrate increased measurement compliance. Although Indonesian firms may have complied with more than 50% of the key accounting rule provisions, regulatory intervention is still strongly advocated for making Indonesian firms fully comply with Indonesian accounting regulations.

Purpose: There are two purposes of this study. First, it aims to discuss some measures managers would take on the basis of an empirical case study - Dell's pricing mistakes on the web site - and find out the underlying motivation regarding consumers' attitude toward Dell. Second, there appears to be a fruitful opportunity to explore whether consumers' requests or different degrees of compensation will have any impact on organizational reputation (intangible assets). Design/methodology/approach: The survey investigates consumers' attitude toward the Dell crisis case, including how and why it affected the reputation of the company. The main questionnaire survey was conducted after the Dell pricing mistakes. In total, 433 samples were found valid and kept for further examination. The study tests the proposed hypotheses by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: By taking Dell's pricing mistake on the web site as an example, the study finds that managers sometimes opt for solutions unfavorable to the whole organization, in order to ensure self interest, including over quota coupons to reimburse consumers, which would be harmful to other stakeholders. Managers face not only consumers' interests but also other stakeholders' as well as corporate intangible assets. Also, consumers have different backgrounds and these characteristics will exercise influence on perceived crisis management. Originality/value: Although the academic literature has given much attention to the internet issues or crisis management, little attention seems to have been paid to the crisis potential coming from the internet. The power of consumers may hugely increase in the internet age and make the crisis graver, because the internet changes the ability of external commentators to make their opinions widely known, and hurts the reputation of corporations more deeply. A major theoretical contribution of this study is comprehension and filling the gaps in the existing literature. Agency theory and stakeholders' view provides a logical explanation of how and why these things happened. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

In this issue, Miller and Sardais challenge the established wisdom that agents are preordained to play costly villains in their contracts with shareholders in modern corporations. The key exhibit in support of their assertion is an angel agent in the form of Pierre Lefaucheux, the CEO of Regie Renault in early postwar France. Lefaucheux is shown to be a model agent, refreshingly free of the symptoms that afflict the archetypal economic agent of neoclassical agency theory. In this counterpoint, I provide a more restrained view of angel agents, question their wider presence and argue that one angel agent does not negate the overall theory of agency, and conclude by noting that the angel agent model has never really gained wide currency. Finally, I note that the inability of Renault to remain profitable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s raises questions about the longevity of programs left in place by well-intentioned angel agents.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

The study investigates the change in performance of French public firms post to their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and its relationship with the changes in the managerial ownership around the time firms to their IPOs. We develop three hypotheses: (1) Agency theory, (2) Entrenchment, (3) Curve-linear link between managerial ownership and firm performance. Tests are conducted on a sample of 65 companies going public during 2000 to 2006 on the Paris stock exchange. Overall, we observe an average decrease in managerial ownership and accounting performance two years after going public. The majority of our results show there is a significant negative relation between post-IPO change in performance and equity detention by the managerial ownership. Therefore, the most of the results are opposed to the predictions resulting from the assumption of agency (alignment of interests) but contribute to retain the entrenchment hypothesis and specially the assumption of the timing in the sense that it is beneficial for manager to plan the introduction at a time when performance is particularly high to ensure its success. This facilitates later, his entrenchment. Accordingly, a steeper decline in performance after IPO for the group of companies, where owner-managers hold a large share of ownership. Some of our results support the alignment of interest hypothesis. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study aims at examining the relationship between largest blockholding and firm economic performance in Bangladesh, an emerging economy. It is found that there is a significant positive relationship between the largest blockholding and firm performance under both the accounting and market based performance measures. This study reveals that, largest blockholding, by narrowing the gap between ownership and control, allows the blockholder to add value to the firm. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

This paper examines the performance effects arising from initial primary offering (IPO) firms retaining their existing bank as a lead manager together with the effects of foreign and domestic lead managers, corporate insiders and private equity investors across West Africa. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm's from across West Africa, I find evidence of a considerable reduction in underpricing and costs of equity in firms listing on civil code as opposed to common law markets. Furthermore, I find evidence that firms employing their existing bank as lead manager have higher costs of equity while the employment of a foreign as opposed to domestic lead manager imparts a reduction in underpricing and cost of equity.

The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance.

This study investigates the impacts of family presence and board independence on corporate financial performance in 131 large listed firms from India, an emerging economy dominated by the presence of large business groups having concentrated ownership. Family presence includes the extent of family ownership and appointment of family CEO and family chairperson. Employing a multiple linear regression model, this study first detects a positive relationship between family ownership and financial performance. Second, a negative relationship is found between family CEO and firm performance, indicating that family firms with non-family CEOs perform better than firms having family CEOs. Third, the proportion of Board outsiders ' (i.e. independent non-family directors) is found to have no significant relation to financial performance, thus challenging agency theory's need for independent monitoring in family firms to enhance performance. These results are interpreted in the context of historical Indian family business practices and modern changes.

Based on the framework of Agency Theory II, we focus on the private benefit of large shareholder's control right and construct a model which can illustrate how M&A decision can be impacted by acquirer's equity structure. The model internalizes large shareholder's private benefit as a function of the shareholding ratio and specifies the mechanism through which large shareholder's shareholding ratio and ownership concentration impact the M&A decision. This paper provides theoretical foundation for those empirical literatures which analyze the M&As from the perspective of Agency Theory II. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Based on agency theory, this study discusses how a firm arranges its controlling shareholders' shares in order to eliminate the expropriation on minority shareholders. The study finds that the controlling shareholders' shares should at least exceed some proportion. The stronger the level of internal monitoring is, the higher the quality of external governance mechanism is, the lower the lowest controlling shareholders' shares to eliminate expropriation will be required. The study also finds that the internal and external corporate governance mechanism can be complemented each other, and co-determine the lowest controlling shareholders' shares required to eliminate expropriation. In addition, the ability of controlling shareholders to obtain private benefits has also an important impact on the required lowest controlling shareholders' shares. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

Combining insights from the agency theory and sociopolitical perspectives, this study examines the extent to which factors such as ownership structure, CEO power, and firm performance influence firms' adoption of board independent reform advocated by shareholder activists. Event history analysis using extensive data on 1083 Standard & Poor's 1500 companies from January 2002 to December 2004 shows that firms with more powerful CEO were less likely to adopt supermajority-independent boards, while both poorly performing firms and large firms were more likely to adopt such board structure. We also find that higher institutional blockholder ownership increased the likelihood of the adoption in firms managed by less powerful CEOs, while external non-institutional blockholder ownership decreased the likelihood of the adoption.

Corporate governance is a set of practices and processes of board and executives coordination and control that aims at protecting the interests of shareholders and others affected by the value of the company. The discussions and disputes involving shareholders in Brazil and a new corporate law aimed at improving governance practices in the country, reducing the cost of capital of the company and contributing to national economic growth. In this study, we compared the theoretical evidence on the governance structure of airlines with the reality of a large company in the sector in Brazil. The results indicate that a wrong architecture of ownership and control combined with the non-corporate governance system may result in financial distress for an organization.

There is a world trend to reinforce the regulation of financial markets and of public sector enterprises, as a means to protect the interests of the principal. One way to reduce investor exposure is to improve corporate governance practices in businesses which use public funds. This article analyses the following questions in the light of the agency theory: Will best corporate government practices protect investors? Are there differences in the short and long term? Does regulation designed to improve corporate government help to improve and capital structure? In the long- and short-term in the Mexican financial market, and globalization, privileged information and convergence between Mexican businesses and their foreign counterparts seem to have an influence on risk and yield.

The present work summarizes the theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. From a theory-based perspective we integrate evolutionary psychology and agency theory and describe how conflicting predictions can be made regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. Similarly, we describe how the empirical landscape is equally conflicted. Findings from this meta-analysis summarize the observed effects from multiple studies and provide an estimate of the relation across the entire population. Results illustrated that family involvement did not significantly impact firms' financial performance (r= .006). Based on these data, there is no relation between family involvement and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we examined multiple conceptual and methodologically-based potential moderating influences-none was statistically significant. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for multiple new areas of inquiry as the domain of family business studies evolves. Moving forward, we advise future research in this area to search for additional moderator effects and explore the defining characteristics, other than performance, that make family businesses distinct from non-family businesses.

We challenge critics of agency theory who suggest that agency theory's value does not extend outside a narrow context dominated by egocentric agents seeking only to maximize wealth at the expense of the principal. Instead, we argue that agency theory's flexibility allows for its application to a variety of non-traditional settings where the key elements of agency theory, such as self-interest, information asymmetry, and the mechanisms used to control agency costs can vary beyond the narrow assumptions implied in traditional agency-based research. We suggest that extending agency theory to diverse settings using a deductive approach can be accomplished by formally recognizing and incorporating the institutional context surrounding principal-agent (P-A) relations into agency-based models. Thus, criticisms that agency theory fails to acknowledge the social context in which P-A relations occur provides not a barrier but an opportunity for extending our understanding of P-A relations to a variety of diverse contexts.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on their technological innovation performance. First, we have examined whether ownership concentration positively influences technological innovation performance. Then we have investigated the primary reasons for the results derived from the first stage of our analysis by circumstantially exploring the impacts of four different ownership types. Research Findings/Insights: Using five sets of cross-sectional data, consisting of 301 Korean firms, we found that ownership concentration does not have a significant effect on firm technological innovation performance. However, some ownership types (e.g., institutional and foreign) do have a positive effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective, our paper is the first to consider a comprehensive treatment of the effect of ownership types on innovation in an emerging country, in particular in contrast to previous studies that have focused on advanced economies. Since only partial predictions suggested by agency and resource dependence perspectives were supported, it appears that neither theory adequately captures the ownership-technological innovation performance relationship. Thus, we suggest that future research should explore the question through a different theoretical lens to better understand the impact of ownership types. We suggest that transaction cost economics can be another path to approach the phenomenon. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure (types) influences the building of firm-specific capabilities for innovation. Policy makers and managers should be aware of the impact of the complete range of ownership types on technological innovation performance when they implement corporate governance reform with greater effectiveness. It also suggests that successful technological catch-up and innovation not only require policies for upgrading technology capabilities, but also the setting up of a suitable supporting ownership structure that favors innovation of firms in emerging countries. We suggest that successful technological catch-up and innovation require a supporting ownership structure. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Questions: This study investigates the determination of Chinese CEO pay. We focus on three related questions: (1) Is Chinese CEO pay related to firm performance? (2) Are CEO pay dynamics important? (3) Does corporate governance affect CEO pay and equity incentives in China? Research Findings: Using data on CEO compensation in China's public traded firms from 2000 to 2010, we document significant changes in CEO pay, ownership and board structure. We document that CEO pay is positively correlated to both accounting and stock market performance, although the link to accounting performance is more robust. We find that CEO pay dynamics are important as pay in the current year is significantly positively correlated to CEO pay the previous year. We also find that CEO equity ownership and equity grants are influenced by board and ownership structure. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study supplements the standard agency theory approach to executive compensation with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory developed in the labor economics field. It predicts that incomplete information and learning lead to adjustment costs and non-instantaneous changes in CEO pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance within transition economies.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the issue of forced CEO turnover in China and summarizes the economic consequences of political connections within the framework of corporate governance. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large sample of listed firms in China from 2005 to 2008, we find that politically connected CEOs are less likely to be fired and that the sensitivity of forced turnover to firm performance is weaker for connected CEOs than for their non-connected peers. This suggests that CEOs in a transition economy tend to use their political resources for their own good. We also find a significantly positive relationship between the political connections of retained CEOs and future firm performance only when firm profitability is below the industry median. These findings suggest that the value of political connections is contingent on a firm's operating performance, and that the benefits of political connections may outweigh their costs when firms do not meet their profitability targets. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study is the first to examine how the political ties of CEOs relate to their forced turnover. It integrates agency theory with resource dependence theory and contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of political connections in emerging markets. It also takes a step toward reconciling the mixed evidence for the effects of political connections on firm performance by demonstrating a sharp difference between firms under different operating statuses. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in improving corporate governance in transitional economies such as China, where CEOs have close connections with the government. It also provides a deep perspective for the boards in politically connected firms, allowing them to deal with the relationship between top management and the government in a healthy way.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: In this paper we discuss three assumptions of agency theory: (1) conflicts of interest between principal and agent, (2) nature of risk, and (3) the proposed internal mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We review criticisms of agency theory's pessimistic assumptions of human behavior and its simplistic view about individual risk preferences to argue how the context may influence both the interest and mechanisms for aligning interest of principals and agents. Research Findings/Insights: We draw on alternative theoretical perspectives from behavioral and organizational sciences to describe circumstances under which honesty, loyalty, and trust in agents' behaviors are possible and also the development of cooperative rather than contentious relationships. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We investigate how ownership structure, board characteristics, and regional differences in law enforcement and stock market development affect the conflict of interest between majority and minority investors in Chinese listed firms. For this purpose, we study related-party transactions as well as labor redundancy, and classify firms as either state- or private-controlled. Research Findings/Insights: We find that related-party transactions grow more extensive as the wedge between the controlling shareholder's control rights and cash flow rights increases. Related-party transactions also rise with voting rights held by the government in state-controlled firms. Next, the state as controlling shareholder exacerbates labor redundancy. The control rights of the second to tenth largest investors can offset expropriation. Regarding board characteristics, we find that a larger fraction of directors affiliated with the dominant owner enlarges related-party transactions, while large boards also increase labor redundancy in state-controlled firms. We find only weak evidence that higher-quality institutions help to restrain expropriation of minority investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In Chinese listed firms, a major conflict of interest arises between majority and minority investors. Also, the state may exercise its control rights to achieve imperative social and political objectives, to the detriment of external investors. Yet, as the stock market valuation and financial performance of state-controlled firms rise with the fraction of shares held by the state, future research should better delineate the conditions under which state ownership is either detrimental or beneficial to firms. Next, the results indicate that governance mechanisms suggested by conventional agency theory are deficient in Chinese listed firms. Future research could therefore establish more clearly when internal and external governance mechanisms are likely to work, thereby also taking into account the identity of the controlling shareholder. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors should be aware that expropriation in Chinese listed firms has specific implications when the state is the controlling owner. Also, at this stage of development, independent directors and external governance mechanisms can hardly protect the best interests of minority investors. Rather, expropriation is counterbalanced when voting rights are concentrated in the hands of other large block holders. Policy makers should work on ownership restructuring, board independence, and institutional quality to better protect minority rights in Chinese listed firms. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We offer an institution-based view to the classic inquiry on the relationship between family business and firm performance, which has been dominated by traditional theories such as agency theory and the resource-based view.

Our research contributes to a reconciliation of prior inconsistent findings and calls further attention to the embedded nature of family business in institutions.

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores how capital structure is influenced by aggregate corporate governance quality. We measure governance quality using broad-based comprehensive governance metrics provided by the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The empirical evidence reveals a robust inverse association between leverage and governance quality. Firms with poor governance are significantly more leveraged. It appears that leverage substitutes for corporate governance in alleviating agency conflicts. Further, we utilize empirical methods that control for endogeneity and show that poor governance quality likely brings about, and does not merely reflect, higher leverage. Our results are important as they show that the overall quality of corporate governance has a material impact on critical corporate decisions such as capital structure choices. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study investigates the role of ownership and control structure of firms when determining their cash holdings and focuses mainly on the association between excess control rights and cash holdings. Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly listed companies from 1997 to 2009, this study shows that the relationship between excess control rights and cash holdings depends on each firm's characteristics in terms of quantile regression. Fewer excess control rights affect cash holdings positively in low cash holding firms but negatively in high cash holding firms. Additional analysis reveals that when a family member serves as the CEO in low cash holding firms, the amount of cash holding is greater than if the CEO is an outsider. However, family members holding the position of CEO affect cash holdings negatively in high cash holding firms. These results suggest that firms with less cash holdings stockpile more cash reserves to take advantage of investment opportunities. The objective of corporate governance for firms with more cash reserves is to ensure that firms decrease levels of cash to avoid agency problems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

How do managers react in an environment where bribery is likely to bring high rewards, but also presents high risks? We examine the supply side (firms' illicit payments) of bribery in a global setting, using the United Nations' (UN) Oil-for-Food Program, part of UN sanctions on Iraq. Some companies helped Iraq circumvent UN sanctions through bribe payments in the form of illicit surcharges. Our transaction-level analysis of factors affecting bribe payments draws on the economic theory of crime, agency theory, and home country institutions. Results suggest that firms pay larger bribes when there are stronger financial and managerial incentives, but pay less when their home countries have implemented the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. We find little relationship between a widely used country-level corruption perception index and firms' actual bribery. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We use agency theory to investigate the influence of CEO dominance on variation in capital structure. Due to agency conflicts, managers may not always adopt leverage choices that maximize shareholders' value. Consistent with the prediction of agency theory, the evidence reveals that, when the CEO plays a more dominant role among top executives, the firm adopts significantly lower leverage, probably to evade the disciplinary mechanisms associated with debt financing. Our results are important as they demonstrate that CEO power matters to critical corporate outcomes such as capital structure decisions. In addition, we find that the impact of changes in capital structure on firm performance is more negative for firms with more powerful CEOs. Overall, the results are in agreement with prior literature, suggesting that strong CEO dominance appears to exacerbate agency costs and is thus detrimental to firm value.

Researchers in international business have long been interested in understanding the impact of internationalization on performance and innovation. However, prior studies of this research stream offer mixed results. This study contributes to this research stream by employing agency theory to investigate how ownership concentration affects the performance and innovation implications of internationalization. Specifically, we examine two primary effects of ownership concentration: the incentive alignment effect, proxied by the controlling shareholder's cash flow rights, and the entrenchment effect, proxied by the divergence between control rights and cash flow rights of the controlling shareholder. Based on a sample of Taiwan's publicly listed firms, we find that the incentive alignment effect moderates the relation between internationalization and performance and innovation positively and the entrenchment effect moderates the relation negatively. These findings shed light on the mixed results of the literature. In addition, most countries outside the United States and the United Kingdom have high ownership concentration; therefore, our results may be generalizable to other settings, providing insight into the role of corporate governance in internationalization.

Recent perspectives on community investments suggest that they are opportunities for firms to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders. However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U. S. corporations. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study draws on agency and stewardship theory to evaluate the relationship between alternative governance regimes (founder versus non-founder CEO) adopted at the time of going public on post-IPO economic outcomes in the market for corporate control. We find that the presence of founder CEOs reduces the likelihood of post-IPO change of control but enhances target IPO firm wealth by increasing acquisition premiums. Additionally, we examine whether measures of CEO power over the board moderate the relationship between founder management and target IPO firm wealth. Our results suggest that CEO duality is the most effective instrument of CEO power available to founder CEOs to positively influence target firm wealth. Further, we find that while founder CEOs utilize power derived from CEO duality to increase acquisition premiums, non-founder CEOs use board leadership power to expropriate shareholder wealth.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether corporate governance plays a role in influencing a firm's choice of financing, i.e., equity versus debt. We hypothesize that the likelihood of equity financing increases with governance because of a reduction in agency costs between investors and managers in these firms. While the reduction in agency costs occurs for both equity and debt financing, we argue that there is a more significant effect on equity financing. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of over 2,000 US equity and debt issuances over the period 1998 to 2006, we find that our measures of corporate governance effectiveness have a positive impact on the likelihood of choosing equity compared to debt. This association is more pronounced in small firms where information asymmetry is higher between managers and investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings refine and extend the pecking order hypothesis, which suggests that firms will issue equity as their last resort because of the high information asymmetry associated with equity financing. We provide some of the first evidence that the pecking order hypothesis can be mitigated by corporate governance. Specifically, we find that the likelihood of issuing equity increases as governance increases. Further, we find that where agency costs due to information asymmetry are greater, the positive impact of governance on the likelihood of equity financing is also greater. That is, in support of agency cost theory, we find that firms facing high agency costs benefit the most from investing in corporate governance mechanisms that lower the agency costs. We are not aware of any prior study, published or unpublished, that has documented this result. Practitioner/Policy Implications: From a practical perspective, our study suggests that firms wishing to access equity capital markets should pay attention to their corporate governance. Specifically, by investing in corporate governance systems, firms facing high agency costs may be able to obtain easier access to not just debt but also equity markets. From a practice standpoint, in the years prior to securing financing, firms should consider making improvements to their governance (e.g., changes to board structure and/or auditor), carefully weighing the costs of making these improvements against the benefits of securing better and cheaper access to equity markets.

Family firms without able and willing family successors are frequently sold to non-family managers through management buy-outs (MBOs). Whether MBOs create value is thought to be dependent upon the ability to reduce owner-manager agency costs. In this article we examine the agency costs of MBOs that acquire family firms. We contribute to theory by arguing that in such situations, value creation by reducing agency costs will depend upon pre-MBO agency costs, the ability to solve the double agency problem, and the relationship between the cost of agency control mechanisms and the residual losses from opportunism before and after the MBO.

The comply-or-explain principle is a common feature of corporate governance codes. While prior studies investigated compliance with corporate governance codes as well as the effects of compliance on firm behaviour and performance, explanations for deviations from a corporate governance code remain largely unexamined. This paper intends to fill that gap. The paper draws on the voluntary disclosure literature and agency theory to examine the association between firm characteristics and the informativeness of explanations for deviations from the Dutch corporate governance code. Applying content analysis to corporate governance statements for a sample of Dutch listed firms for the period 2005-2009, the study finds that ownership concentration and number of analysts following the firm are positively associated with informativeness. Furthermore, there is indicative evidence that board strength and informativeness are positively associated. The study also finds a negative association between leverage and informativeness. Institutional investors, however, do not seem to affect this type of disclosure. Taken together, the findings suggest that certain firm characteristics are associated with a firm's choice to provide either generic and uninformative explanations or more firm-specific and informative explanations. On the basis of the study's findings, I argue that firms having weaker boards, firms followed by fewer analysts, firms having more dispersed ownership and firms relying more on debt finance tend to approach comply-or-explain more symbolically than substantively.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity and disentangle the effects of agency problems of free cash flow and asymmetric information. Excess control rights and board independence may moderate the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity by changing agency costs. Research Findings/Insights: Family control lessens investment-cash flow sensitivity by mitigating the problem of asymmetric information. Investment-cash flow sensitivity will be higher in family-controlled firms with excess control rights because Type II agency problems predominate. Family control may affect investment-cash flow sensitivity when firms lack independent directors. Having another blockholder in addition to the controlling family reduces the agency problem and improves the independent monitoring function of the board for family-controlled firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides a better understanding of the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity. It delineates the separate effects of agency problems stemming from free cash flow and asymmetric information and demonstrates that excess control rights and board independence can moderate the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity. We show the significant role another blockholder plays in internal governance mechanisms. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors can better gauge firm value by examining the type of company control and linkages between investment distortion and firm value. Policy makers can better understand how excess control and board independence act as mechanisms to worsen or mitigate the effects of family control. Managers can understand the effects of control type and board independence on the firm's financial constraints. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We use agency theory to explore how analyst coverage is influenced by the managerial entrenchment associated with the staggered board. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards attract significantly larger analyst following. We also document that firms with staggered boards experience less information asymmetry. Staggered boards insulate managers from the discipline of the takeover market. Entrenched managers are well-protected by the staggered board and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in less information asymmetry. The more transparent information environment facilitates the analyst's job. As a consequence, more analysts are attracted to firms with staggered boards. We also document the beneficial role of analyst coverage in improving firm value. Our results confirm the notion that analysts, as information intermediaries, provide oversight over management and thus help alleviate agency conflicts. The positive effect of analyst coverage, however, is severely reduced when the firm has a staggered board in place. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under-investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross-country differences. Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand-collected questionnaire-based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment-specific factors. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm. Non-state-controlled (dispersedly controlled and privately controlled) firms are more likely to have enhanced post-transformation performance and reduced agency costs than state-controlled firms.

The "China concepts stock" in the U.S. has attracted a great deal of attention among international investors due to the fast growth in Chinese economy. This paper examines the aftermarket performance and the motivations to list in the U.S. for Chinese firms over 1993-2010 by considering the great impact of split-share structure reform in China. We find that the Chinese firms in the U.S. generally underperform the benchmark and industry peers in the post-IPO period of 3 years. The Chinese cross-listing ADRs show superior performance relative to the single-listings in the long run. It seems that more stringent listing requirements and accounting standards help to improve the corporate governance and operating performance of the Chinese firms. The evidence also supports that the Chinese issuers are motivated to cross-list in the U.S. due to over-investment incentives, leverage effects or free-cash-flow signaling, which is consistent with agency theory and signaling hypothesis.

Despite the substantial growth of IT investments, evidence on their impact on firm performance remains inconclusive. An important management question is whether anticipated economic benefits of IT investments are being realized. The intangible benefits obtained from IT are not captured by accrual-based accounting measures alone, and, therefore, call for a comprehensive measure that focuses on segments of performance influenced by IT investments. This study proposes a framework that utilizes nonfinancial measures to link IT investments to their intangible benefits and applies the agency theory to examine the contribution of IT investments by tying managerial compensation to firm value.

Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.

Based on agency theory, ownership structure plays a role in monitoring managerial opportunistic behaviour. This study examines how different forms of ownership structures including foreign ownership, government ownership, and managerial ownership moderate the relationship between free cash flow and asset utilisation. This cross-sectional study involves companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis show a negative relationship between free cash flow and asset utilisation. This finding indicates that free cash flow may be invested unproductively, thus contributing to inefficient usage of assets. This study has also empirically demonstrated that foreign and managerial ownership provides monitoring on the use of the companies' assets, especially in companies with high free cash flow. The findings contribute to the understanding of the role of the various dimensions of ownership structure in overseeing the use of the firm's assets.

The goal of this paper is to determine the factors that explain voluntary improvements in audit committee activity, independence and financial expertise, both individually and jointly, within a corporate governance environment other than those used in previous works. These audit committee characteristics have been selected because previous authors have found that these attributes improve the effectiveness of this monitoring committee. The findings included a relatively high level of the proxies of audit committee effectiveness for those companies which display the best practices in terms of their board of directors' independence and activities. At the same time, we observed a non-linear relationship of substitution among internal control mechanisms, management ownership and audit committee characteristics. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Low-quality firms may use share repurchase announcements to send a false or conflicting message regarding firm value to the capital market. This study examines whether firm-level corporate governance mechanisms can alleviate this mimicking behavior by affecting managers' buyback behavior following open-market share repurchase announcements. I further investigate the extent to which differences in corporate governance affect the changes in insider shareholdings and the degree of information content provided in repurchase announcements. Research Findings/Insights: Using unique archival data from Taiwan, I find that the capital market reaction to share repurchases announced for the purpose of signaling undervaluation is more favorable for firms with quality corporate governance. The increasing post-repurchase insider shareholdings confirm the credibility of repurchase announcements for firms with better corporate governance. The buyback outcome subsequent to repurchase announcements is affected by internal corporate governance mechanisms. Furthermore, external monitoring factors, such as having Big Four accounting firms as auditors, listing requirements, and regulatory preset buyback price ranges, also determine the execution rate of repurchase programs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The signaling hypothesis, the leading hypothesis on open-market share repurchases, suggests that low-quality firms may engage in mimicking behavior to send a false signal regarding firm value when the signal cost is low. This study provides insight regarding the impacts of firm-level corporate governance structures on the signaling effects of repurchase announcements, the subsequent insider shareholdings, and the completion of repurchase programs. In addition, this study is the first to analyze the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on the degree of information content in open-market share repurchase announcements. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that higher quality corporate governance mechanisms lend credibility to a firm's open-market share repurchase announcement, which is also noteworthy in assessing the wealth effect of the repurchase announcements on shareholder value. Moreover, the findings suggest that buyback regulations (e.g., preset buyback price ceiling and floor) in Taiwan influence managers' buyback decisions. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: Since the initiation of the share split reform by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in 2005, the private placement has become the major source of raising equity after IPO. The purpose of this paper is to investigate why listed firms in China prefer private placements compared to other options of raising capital. Design/methodology/approach: The ordinary least squares regression, the piecewise regression and the cross-sectional regression analysis were undertaken to investigate the determinants and characteristics of the seasoned-equity offerings announcement effects. Probit regression analysis was taken to estimate the probability of a firm choosing private placements. Findings: The authors find positive significant announcement abnormal returns for private placement. The findings also indicate that operating performance deteriorates immediately after announcement and poor operating performance is more likely to be contributed by large size portfolios, which suggests size effect. Research limitations/implications: The paper's evidence contributes to an understanding of the wider implication of the share split reform undertaken by the CSRC. Practical implications: The paper provides insights for policy makers in China and around the world who have and wish to adopt similar practices within their jurisdictions. Similar research can be conducted in other emerging markets to enable better understanding and implications of seasoned equity offerings on firm financial performance. Originality/value: The paper is novel in regard to the data and the wider research paradigm used. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We follow agency theory to assess the influence of managerial ownership on the market value, performance, and risk of 123 listed banks in 23 countries included in the STOXX Global Index in 2007 and 2010. After controlling for bank characteristics, regulatory restrictions, and macroeconomic conditions, our findings show a positive relation between managerial ownership and both market value (Tobin's Q) and performance (ROA and ROE). Moreover, we find a negative relation between managerial ownership and risk (EDF, NPL/L, and Z-SCORE). Bank market value and performance is a non-linear, inverse U-shaped function of managerial ownership. The negative relation between managerial ownership and bank risk is also non-linear and U-shaped. Our results remain robust to reverse causality. In their effort to immunize the global financial system from systemic risks, central banks and practitioners should find our results relevant for regulation purposes.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper studies whether enhanced regulatory supervision of the banking system strengthens the debt contracting mechanism between borrowers and lenders in emerging markets. Specifically, we investigate: 1) whether the borrowers' accrual-based earnings management behavior is more negatively associated with the magnitude of their bank loans after the government strengthens the monitoring on banks, and 2) whether the enhanced supervision is more effective for firms controlled by the state, the major economic player in most emerging markets. Research Findings/Insights: Using China's 2003 banking reform as a natural experiment, we find that borrowers' earnings management behavior becomes more negatively associated with loan size after the reform. The association is more significant for state-owned borrowers and lenders, consistent with the prediction that although the state-owned parties face lower barriers to collusion, the reform increases the costs of side-contracting. Overall, the findings suggest that such reform is effective in enhancing banks' role in corporate governance in a transition economy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: To date, most corporate governance studies are based on the standard principal-agent theory that analyzes contracting between only two parties. For this reason, the standard agency theory has had limited success in explaining economic developments in emerging markets, where the economy is characterized by high levels of government intervention (i.e., a third party), which creates the possibility of collusion. We study debt contracting in an emerging market by adopting the theory of collusion, an extension of the traditional principal-agent theory to multi-agent settings, such as one in which there are one principal and two agents, one of whom plays the role of supervisor. Our results show that, consistent with theoretical predictions, monitoring by the government (i.e., the principal) of banks (i.e., the supervisor) has an impact on the relationship between banks and borrowing firms (i.e., the agents). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Previous research on corporate governance in emerging markets, which has focused on the disciplining role of the equity holders, has documented that corporate governance is rather weak. As private lending is the most widely used type of financing in emerging markets such as China, this paper takes a different view and shows that private lending has increased its influence on firms' corporate governance since a banking reform. The results confirm that the debt contracting mechanism between companies and banks has developed since such a reform. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

The aim of this paper is to analyze to what extent business growth opportunities influence decisions on bank debt. This objective is addressed by considering both the arguments of the positive agency theory and the institutional characteristics of the Chilean financial system. An empirical analysis considers the GMM system estimator applied to panel data of quoted Chilean firms for the period 1997 to 2008. The main advantage of this methodology is that it overcomes the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The main finding supports the hypothesis of the existence of a non-monotonic U-shaped relationship between growth opportunities and the level of bank debt. The initial negative relationship is explained by the costs associated with underinvestment problems, whilst the increasing part which reflects the positive relationship among growth opportunities and bank debt is based on the arguments of overinvestment costs. This result is robust to a number of alternative measures of growth opportunities. (c) 2012 de Cladea.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether managerial ownership-induced income smoothing accentuates or attenuates an information asymmetry problem. Standard agency theory suggests that managerial ownership may play a significant role in alleviating agency problems between managers and external shareholders that can arise from information asymmetry. According to this view, managerial ownership-induced income smoothing could convey managerial private information and could, therefore, be considered as informative. However, managerial ownership could also entrench managers with absolute control of firms, and encourage them to engage in earnings manipulation, including earnings smoothing, in order to hide private benefits of control. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses two smoothing measures, and separate total smoothing into its innate and discretionary components. The former is determined by firm fundamentals, whereas discretionary smoothing allows managers the flexibility to use it for either informative or opportunistic reasons. The paper then regresses information asymmetry, as proxied by scaled bid-ask-spreads, on the interaction between managerial ownership and both these smoothing components. Findings - The paper documents that managerial ownership-induced discretionary smoothing has a positive effect on bid-ask spreads. This result seems to support the entrenchment view of managerial ownership. Practical implications - This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the effectiveness of the managerial ownership aspect of corporate governance in New Zealand. Originality/value - This paper uses agency theory to provide a comparative assessment of the efficient versus the entrenchment hypotheses with respect to managerial ownership.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess whether ownership concentration, leverage and demand for equity financing is associated with internal corporate governance quality. The paper focuses on dimensions of governance quality that are related to financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors measure internal governance quality by an indicator variable that takes on higher values depending on whether a company has an audit committee, has a sufficient number of audit committee meetings during the year, has financial expertise on the audit committee, has an internal auditing function, a risk management function, a code of conduct and whistle blower provisions in the code of conduct. The sample consists of 91 Swedish listed companies of which 39 companies had to follow the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. The development of hypotheses is based on agency theory. Ordered logistic regressions are used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The paper finds a strong negative association between leverage and the internal governance quality score for companies that do not have to follow the Corporate Governance Code. The paper also finds a positive association between the governance quality score and dispersed ownership among companies that have to follow the code. Research limitations/implications - The negative association between leverage and governance quality is opposite to the typical agency theory prediction. A number of other studies have also documented negative or insignificant associations with leverage in related settings. The research suggests there is a demand to develop theories related to leverage and the implementation of governance characteristics beyond the typical agency theory based predictions. Practical implications - The results raise the question whether lenders more actively directly or indirectly should influence the governance quality of borrowers. Originality/value - Based on the conjecture that governance quality increases with the number of governance elements, the paper studies a governance score that is built up by several elements of good corporate governance. Furthermore, the authors study a setting dominated by voluntary choices of governance quality, which makes it possible to study supply effects. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine the corporate governance environment of smaller listed Australian firms to investigate the factors that determine how firms respond to recommendations contained in corporate governance codes. We group corporate governance recommendations into three distinct categories and argue that differences in adoption costs between categories, together with firm specific factors, determine a firm's decision to conform with the recommendation or to explain the reasons for non-conformance. Analysis of the conformance by smaller firms with governance recommendations highlights substantial differences in adoption rates between categories of recommendations. Our results also reveal that the cost of adopting specific recommendations, together with profitability, external audit quality, and ownership dispersion, jointly explain a firm's decision to 'comply or explain'. This study provides insights for policy makers and regulators regarding the appropriateness of corporate governance recommendations for smaller firms.

We estimate the short-run stock price response to unanticipated capital expenditures. We use association study methodology to avoid the self-selection bias in event studies and to facilitate construction of a large sample of firm-years likely to exhibit agency problems. We find that the average price response to routine capital expenditures is negative, and that commonly used agency cost measures explain fully the negative response. Subsample results support the conclusion that the market is skeptical of cash flow financed spending by low-q firms and even capital spending by high-q firms when the firm is large and q is only marginally high.

This article investigates the effects of privatization under Brazil's National Privatization Program (PND) during the 1990s on companies' capital structure. Our model suggests that privatized firms increased their market leverage by 10-14% on average relative to the level before privatization. The effect of privatization on book leverage level was 8-12% on average. These results indicate a positive effect of the privatization process on the levels of leverage of privatized firms, as predicted by signalling and agency theories.

Agency theory is used to explain many firm marketing activities. However, its assumptions are founded in characteristics of North American actors, particularly in the United States. As such, it is not surprising that work employing agency theory in other national contexts often fails to find support. Taking a comparative institutional approach, this article theorizes how the human assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory differ across countries by utilizing the three pillars (i.e., regulative, normative, and cognitive) set forth by institutional theory. In particular, attenuations of the human assumptions of self-interest, risk-aversion, and bounded rationality of agents are theorized to influence goal alignment, risk sharing, and information processing in the agency relationship and in turn, effect prescriptions of governance and contracting given by the traditional agency model. A series of research propositions are developed to provide insight into the contractual implications in the principal-agent relationship across different institutional contexts. The theoretical attenuations presented provide guidance for marketing academics and practitioners engaged in cross-national agency relationships. (c) 2012, Academy of Marketing Science.

This paper investigates the link between board structure and firm performance. The impact of conglomerate diversification on the relationship between board effectiveness and firm performance is also examined. Boards of director effectiveness, including board composition, board size, institutional ownership, and aspects of board leadership including CEO duality are addressed in the Tunisian context. The study employs a dynamic model to study twenty-eight non-banking companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange over the period 1997-2003. The empirical results are mixed and are consistent with previous studies particularly in the Tunisian context. Evidence was found that conglomerate diversification is negative and statistically significant to both board effectiveness and firm performance, which increases the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders and leads to the expropriation of minority shareholders rights. These findings have several implications for understanding the opportunistic behavior of managers. (c) 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The literature on managers' compensation points out several factors specific to firms and to the determinants of stock options awards. At the empirical level, most studies focused on market-oriented governance mechanisms [studies on the US context (Yermack, 1995; Tzioumis, 2008)] or network-oriented systems [studies on the Japanese context (Uchida, 2006)]. We attempt to determine the factors behind stock options awards in a country characterised by a mixed governance system (market- and network-oriented) which is France. We conducted our study on a sample of 152 firms listed on the French stock market (the SBF250 index) during the 2002-2009 period. The results supported the hypothesis that the factors behind managers' stock option compensation are firm size, growth opportunities, manager's age, dividend distribution and ownership concentration.

This study seeks to empirically examine the effect of ownership concentration on mitigating free cash flow agency problem in New Zealand. Following Jensen's (1986) argument that managers have incentives to misuse free cash flows, this study tests whether concentrated ownership structure helps alleviate such a problem or exacerbates it. A natural consequence of this agency problem will be overinvestment and other operational inefficiencies which are likely to have a detrimental impact on firms' future performance. The second objective of this paper is to examine the association between FCFAP conditional on ownership concentration on future firm performance. We measure free cash flow agency problem as the product of positive free cash flows and growth opportunities proxied by Tobin's Q and find that financial institution-controlled ownership structure in New Zealand is positively associated with free cash flow agency problem. We also document that free cash flow agency problem conditional on ownership concentration negatively affects future firm performance. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the degree of control of large shareholders on the relation between dividend payout and firm value creation. From the perspective of agency theory, dividend payout is highly appreciated for firms subject to highly agency problems. Using a sample of 275 firm-years listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange over the period 1998-2007, our results show that contrary to agency theory predictions, dividend payout of Tunisian firms contributes more to value creation when the firm has low agency conflicts. We find a positive and highly coefficient for the payouts of firms with shared control and with majority financial institution control. These results may be interpreted through the trust assigned by Tunisian investors to firms that have low agency problems. Our results also indicate a strong positive relationship between the return on assets, the level of debt and firm value. Finally, we document a negative relationship between the financial business sector and firm value. (c) 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of both firm-specific and external factors on the risk taking of European insurance companies. The extent of risk taking is quantified through variations in stock prices and these are explained by firm-specific and external factors that proxy the environment in which the insurers are active. Using a two-way panel regression analysis with fixed and random effects, our empirical study covers hand-collected data on 35 German and UK insurance companies for the period 1997 to 2010. We find that differences in company size, capital structure, liquidity, and economic development affect variations in stock prices. The analysis also highlights differences between the market-based UK corporate governance system and the control-based regime implemented in Germany, with the UK exhibiting a higher level of risk, compensation, and board independence. We also document increases in the volatility of insurance stock returns during the financial crisis. (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to measure the degree of the managerial entrenchment and to study its impact on the performance of the firm. The model of the entrenchment's degree is based on both the personal characteristics of the manager and on the ownership structure of the firm. According to our empirical studies carried on 815 firms during the period 2001-2004, the entrenchment's degree depends significantly on the age and on the tenure of the manager as well as on the relative power of the managerial ownership. Moreover, the relationship between the managerial entrenchment and the performance of the firm is not linear. It takes the form of a harmful entrenchment then of a beneficial one as the entrenchment's degree increases. This result shows that the managerial entrenchment is not always harmful to the shareholders' wealth. Empirically, by exceeding a certain critical level (0.81), the managerial entrenchment becomes beneficial to the shareholders. (c) 2014 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This article contrasts three views or paradigms of the business enterprise and of critical management issues regarding governance. The first two are the agency and contracting paradigms. These dominate most discussion of the governance of corporate activities. The third is the capabilities perspective, which is starting to gain attention in the literature. Agency theory highlights how incentives should be crafted and governance activities focused to bring about better performance for shareholders when ownership and control are separated. Transaction cost economics highlights, as does agency theory, the importance of opportunism. But it adds asset specificity considerations that are also relevant to organizational design choices, including governance mechanisms. The capabilities perspective focuses less on managing opportunism and more on harnessing and managing opportunity. In that sense, it is closer to the essence of capitalism.

This study investigates the effect of government ownership structure, business risk and financial leverage among other variables (size, age and growth) on a company's performance in a panel data, using 191 companies from five GCC countries (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait), during the period 1999- 2006. Our results indicate that government ownership affects the performance and value of GCC firms. Government ownership positively and significantly affects firm's performance ROA. The insignificance of a firm's leverage (LEV) indicates that the firm's performance is irrelevant to its capital structure, and that supports Modigliani and Miller (M&M) (1958) argument. Our finding is that business risk (BETA) significantly and positively affects firm's performance ROE and supports the classic risk trade-off arguments. Furthermore, age was found to have a positive and significant impact on firm's performance ROA and ROE. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of large shareholdings from the agency problem perspective of overinvestment, and retest the role of board independence in the context of concentrated ownership. Using a fiveyear panel data of Chinese nonfinancial listed companies between 2001 and 2005, the paper estimates both a fixedeffects model and a randomeffects model. The paper finds evidence of a significant nonmonotonic relationship between large shareholdings and firm level overinvestment. It also finds that stateowned firms and firms with more independent directors experience lower level of overinvestment. However, firms with more frequent meetings experience a higher level of overinvestment. The paper's findings indicate that concentrated ownership is not always a bad thing. The crux of the matter is how to induce large shareholders' incentive to monitor managers' opportunistic behaviors and restrict their motivation to expropriate minority shareholders. In the context of concentrated ownership, the key to improve corporate governance is to strengthen board independence. The paper provides useful information on nonmonotonic governance effects of large shareholdings in Chinese listed companies and overinvestment. (c) 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The purpose of this article is to review and systematize prior work on technological innovation in family firms and to open up an agenda to guide future research into this promising area. The study shows that family involvement has direct effects on innovation inputs (e.g., R&D expenditures), activities (e.g., leadership in new product development projects), and outputs (e.g., number of new products), as well as moderating effects on the relationships between these steps of technological innovation. The article uses theories applied in family business research (e.g., agency theory) to discuss opportunities for extending technological innovation frameworks by considering family involvement.

There has been much debate concerning the performance of family firms and the drivers of their performance. Some scholars have argued that family management is to blame when family firms go wrong; others claim that family management removes costly agency problems and encourages stewardship. Our thesis is that these disagreements can only be resolved by distinguishing among different types of family firms. We argue that family CEOs will outperform in smaller firms with more concentrated ownership and underperform in larger firms with more dispersed ownership; they will do neither where firms are smaller and ownership is more dispersed or firms are larger and ownership is more concentrated.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms' entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm's level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

In this study we investigate how the dispersion of family ownership among family members affects the performance of small-to-medium-size family firms. Based on agency theory and prior research on family firms, we develop arguments pointing to the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the degree of family ownership dispersion and firm performance. We also consider the involvement of family members in top management as a moderating factor of this relationship. The empirical analyses conducted on 494 small-to-medium size private family firms in Italy support our hypotheses and offer further evidence about curvilinear relationships between family ownership and family involvement in management, and performance. Overall, our study represents a theoretical synthesis and extension of the effects of family involvement on the performance of small-to-medium size private firms. It adds empirical evidence to this stream of research, offers new insights into the sources of heterogeneity among the population of family firms, and paves the way for future investigations on other organizational outcomes, especially firm growth, in family firms.

We investigate the relationship between firm governance and the board's position in the social network of directors. Using a sample of 133 German firms over the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, we find that firms with intensely connected supervisory boards are (1) associated with lower firm performance, and (2) pay their executives significantly more. We interpret these results as evidence of poor monitoring in firms with directors who are more embedded in the social network. In both cases, simple measures for busy directors that were used by other studies in the past fail to show any significant pattern. The findings suggest that the quality and structural position of additional board seats may play a bigger role than simply the number of board appointments. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Direct transfer (Type I tunneling) means that the controlling shareholders transfer resources from the firm for their own benefit. This study aims to investigate the impact of internal and external governance mechanisms from the perspective of principal-principal (P-P) conflicts on Type I tunneling. Research Findings/Insights: Using hand-collected data comprising 117 Chinese listed companies with 540 firm-year observations during 2001-2005, the results show that state ownership and the number of board of directors' meetings are positively correlated with Type I tunneling, whereas the number of independent directors reveals a negative association. Other internal governance mechanisms including foreign ownership, the size of the board of directors, supervisory board size, number of professional supervisors, and the number of supervisory board meetings were found to have no impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Several implications can be drawn. First, this study has modeled tunneling using a well-accepted theoretical perspective - agency theory of P-P conflicts. But the results show that agency theory does not appropriately explain tunneling behavior in China and so institutional theory is suggested as an alternative theoretical perspective for future research. Second, corporate governance reforms relating to supervisory boards have not been sufficient to ensure that they properly fulfill their role of oversight. Rather, such supervisory boards are perhaps playing more of a "rubber stamp" role. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study recommends prescribing the legal responsibilities and obligations for two-tier boards in the Chinese context, allowing them to undertake their duties diligently.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This study examines relations between the overall level of effective information technology (IT) governance and five commonly advocated individual mechanisms of IT governance. It extends the examination of individual IT governance mechanisms to include a wider number of mechanisms, justifies the mechanisms investigated via agency theory, seeks to relate these mechanisms specifically to a perceived overall level of effective IT governance in organizations, and attempts to mitigate the problems of limited generalizability and selection bias by employing a survey and generalized sampling research methodology. The results from a survey of professional auditors reveal significant positive relations between the overall level of effective IT governance and three IT governance mechanisms: IT steering committees, senior management involvement in IT, and corporate performance measurement systems. Ex-post sensitivity analyses reveal that the primary findings are qualitatively similar across internal auditors and external auditors, as well as information systems auditors (IS) and non-IS auditors.

This study seeks to understand the underlying relationship between managerial ownership and corporate social performance in privately owned Chinese firms. Agency theory predicts that corporate expenditure on social practices is merely a managerial expropriation in an ordinary business setting. However, the business context of natural disasters in China has been characterized by stakeholder pressure on corporate responsibility. We propose that in our context of study, corporate social performance constitutes an investment and managers who own significant parts of the company are more likely to promote corporate philanthropic actions. Using a hand-collected database that includes firm-level data on corporate contributions after the Sichuan Earthquake on 12 May 2008, we find that higher managerial ownership is associated with a significantly higher probability of donation and charity. Furthermore, we find that corporate board size and political ties with the government moderate this relationship. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance on auditor quality choice by IPO companies in an emerging market setting. It seeks to identify whether efficiency or opportunism is the driving force behind the choice of auditors in Bangladeshi firms going public. We try to see whether ownership concentration in the hands of a owner-CEO wins over foreign shareholders in the contest of ensuring financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach - Multivariate analysis has been carried out on all IPOs made during 1990 to 2005 whose financial statements were available. Logistic regression tool has been used to identify client's corporate governance attributes affect their choice of auditors. In total, three corporate governance attributes - CEO-Chair duality, retained ownership, and foreign equity participation - were used to test the impact of ownership structure on auditor choice. Findings - Our findings from logistic regression suggest that CEO-Chair duality and the degree of foreign equity participation are significant determinants of auditor choice while proportion of board ownership is not. In addition, issuer size and whether the issuer is a green field operation also influence auditor choice while the length of a firm's operating history does not seem to matter. The findings support agency theory prediction that (at least one category of) principals (foreign shareholders in this case), are likely to trade-off higher monitoring costs (of hiring a higher quality auditor) with agency costs arising from asymmetric information, primarily borne by absentee owners. Originality/value - The work is based on empirical data directly from company financial statements. It uses audited financial statements and makes objective analysis of auditor choice dynamics in a frontier market that demonstrated significant growth of IPO activity in recent years.

Purpose: Based on the agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to theoretically argue and empirically investigate how ownership structure impacts the capital structure of the listed mid-cap companies in India and whether the capital structure as exogenous variable has a role in determining ownership structure as well. Design/methodology/approach: Simultaneity between capital structure and ownership structure is checked through Hausman specification test on endogeneity. Fixed effect panel regression model is used to analyze five years of data (2005-2009) on the sample units, to find the relation between leverage and ownership structure after controlling for profitability, risk, tangibility, growth and size. Findings: Empirical results on Indian firms suggest that the ownership structure does impact capital structure but not the vice versa. Consistent with theoretical prediction empirical results reveal that the leverage is positively related to concentrated shareholding and has a negative relation with diffuseness of shareholding after controlling for profitability, risk, tangibility, growth and size. The findings are consistent with "managerial entrenchment hypothesis" and "pecking order theory" of capital structure. Practical implications: The findings of the paper will enable the practitioners and analysts to understand as to why, in the bank and financial institution-dominated debt financing system in India, leverage is closely associated with concentrated ownership pattern and why retained earning is a preferred vehicle of financing for the firms with diffused shareholding. Originality/value: The results of the study enrich the literature on capital structure, agency cost and corporate governance issues in several ways. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the impact of family control on French acquirers' performance.We consider a sample of 239 acquisitions undertaken by French listed companies between January 1997 and December 2006. Comparing both, short-termand long-termperformance,we find that family-controlled firms outperformnon-family firms. We find that the relationship depends on the control level. The higher operating performance of family firms is statistically significant for an intermediate level of control. Around the announcement date, family firms with a high level of control outperform non-family firms. Using the calendar time approach, we find that long-term stock performance of family firms is positive and statistically significant. Robustness tests showthat our findings seem to not be driven by the endogeneity problem. Finally, we find that family wedge, due to the use of the pyramidal structure and the double voting rules, has no statistical significant effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This review article seeks to celebrate the deconstruction of the mythology of shareholder value inspired by Lynn Stout, and to dismantle the hegemony of agency theory, which originated the concepts of shareholder value and shareholder primacy. In order to offer a contextualized, historical critique of the intellectual forces that created agency theory and the concept of shareholder value, the analysis presents a broad consideration of the financialization of the Anglo-American corporation in the later decades of the twentieth century. It was in this period that the Anglo-American corporation was crudely transformed from being a wealth-creating vehicle for the wider community of stakeholders and whole economy, into a bundle of assets with the sole purpose of benefiting shareholder interests. This analysis traces some of the historical critique of corporate purpose, and the wider implications of the critique for corporate activity. The article goes on to analyse the interpretations of corporate purpose emerging in modern company law reform. Finally, the article considers the implications of the growing international corporate social responsibility movement for directors' duties, which is arguably in contradiction to many of the fundamental beliefs of shareholder value, and recasts the direction of corporations towards more responsible and sustainable value creation.

This article addresses value creation by corporate centres of multi-business firms through vertical intervention in single business units. Drawing on parenting literature, agency theory, and the resource-based view, we develop a model comprising an interlinked set of hypotheses on value creation. These take into account the administrative as well as the entrepreneurial value creation function of a corporate centre. The model depicts value creation from the perspective of individual businesses in an unrelated-diversified portfolio and is tested in a unique and unconventional research setting. Regarding the necessity to add value to businesses, we consider private equity firms to have a similar role as the centre of an unrelated diversified multi-business firm, and analyse survey data on 267 portfolio companies using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results show that corporate centres can create value through vertical intervention in single business units, by reducing agency costs through governance mechanisms as part of their administrative function and, interestingly, by also providing businesses access to strategic resources during the course of their entrepreneurial function. In particular, the provision of intangible resources, i.e., the knowledge and networks of the corporate centre, shows to have a value creating effect on business units. Not related to the units' performance is a corporate centre's attempt to create value using horizontal synergy by fostering the cooperation of a business unit with other units. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The main purpose of the present research is to study the relationship between ownership concentration and the type of ownership, i.e. state, firm (legal persons), individual, family, institutional - on the value of the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Design/methodology/approach: The study applies panel data regression analysis to a sample of companies listed in TSE during the period 2005-2009. Two-stage least-squares analysis is conducted. Findings: The paper finds that ownership concentration is positively related to ROE, and that ownership concentration is negatively related to ROA. Moreover, state, family, and individual ownership are negatively related to performance, and firm (legal person) and institutional ownership are positively related to performance. The paper also finds that higher firm profitability requires a more diffused ownership structure. Research limitations/implications: The results of the present research support agency theory and efficient monitoring hypothesis. The results strongly suggest the failure of state ownership in increasing companies' value and underline the importance of accelerating privatization in Iran. Practical implications: To improve the performance and consequently the value of companies, the process of privatization in Iran must be accelerated and public ownership must be transferred to the private sector. Further, investors must pay special attention to the type of ownership and ownership concentration of companies when deciding to buy their shares. Originality/value: The study builds on prior research in several ways. First, the paper offers new insights into the relationship between corporate governance and economic performance by using data from Iranians listed firms, this new evidence from an emerging market enhances the understanding of corporate governance in Asian countries. Second, the study focuses on five dimensions: ownership concentration, state, firm, individual, family, and institutional ownership which allow one to get a more accurate picture of the ownership structure-firm value relationship.

This paper reconsiders the issue of share price reactions to dividend announcements. We use the difference between the actual dividend and the analyst consensus forecast as obtained from I/B/E/S as a proxy for the surprise in the dividend announcement. Using data from Germany, we find significant share price reactions after dividend announcements. We use panel methods to analyze the determinants of the share price reactions and find evidence in favour of the cash flow signaling hypothesis and dividend clientele effects. We further find that the price reaction to dividend surprises is related to the ownership structure of the firm. The results do not support the free cash flow hypothesis. An additional result of our analysis is that dividend changes are not an appropriate measure to capture the information content of dividend announcements. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Family control in family firms can extend beyond the direct involvement of family members, but identifying these mechanisms is difficult in most markets. We utilize unique disclosures made by Taiwanese firms to examine the role played by family representatives in listed family firms. Family representatives are non-family members that represent the controlling family's indirect shareholdings in the firm. We examine whether family representatives are used in the same manner as family members and whether they provide net benefits or costs to shareholders. Research Findings/Insights: In our sample of listed family firms, we find that omitting family representatives understates the influence of controlling families by 46 percent. We show that family representatives are associated with net costs to shareholders, but to a lesser extent than family members. We also find that controlling families use family members and family representatives differently. Family members are more involved in older family firms and in firms founded by the family. Family representatives are more involved in acquired and second generation family firms and in larger firms with more fixed assets. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the use of family representatives and show that family representatives are being used by controlling families to extend their influence within their firms, increasing agency costs to minority shareholders. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For policymakers, our analysis shows that disclosure of family member and representative relationships within firms is important and value-relevant to investors. Furthermore, our results suggest that firm performance could be improved by limiting the involvement of family members and family representatives in family firms. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how managerial shareholding affects audit pricing for listed companies in Hong Kong. Based on agency theory, we examine the relationship between managerial shareholding and audit fees, from the perspectives of the alignment effect and the entrenchment effect. We posit a non-linear relationship, which is tested by grouping sample firms into three levels of managerial shareholding: low, intermediate, and high regions of management ownership. The empirical results reveal that the association of managerial ownership with audit fees is non-linear: managerial shareholding is significantly and negatively associated with audit fees in the low and high regions of managerial ownership, whereas the association is significantly positive in the intermediate region. These correlations are further confirmed by the results of curvilinear regression analysis. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and ownership structure on voluntary disclosure practices of Malaysian listed firms. The extent of voluntary disclosure is determined for a matched-sample of 100 listed firms in three different disclosure regimes during 1996, 2001 and 2006. The findings suggest that regulatory reforms over the 1996 to 2006 period resulted in enhanced corporate transparency and accountability as reflected in more extensive voluntary disclosures. We provide empirical evidence that the extent of voluntary disclosures is significantly associated with the strength of corporate governance structure in 2001 and 2006 and with ownership structure in 1996, 2001 and 1996. The findings of this study are of use to regulators in terms of guiding policy development regarding corporate transparency of publicly listed firms. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Publicly traded Chinese firms recently reformed their ownership structures by converting non-tradable shares, which constituted two-thirds of shares outstanding and were held largely by the state, into shares that could trade on domestic exchanges. To facilitate this reform, tradable shareholders were compensated with stock grants from non-tradable shareholders. Our analysis focuses on the level of compensation, the compensation ratio, the ratio of new tradable shares granted to tradable shares outstanding before the reform. Contrary to the predictions of asset-pricing models, most firms set the compensation ratio around 0.3. We explain this surprising convergence using institutional theory. In doing so, we analyze the power and interests of all relevant actors - not just owners, but also state regulators, executives, and other agents - and draw on insights from resource-dependence and agency theories. We find strong evidence of coercive and mimetic isomorphism, but no evidence of normative isomorphism. Because our dependent variable is continuous (a ratio), we are able to show that the mimetic effects we observe cannot be attributed to coercion or norms. Thus, we not only explain an empirical puzzle, we also advance institutional analysis of isomorphism by clearly distinguishing three isomorphic forces that have been conflated in much previous research.

The existing literature documents that the financial reporting quality is higher when firms have effective audit committees. However, recent studies find that audit committees are not effective in family firms where agency conflicts arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. Extending the previous findings, this study investigates the effectiveness of audit committees in firms with similar agency conflicts when one owner obtains effective control of the firm. Compared to firms with a low level of block ownership, high-blockholder firms face less agency problems due to the separation of ownership and management, but more severe agency problems between controlling (blockholders) and non-controlling shareholders. Using a unique hand-collected sample, using the largest 350 UK firms for three years from 2005 to 2007, and shows that firms with effective audit committees have less earnings management. This study also documents that the monitoring effectiveness of audit committees is moderated in firms with high blockholder ownership. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The tenets of agency theory suggest that: 1) managers may pursue investment strategies that are at odds with shareholder value, and 2) effective governance mechanisms can improve the quality of managerial decision-making and enhance the outcomes of corporate investment. Accordingly, using an agency theory lens, we hypothesize that the financial outcomes of global diversification are contingent on the quality of the multinational firm's corporate governance: high (poor) quality corporate governance is associated with positive (negative) financial consequences attributable to global diversification. Using a sample of 5985 firm-year observations over the period 2002 through 2006, we find support for our hypothesis. The results are robust to using three different measures of global diversification, three different measures of financial outcomes (one accounting-based and two market-based measures), and two econometric methods to control for the endogeneity of the diversification decision.

This paper examines the connection between shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, we examine the effect of shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. We find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) is positively related to market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by CEOs and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by CFOs has any significant effect on market valuation. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive outside) directors is positively related to market valuation. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

It has been discussed that whether family ownership perform better or less perform than non-family ownership that might create or destroy agency costs among the managers and shareholders. This paper is to investigate the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks in Malaysia from year 2001 to 2010. This study compares the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks that operate under central bank of Malaysia, (BNM) and are listed on Bursa Malaysia. Multiple regression technique was performed to investigate the relationship between independent variable (ownership structure) and dependent variables (Tobin's Q, ROA and ROE). Findings indicate that Tobin's Q is the best fit as the dependent variable for the regression model. It shows the highest F statistics value, which is 6.247 as compared to ROA and ROE for full sample. Meanwhile, the adjusted R squared of Tobin's Q indicates similar higher value as well that is 0.150 between the dependent variables. Board composition and board size indicate strong influence on the performance of family-owned banks. Smaller board size on the board can help the bank to achieve better performance in term of Tobin's Q and ROE. In contrast, board composition attains better performance in term of ROA rather than Tobin's Q and ROE. This study can provide useful insights of the governance mechanism that could influence the firm performance.

This paper examines the impact of ownership structure and concentration on firm performance in Sri Lanka, an emerging market in Asia. The study estimates a series of regressions using pooled data for a sample of Sri Lankan-listed firms to investigate the impact of ownership concentration and structure on firm performance based on agency theory framework, using both accounting and market-based performance indicators. The results of the study provide evidence for a strong positive relationship between ownership concentration and accounting performance measures. This suggests that a greater concentration of ownership leads to better performance. However, we found no significant impact using market-based performance measures, which suggests the existence of numerous market inefficiencies and anomalies. Furthermore, the findings of the study show that ownership structure does not have a significant distinguishable effect on performance.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

Purpose - Building on new venture internationalization, agency, and signaling theories, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the level of firm internationalization and initial public offering (IPO) performance. Further, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the moderating role of firm ownership structure on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - The data set for this study is composed of 298 firms that made IPOs in years 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2002 in the US stock exchanges. The study utilizes hierarchical ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses to test its hypotheses. The model developed in this study identified IPO firm ownership structure as the moderator variable, IPO firm internationalization as the predictor variable, and underpricing as the criterion variable. This paper utilized robust regression modeling analyses available in Stata to analyze the data and test their hypotheses. Findings - Results based on data collected from298 IPOfirmssuggest that firminternationalization has a positive impact on IPO underpricing. Results also report that the relationship between firm internationalization and IPO underpricing is moderated by CEO and blockholder ownership, with the relationship being stronger in IPO firms with higher levels of CEO and blockholder ownership. Originality/value - The current paper examines the impact of an IPO firm's internationalization prior to its going public on the subsequent performance of the IPO. In doing so, this paper seeks to help in resolving some of the apparent theoretical and empirical contradictions identified in literature. In addition, the introduction of IPO ownership structure as a moderator variable in the relationship between IPO firm internationalization and performance extends the applicability of agency theory to IPO firms and ensures a multi-theoretic, finer-grained conceptualization of this relationship.

Corporate governance research based on agency theory has been criticized for being "under-contextualized," and for evaluating various governance practices independently. To address both criticisms, we take a configurational approach and show how firm-level governance practices interact with informational asymmetries associated with a firm's industry. By examining foreign Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) that have chosen to list on London stock exchanges, we demonstrate that an assessment of the firm-level corporate governance configurations is incomplete without taking into account the firm's industry affiliation. Our use of fs/QCA underscores the possibilities configurational approaches have in advancing theories of corporate governance. (c) Copyright 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article tests the separation of ownership and control in South African-listed companies that leads to the divergence of interest between shareholders and directors. Where listed companies are owned by so many shareholders that their diffused shareholding results in negligible control over the directors who manage the assets of the company, it is likely that the directors will manage and direct the company to maximise their self-interest to the detriment of the interest of the shareholders. The separation of ownership and control and the maximisation of self-interest are central themes in the agency theory. Researching their validity in a South African context where the market is less liquid and the stock exchange is significantly smaller can add a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on corporate governance in the country. The article analyses 186 listed South African companies using data extracted over four years to test whether there is separation of ownership and control and whether such separation leads to the maximisation of self-interest. Data were extracted for the years 2005 and 2006, using the shareholding in 2006 to determine control, and for the years 2009 and 2010, using the shareholding in 2010 to determine control. Directors' remuneration as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of directors' interest, and profit attributable to shareholders as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of shareholders' interest. These proxies were used to test the impact of control during the two controlling periods, namely 2006 and 2010. The article finds that the majority of listed companies in South Africa are controlled by a dominant shareholder. However, there are still a significant number of companies where the directors have de facto control. Contrary to the expectation that companies controlled by directors will aim to maximise directors' remuneration, or companies controlled by shareholders will aim to maximise profit attributable to shareholders, this article finds the opposite to be true. This is possibly an indication that the controlling parties might consider factors other than their direct financial self-interest, or that there is an inherent cost associated with control.

The study concentrates on audit committee characteristics and their influences on free cash flow. A panel of 120 firms from the trading and services industry from the year 2005 to 2008 is examined. The results show a significant and positive relationship between Audit Committee characteristics (size, independence, frequency of meetings) and free cash flows. These findings suggest that effective audit committee governance leads to availability of higher free cash flows. Our study draws upon the lack of understanding on the impact of audit committee characteristics on free cash flow along the two views; agency theory and pecking order/transaction cost theory and finds support for the later.

Fiduciary duties are an integral part of the corporate law landscape. The law and economics analysis of these duties, especially the duty of directors to maximize shareholder wealth, shows that these duties fill contractual gaps, saving on transaction costs. Although duties to shareholders are well settled, duties to other participants such as creditors or employees are heavily debated. In this paper, we use an agency theory framework to address the relative efficiency of a duty to creditors, a duty to refrain from wrongful trading, or contractual devices. Such an analysis makes clear what effect these rules have upon the behavior of shareholders and boards and whether these rules can efficiently address agency problems. The upshot of the analysis is that both types of rules protect creditors, but the same can be said of specific contractual solutions. It is therefore unclear if the rules mitigate costs above and beyond what could be achieved by contract. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the type of bankruptcy system matters as well. Creditor protection is best delivered via a board friendly bankruptcy system instead of with a creditor friendly system that includes a wrongful trading rule. The conclusion is that creditor duties, or wrongful trading rules, are superfluous, while private solutions are still inadequate to solve all the agency problems in a way that the proponents of both types of creditor protections aim for.

This paper investigates the effect of corporate governance on the cost of debt of Malaysian listed firms. This study draws on an agency theory from the perspectives of debt agency and traditional manager-shareholder agency costs to demonstrate that debt holders are sensitive to the quality of firm corporate governance. We utilise a comprehensive corporate governance index, covering 139 items in 6 broad categories, for evaluating corporate governance quality. Using the panel sample between 2003 and 2007, we argue that corporate governance lowers the cost of debt. Debt holders tend to be sensitive to corporate governance practices that affect the extent of expropriation tendencies of managers or shareholders, the validity of financial reports that they use in managing lending agreements and default risk. They view board structure and procedures, board compensation practices, shareholder rights and relations, accountability and audit and social and environmental activities as integral components of a good corporate governance framework.

The paper explains theoretical framework of how corruption hurts economic growth and reveals its application difficulties. Comparing views on corruption in terms of the problem of agency and the problem of rent-seeking we argue that corruption in general is the problem of legal setting and its enforcement and, if badly established, it does not promote economic growth. To verify the theoretical argument we present empirical Granger causality test to demonstrate that corruption precedes economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe. This means that legal setting and its enforcement rather allow for rent-seeking than promote economic growth. As a consequence we emphasize the necessity to focus on institutional framework to fight corruption and support economic growth.

Divestitures of property, plant and equipment (PPE) assets are a common form of corporate restructuring. However, divesting companies do not necessarily attain improved post-divestiture shareholder wealth. Studies show company characteristics and use of divestiture proceeds may influence divestiture outcomes. This paper attempts to determine these divesting company characteristics and use of proceeds associated with improved shareholder wealth based on the Agency Theory. A sample of Malaysian public-listed companies that divested assets within 2002-2005 is used. Logistic regression segregates these companies based on their industry-adjusted operational returns. Companies that improve post-divestiture operational performance require urgent pay out motives to divest. Companies with deteriorated post-divestiture performance divest without urgent pay out motive and tend to retain proceeds. This suggests agency problem of managerial discretion in asset divestitures. In asset selection, divestitures of larger and more inefficient assets were found associated with improved company performance. Malaysian companies prefer divesting assets related to their core businesses indicating a diversified company structure is more beneficial than a focused structure in developing countries.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present theoretical explanations for the failure of the largest dairy processing firm in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after only about one year of operation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper contains a case study on the establishment and failure of a new firm is presented. Data were collected through mass media reports and interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the dairy industry. The data were analyzed using neo-institutional theories, primarily agency theory. Findings - The core of the explanation is that the various categories of institutions were not aligned. For example, poor contract enforcement created insurmountable agency costs for all parties involved. Research limitations/implications - As this paper is based on a case study it is uncertain to which extent the finding can be generalized. Originality/value - Most case studies describe successes. This paper presents a case where the odds for success were poor, but the project was still initiated. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Focusing on the agency conflict between manager and shareholders and on the definitions of tunneling and propping, we delve into the related party transactions between a group and its management. Firstly, the paper examines actual and previous information to disclose for directors board remunerations (as for IAS, Consob and TUF). Such remunerations are based on a contract with legal and moral managers obligations to the companies of the group they run and to the stakeholder of such companies. For this reason, a balance between their remunerations and their performance is necessary to achieve preserving the interests of all the subjects involved in the companies' activities and maintaining the continuity of the group. Then, using regressions, we measure, in a sample of listed companies, if there is a significant and sustainable connection between particular remunerations of the highest paid members of the directors board and the economic group performance.

The purpose of the study is to estimate the magnitude of the votes and the excess of votes of the majority shareholders in Brazilian companies grounded by the agency theory. The ownership structure of Brazilian organizations differs from Anglo-Saxon ones that are the most common studied. Thereby, there is a gap of literature about the conflicts between managers, shareholders and sprayed ownership in the Brazilian context. In Brazil, which has concentrated ownership structure, duality of classes of shares and strong presence of major shareholders, the conflict occurs between majority and minority shareholders. Thus, from a separation of majority shareholder types of Ibovespa companies of the year of 2010, the research is characterized as descriptive and explanatory. The author utilizes bibliographic and documentary resources, using the data system Economatica of IAN's as well as Bovespa website for the analysis. The results showed that the capital structure of publicly traded companies is mainly concentrated on equity, occurring in several cases a considerable distance between the voting power and the power of the majority shareholders' cash flow. The results also suggest that publicly traded Brazilian companies have in most cases, a controlling shareholder - with more than 50% of the shares with voting rights of companies - and in many cases when there is not a controlling shareholder, there is a controlling bloc, formed by the three main majority shareholders of the companies.

Purpose - Agency theory suggests that if managers are not monitored, takeover negotiations may be contaminated by agency conflicts, which may weaken a firm's bargaining position. This paper argues that some blockholders are more effective monitors than others, and tests whether the negotiating power of a target or bidder is influenced by their respective blockholder composition. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper classifies target and bidder outside blockholders as either aggressive monitors or moderate monitors, and tests whether the degrees of monitoring effectiveness influence a firm's share of the total wealth created by the takeover (a proxy for bargaining power). Findings - This paper finds that firms that have the types of outside blockholders with a greater tendency to monitor managers elicit higher takeover gains. This suggests that negotiating power in takeovers is conditioned on the types of blockholders that monitor the target and bidder. The results support the premise that better monitoring leads to higher gains for shareholders in a takeover. In particular, the findings suggest that the greater the tendency of outside blockholders to monitor managers, the lower the level of takeover-related agency conflicts and the stronger a firm's relative bargaining power. Originality/value - These findings imply that agency conflicts on either side of a takeover bid may be reduced by better monitoring, but especially among bidders.

In the context of agency theory this study investigates the effect of corporate governance (CG) on Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) disclosure in a concentrated ownership environment, such as Italy. We hypothesize that IFR may be explained in term of increasing transparency in order to defend minority shareholder interest, so we predict, and find, a positive association between the extent of a firm's IFR and its CG and a negative association between IFR and ownership structure. CG is measured by ownership structure, using as a proxy the share held by the first three major shareholders and by managerial ownership, and by board composition, captured through the incidence of independent director (IND) and of a Non-Executive Chair (NEC). IFR is measured taking into consideration the content and format of information present in Investor Relations sections. (c) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

This study investigates the relationship between ownership structure and the cost of debt of 101 companies listed at Malaysian Bourse between 2003 and 2007. Ownership structure is defined along 4 dimensions: concentrated, family, insiders and government ownerships. Concentrated and government ownerships are found to have significant effects on firms' cost of debt. Debt issuers appear to regard concentrated ownership as an organisational attribute that better protects their interest. Government-owned firms suffer from high cost of debt; thus, appear to be less efficient than other firms. The result is robust with respect to controls for company size and performance, default and financial risks, economic growth, industry and time effects. (c) Zulkufly Ramly, 2013.

Although a concentrated ownership, usually by a single family, is most prevalent in Asian firms, agency costs between shareholders and managers persists to some degree unless there is 100% ownership of equity by management. In addition, with reforms spreading across Asia to promote more transparency of disclosures, more and more firms are adopting Western-style (US and UK) corporate governance measures. As a result, the difference between Asian and Western corporate governance is narrowing. The article reviews the issues of ownership structure, agency costs and liquidity, as they jointly affect firm value. The paper proposes a theoretical framework that illustrates the direct and indirect effects of ownership structure on firm value. (c) 2013 AIBE.

Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that increased managerial stock ownership will better align the interests of stockholders and investors, which should lead to better quality financial information and management forecasts. Corporate governance groups recommend ownership requirements for top management and over 400 firms in the S&P 500 have adopted mandatory plans over the last 15 years. The authors find evidence of more informative earnings when firms adopt a target ownership plan relative to the years with no ownership mandate. The authors find that management earnings forecast accuracy improves following the adoption of a target share ownership plan. Finally, the paper finds that the market recognizes the disclosure benefits of target ownership plans and reacts more strongly to surprising management earnings forecasts after adoption.

The behavioral agency model suggests family firms invest less in R&D than nonfamily firms to protect their socioemotional wealth. Studies support this contention but do not explain how family firms make R&D investments. We hypothesize that when performance exceeds aspirations, family firms manage socioemotional and economic objectives by making exploitative R&D investments that lead to more reliable and less risky sales levels. However, performance below aspirations leads to exploratory R&D investments that result in potentially higher but less reliable sales levels. Using a risk abatement model, our analyses of 847 firms over 10 years supports our hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders. Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.N (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

We examine changes in firms' dividend payouts following an exogenous shock to the information asymmetry problem between managers and investors. Agency theories predict a decrease in dividend payments to the extent that improved public information lowers managers' need to convey their commitment to avoid overinvestment via costly dividend payouts. Conversely, dividends could increase if minority investors are in a better position to extract cash dividends. We test these predictions by analyzing the dividend payment behavior of a global sample of firms around the mandatory adoption of IFRS and the initial enforcement of new insider trading laws. Both events serve as proxies for a general improvement of the information environment and, hence, the corporate governance structure in the economy. We find that, following the two events, firms are less likely to pay (increase) dividends, but more likely to cut (stop) such payments. The changes occur around the time of the informational shock, and only in countries and for firms subject to the regulatory change. They are more pronounced when the inherent agency issues or the informational shocks are stronger. We further find that the information content of dividends decreases after the events. The results highlight the importance of the agency costs of free cash flows (and changes therein) for shaping firms' payout policies.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the direct effect of family ownership on innovation in emerging markets by using data from Indian family-controlled publicly listed firms as its sample. In particular, we study (1) the direct effects of family ownership on innovation and (2) the influences of business group affiliation on these family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using an unbalanced panel of 395 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed Indian firms during the years 2001 and 2008, we found that the impact of family ownership on innovation productivity is positive (after controlling for possible endogeneity). We further emphasized the business group affiliation of family firms and distinguished between the innovation activities of group-affiliated and stand-alone family firms. We found that affiliating with top 50 business groups increases the innovation activities of these family firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Theoretically, we complement agency theory by incorporating both the institutional perspective and the external resourcing perspective to provide a more robust framework for examining the impact of family ownership on innovation in emerging markets. Methodologically, we adopted a more rigorous econometrics method by providing a panel analysis that used a system GMM estimator and addressed the endogeneity issue thoroughly, which represented a significant improvement over the shortcomings of the methodologies found in the existing literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that the Indian government should provide support for affiliating family firms with business groups while improving policies on information disclosures; it should also establish a proper corporate governance mechanism for private and public family business. The findings further suggest that a corporate governance code should encourage family firms to have an independent professional CEO. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We combine the value-creation and value-protection views of the board of directors to study the impact of board independence (BI) on the value of the firm at the time of its initial public offering (IPO). Research Findings/Insights: We conduct our analysis on a sample of 969 firms that went public in France, Germany, and Italy between 1995 and 2011. We show that BI is a critical factor in the valuation of IPO firms. Our results support both the value-creation and value-protection roles of the board of directors. The relative importance of the two roles of the board varies over time, with value-creation (value-protection) dominating in IPOs of young (mature) companies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our theoretical framework combines the agency and resource-dependence theories. The impact of BI on IPO valuation depends on the importance of the value-creation and value-protection roles played by the board. The change in the relative importance of the two roles determines a U-shaped relationship between BI and firm age. Corporate governance is particularly important for young and innovative firms (where the resource-dependence theory applies, and governance acts as a value-creation device), as well as for mature firms and for companies where ownership and control are separated (where the agency theory applies, and governance serves as a value-protection mechanism for minority shareholders). Practitioner/Policy Implications: We show that corporate governance is a significant factor affecting the valuation of an IPO company. The importance of BI varies substantially with the knowledge intensity of the industry, the separation between ownership and control, and the age of the listing company.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Family ownership has been recognized as an important determinant of corporate strategic choices; however, little research investigates the effects of family ownership and corporate governance on internationalization in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper utilizes agency theory and the resource-based view to analyze the relationships between family ownership, institutional ownership, and internationalization. Using a sample of Taiwanese SMEs, the finding of a positive family ownership-internationalization relationship suggests that family ownership may encourage internationalization. The interaction of family ownership and institutional ownership is positively related to internationalization, suggesting that SMEs with high family ownership are more likely to internationalize as institutional ownership increases.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

This study analyses the distribution of power among the several blockholders of a firm and the identity of those blockholders as a determinant of firm leverage. Using a sample of 694 firms from 12 Western European countries, our results support a negative relationship between ownership concentration in the hands of the main blockholder and firm leverage. Moreover, we detect that the presence of a second and third large shareholder (beyond the first blockholder) has a significant positive effect on the leverage ratio. In addition, the results show that contestability in family firms plays a more relevant role. Finally, we show that family firms do have significant impact on firm leverage level, and this impact varies depending on the legal framework and institutional environment. In our main sample the results show family firms negatively affect market leverage, supporting the theory that family firms are more averse to an increase in the debt level due to the risk of bankruptcy and financial distress as a result of having an under-diversified portfolio. In contrast, the opposite effect is found in the sample that excludes the United Kingdom. This last result cannot be explained by agency theory, given that family businesses are those that suffer less from Type I agency problems. This result suggests either some difficulty in financing their investments by issuing new equity or the need to use debt as a signal of the quality of its investments. Our results prove to be stable against a battery of robustness tests. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Agency theory suggests that independent outside board members may have an important monitoring function of the financial reporting process. As a result, boards with more independent directors have a tendency for increased monitoring and are therefore expected to insist on better earnings quality. This study examines whether board independence improves earnings quality by reducing earnings management in Portugal, a country with significantly different institutional and legal characteristics from the Anglo-Saxon countries. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential simultaneity problems between board independence and earnings quality, we find evidence that independent board members improve earnings quality by reducing earnings management for a sample of Portuguese listed firms. This result suggests that strengthening the independence of boards by appointing more independent board members is a positive step toward improving earnings quality.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a framework of connotative meanings afforded to the term "corporate governance". Design/methodology/approach - An examination of academic publications from 1985-2012 containing the term "corporate governance" was conducted. The articles are sorted into the theoretical constructs that influence the contemporary connotative meaning of corporate governance. Findings - That a combination of a weak definitional base coupled with strong motivational forces have aided the development of competing theoretical perspectives of the meaning of corporate governance. The dominant meaning is written from an agency theory perspective. Research limitations/implications - Theoretical analysis was restricted to articles found in academic journals published since 1985. Practical implications - This study provides a very useful analysis into the connotative meanings and theoretical bases used by academic writers in the study of corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper provides an updated and developed analysis to the theoretical dimensions that underpin the contemporary use of the term "corporate governance".

This theoretical study contributes to the debate in the field of strategic HRM on whether HRM systems should differ across employee groups within the firm. It explores differences in the efficacy of two HRM systems-high-involvement HR and internal labor market systems-across top management teams, middle managers, and professional employees. In addition, it examines factors that may prevent the adoption of effective HRM systems for these groups of knowledge workers. A model is proposed depicting how four job-level moderators influence the HRM-performance relationship and how these moderators apply to each of the three employee groups. Short-term performance pressures and favoritism in staffing are proposed as factors that may hinder the adoption of effective HRM systems. Finally, HRM systems for different employee groups are classified based on their gains potential and barriers to implementation, yielding four categories of strategic HRM activity metaphorically labeled low-hanging fruits, high-hanging fruits, peanuts, and barren land.

Microfinance Institutions provide financial services to poor people. Governance of these organizations is important so that they can operate efficiently and sustainably. This study analyzes the influence of stakeholders (donors, employees, customers, and creditors), on board structure (board size and CEO duality), and on organizational performance. We use a global data set of 379 microfinance institutions from 73 countries, collected from rating organizations. Supported by stakeholder theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory, we find stakeholders to be important and have various influences on microfinance institutions. We find donors to be associated with small boards, non-duality and better performance. Employees are associated with large boards, while customers are associated with duality and good financial performance. Creditors opt for duality and better social performance. Implications and areas for future research are discussed. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Institutional investors report that they prefer to invest in firms with greater board independence despite the fact that researchers have been unable to demonstrate a link between board independence and firm performance. We investigate whether differences among institutional investors affect these preferences. We find that trading strategies have some effect but that mutual funds - facing the strongest institutional pressures - have significantly stronger preferences for firms with greater board independence than do other types of institutional investors. This suggests that institutional investor preferences for independent boards are at least partially driven by institutional pressures rather than anticipated reductions in agency costs.

We examine how CEO power affects the extent of analyst coverage. CEO power can influence a CEO's incentives to disclose information. The amount of information disclosed by the CEO in turn influences the information environment, which affects financial analysts' incentives to follow the firm. Consistent with this notion, we show that firms with powerful CEOs are covered by fewer analysts. In addition, the evidence shows that firms with more powerful CEOs experience less information asymmetry. Powerful CEOs are well insulated and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in more transparency. The information provided to investors directly by the firm substitutes for the information in the analyst's report. As a result, the demand for analyst coverage is lower. Our results are important because they show that CEO power affects important corporate outcomes such as corporate transparency and analyst following. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Drawing from agency theory and socioemotional wealth considerations, we evaluate the extent post-IPO investment policy choices and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to nonfamily firms. Our results suggest that family firms underinvest in post-IPO liquidity, total investment spending, and R&D expenditures, relative to similar non-family firms. On the other hand, family firms overinvest in capital spending and underinvest in acquisition spending relative to nonfamily firms with dispersed but not concentrated ownership structures. Furthermore, while increases in R&D spending decrease shareholder value in family firms, the reverse is the case with acquisition spending. (c) The Author(s) 2014.

We examine leverage decisions in the context of national culture over the 1996-2010 period. Cultural characteristics can explain capital structure decisions from emerging-markets cross-listings. The results show that firms from countries with high Individualism and Indulgence employ more debt. Firms located in countries with high Power Distance, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientation are less leveraged. Additionally, Exchange-traded and capital-raising ADRs are more likely to be from countries with weaker corporate governance. Univariate tests show that capital-raising ADRs employ less debt relative to non-capital-raising ADRs, and notably, in the post-cross-listing period. Interestingly, the home country's cultural characteristics of capital-raising and exchange-traded ADRs exert less influence on their capital structure decisions. Our findings suggest that there is a value discount associated with increased firm leverage. Our insights have practical implications for portfolio managers attempting to enter emerging markets through the use of ADRs. Moreover, investors can evaluate the often neglected effect of cultural values into firm performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Findings: Results showed that a concave relationship exists between firm value and cash holdings, which confirmed that there is an optimal cash level that maximizes firm value. It was also found that deviations from the optimal level affect firm value negatively.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm value and cash holdings for the period 2003-2008. This study seeks to find if there are costs and benefits associated with holding too much or too little cash, then an optimal cash level exists where marginal benefits are offset by their costs. If this optimal point exists, then firm value will be maximized at that point and deviation from it will affect the firm value negatively.
Design/methodology/approach: Optimal cash level between firm value and cash holding is determined by investigating the concave relationship. If concave relationship exists then a residual term is included in the equation to see how deviations from the optimal level affect firm value. A two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator is used in estimating all results. GMM controls for unobserved firm heterogeneity and endogeneity problems.
Practical implications: The paper provides the existence of an optimal point of cash between costs and benefits wherein firm value is maximized. It has implications for firms' investment and financing decisions when there is limited access to external finance. At higher level of cash the study has implications for agency theory and governance practices.
Originality/value: The study establishes a conclusive relationship between firm value and cash holdings within the context of the Pakistani market. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The literature suggests that corporate diversification destroys firm value. This value destruction is usually considered to be a consequence of managers' pursuing diversification strategies to benefit themselves rather than to increase firm value. This paper provides evidence that casts doubt on this agency theory-based explanation for corporate diversification. Evidence based on insider trading suggests that managers themselves consider their diversification strategies to be value-increasing. Specifically, it is documented that corporate insiders (directors) purchase more of their firms' shares in the open market when corporate diversification is high. Moreover, insiders purchase more when the level of diversification discount is high, suggesting that they disagree with outside investors' undervaluation due to diversification. It is also found that the market reaction to insiders' purchases is positively related to corporate diversification. This result suggests that outsiders consider the amount of favourable information contained in insiders' purchases to increase with the extent of corporate diversification.

The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting Shariah governance mechanism in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). After reviewing existing theories that were used to explain the phenomenon of corporate governance, three most commonly used theories in the corporate governance and Shariah governance area namely agency theory, stewardship theory and stakeholder theory were used and integrated based on their interrelated concepts and their relationship with Shariah governance. The constructed theoretical framework includes five concepts, namely accountability, disclosure and transparency, competency, confidentiality and independency among the key functionaries in Shariah governance, which are perceived to be the principles of Shariah governance. This research is among the first attempts to build an integrated theoretical foundation for Shariah governance in IFIs and the developed theoretical framework can be used as the basis for interpretations and comparisons on the ideal versus practical situation of Shariah governance in IFIs.

Are there country-level differences in the use of pay-for-performance in executive compensation contracts? We investigate how formal country-level institutions affect pay-for-performance directly and if institutions have a moderating effect on the relation between ownership structure and pay-for-performance contracts. Based on agency theory arguments, we show that substitutionary and complementary relations are conceivable, for the direct and the moderating effect. We conduct an empirical analysis based on 2766 firm-year observations for the years 2005-2008. Our empirical results show that whereas strong shareholder protection substitutes pay-for-performance, disclosure requirements complement pay-for-performance. Additionally, strong shareholder protection complements the effect of concentrated ownership on pay-for-performance while disclosure requirements substitute effects of ownership concentration. Overall, our results provide evidence for the relevance of formal institutions as determinants of executive compensation contracts. Additionally, our results indicate the general complexity of integrating institutions and internal governance mechanisms. (c) 2014.

This study investigates which corporate governance and firm-specific characteristics lead firms to be prone to ex-post moral hazard by misallocating the funds that they specifically borrowed for financing their R&D activities. We study 106 firms that received a specially designed loan by a Turkish government to be invested only in R&D and technological innovations. We find that as the size of the loan increases firms are less prone to moral hazard. For family firms our results support the agency theory. For large shareholders, initially our results are aligned with the agency theory but after controlling for the loan size our results hold for the stewardship theory. We also find that as amount of the loans increases relative to size of firms, the performance of projects financed by these loans plummets. Finally, we show that moral hazard related to R&D and innovation activities varies across industries.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We combine agency and institutional theory to explain the division of equity shares between the foreign (majority) and local (minority) partners within foreign affiliates. We posit that once the decision to invest is made, the ownership structure is arranged so as to generate appropriate incentives to local partners, taking into account both the institutional environment and the firm-specific difficulty in monitoring. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large firm-level dataset for the period 2003-2011 from 16 Central and Eastern European countries and applying selectivity corrected estimates, we find that both weaker host country institutions and higher share of intangible assets in total assets in the firm imply higher minority equity share of local partners. The findings hold when controlling for host country effects and when the attributes of the institutional environment are instrumented. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The classic view is that weak institutions lead to concentrated ownership, yet it leaves the level of minority equity shares unexplained. Our contribution uses a firm-level perspective combined with national-level variation in the institutional environment, and applies agency theory to explain the minority local partner share in foreign affiliates. In particular, we posit that the information asymmetry and monitoring problem in firms are exacerbated by weak host country institutions, but also by the higher share of intangible assets in total assets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Assessing investment opportunities abroad, foreign firms need to pay attention not only to features directly related to corporate governance (e.g., bankruptcy codes) but also to the broad institutional environment. In weak institutional environments, foreign parent firms need to create strong incentives for local partners by offering them significant minority shares in equity. The same recommendation applies to firms with higher shares of intangible assets in total assets. (c) 2014 The Authors.

This study examines the determinants of board structure for Taiwanese firms by reviewing their board elections, held between 1991 and 2009. The paper emphasizes three factors: the distinction between insider-affiliated and non-insider-affiliated outside directors based on family relationships, governmental agency theory-based regulations, and the firm's choice between agency and stewardship governance philosophy. Evidence has shown that the proportion of non-insider-affiliated outsiders on the board is sensitive to changes in firm and CEO characteristics, and to changes in government regulations. Government regulations significantly shape corporate boards, encouraging a smaller size, more outside directors, and fewer insider-affiliated outside directors. For firms adopting agency and stewardship theories as governance arrangement, the determinants of board structure are diverse. The board structure of principal-steward firms is less susceptible to changes in firm characteristics but more susceptible to CEO influence, and more responsive to government regulations.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate whether hiring a high-quality auditor (i.e. industry specialist) depends on corporate governance indicators after controlling a different level of agency conflicts (ACs). Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses logistic regressions on 12,449 firm-year samples of Taiwanese public companies from 1998 to 2011 by grouping the samples into three categories (i.e. low, medium and high AC). Findings - The results show that the corporate governance indicators can explain the decision of auditor selection only in low and mediumACgroups, which suggest that there may be a complementary relationship between external (i.e. auditors) and internal governance when the ACs are mild. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the ongoing debate between the complementary and substitutable effects. When the internal ACs are controlled, the internal governance and auditor selection are complemented. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Nowadays, separation of ownership from control in business causes the inability of shareholders to have a full control over managerial actions. In this situation, agency theory assumes an opportunistic behavior, that is, individuals want to maximize their own expected interests and are resourceful in doing so. This opportunistic behavior leads to conflict of interest betweenmanagers and shareholders on the one hand, and majority andminority shareholders on the other. From the agency theory perspective, the aim of Corporate Governance (CG) is to mitigate these agency conflicts and direct the operations to achieve an appropriate performance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between CG characteristics and firm performance in Malaysian listed firms where divergence between cash flow and control rights is critical. Based on a randomly selected sample of 400 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia and applying the linear multiple regression, it is found that board independency and CEO duality have respectively positive and negative relationship with firm performance. In addition, audit quality has a significantly positive relationship with firm performance. The contribution of this study is to add a dummy interaction between audit quality and divergence between cash flow and control rights. It is found that high-quality audit firms can mitigate the agency problems in firms with divergence between cash flow and control rights. (c) 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insight whether disclosed compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) leads to higher valuation on the German stock market.Design/methodology/approach - Based on agency theory, stakeholder theory and institutional theory, the authors conduct a meta-analysis and evaluate the value relevance of the compliance with the GCGC.Findings - The research finds that compliance with the GCGC is mainly not a value-relevant factor for German companies listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.Research limitations/implications - The research considered is not fully comparable with regard to observation date, full integration of the GCGC rules and company selection/sample size. Future research is encouraged to research the valuation effects of compliance with the GCGC for a longer time horizon, the use of uniform performance measures and the integration of all GCGC rules.Practical implications - Compliance with the GCGC has not proven to be a value-driver for German listed companies. The authors recommend companies to search for opportunities to make their corporate governance more comprehensive by expanding their corporate governance reporting and thus providing deeper insights on how their processes of management and control work.Originality/value - The paper is the first investigation integrating the results of ten years of "code compliance - market valuation" research in Germany. We detect reasons why soft law regulation by corporate governance codes did not function on the German stock market. We additionally address behavioral aspects why investors do not give enough relevance to companies' corporate governance statements so far. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of higher-quality auditors on corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory suggests that managers have incentives to avoid risk in the interests of perquisite consumption and self-preservation, while investors prefer that managers invest in all projects with a positive net present value, i.e. projects that generally increase corporate risk. Empirical literature finds that managerial risk-aversion is mitigated (and firm value enhanced) when investor protection is higher. The authors examine whether higher-quality auditing is one such mechanism to encourage shareholder-focused corporate risk-taking. They model measures of corporate risk as a function of whether a firm is audited by an industry specialist or not, controlling specifically for accounting quality. They then examine the incremental effect of higher-quality audits on other forms of external monitoring (analyst coverage and institutional holdings) for corporate risk. Findings - Using a sample from 2003 to 2007, the authors document a positive relationship between local-level audit industry specialization and both the standard deviation of annual stock returns and research and development expenditures (their measures of corporate risk-taking). They then find the effect is mitigated when firms have alternative external monitoring, in the form of either higher analyst coverage or greater institutional holdings. Research limitations/implications - Given the nature of the question the authors ask, particularly in the context of the auditor- client relationship, a potential limitation is the difficulty in assigning causation. Nonetheless, this study underscores the importance of auditors as an effective mechanism for monitoring corporate managers. Originality/value - This study provides novel evidence that auditors affect managerial decision making beyond a simple effect on financial statements, and should be of interest to boards of directors, regulators and investors.

We examine how time preferences impact the financing decision of firms. We hypothesize that the degree of long-term orientation in a country is positively related to the use of bank relationship lending. Based on a thorough theoretical investigation and an extensive empirical analysis using a large, worldwide dataset, we find strong support for our hypothesis on the role of time preferences for financial intermediation. Our results are robust to controlling for other determinants of the choice of debt financing as well as to applying alternative variables and different estimation methods. Firms in long-term orientation countries appear to prefer relationship bank financing, since it is usually available for the long run and will not be withdrawn quickly in response to adverse developments. This allows managers to preserve a more strategic view and pursue longer planning horizons. (c) 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This research focuses on the relationship between corporate governance and performance in the largest European listed banks, which have been studied to a lesser extent within this field. The study is based on agency theory and we use a sample of 404 observations referring to 97 banks selected from the annual ranking of the 2,000 biggest companies in the world prepared by Forbes. The paper covers the period from 2006 to 2010, thus, examining the changes in the performance drivers in the recent financial crisis. On the basis of the panel data analysis, we confirm that the variety of governance factors including board size, insider appointed, directors' age, board meetings and affiliated committees influence the performance of the banks. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the effect of corporate governance on the financial performance of the financial companies in times of high capital market volatility.

The study investigates the moderating effect of CEO (Chief Executive Officer) duality and CEO ownership on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance. Through reviewing relevant literature on organisational slack, agency and stewardship theories, this study develops hypotheses on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance and the moderations of CEO duality and CEO ownership. On the basis of a large data of Chinese firms, this study finds that there is a positive relationship between organisational slack and firm performance, and the moderating effect of CEO duality is positive, whereas that of CEO ownership is insignificant. The findings not only improve the understanding on the performance implication of organisational slack but also indicates that stewardship theory is more powerful than agency theory in China.

We analyze the direct and simultaneous effects of internationalization on the ownership structure of Latin American companies based on agency theory. Using a sample of 425 Latin American firms between 2007 and 2011, which corresponds to 1,776 observations, we use random effects and three-stage least squares panel data regression to test these effects. We find that the hypothesized positive effect of internationalization on ownership concentration is rejected. Our results support the negative relationship that is predicted by principal-agent theory when analyzing the effect of ownership on the degree of internationalization. Greater internationalization via the equity entry mode is associated with lower levels of ownership concentration. Finally, there is simultaneity in the determination of the relationship between the degree of internationalization and ownership concentration.

The paper aims at identifying impact of corporate governance variables i.e. board structure (board size, board independence, board activity and board busyness) and ownership structure (foreign promoters holding, institutional shareholding and CEO duality) on financial disclosures made by the Indian firms. Using cross sectional data of 325 listed firms for the financial year 2009-10, we compute financial disclosure score (using 171 checklist points) based on disclosure requirements of accounting standards. We find average disclosure score of 73%, maximum and minimum being 100% and 46% respectively. Our finding support agency theory in terms of monitoring role of board since board size is found to be significant however we do not find any influence of board independence on the disclosures. The study also supports resource dependency theory in terms of outside directorship which might provide exposure to different corporate environment, brings diverse perspectives and knowledge to the directors and this in turn leads to improved disclosures. We also support the notion that having foreign promoter shareholding improves disclosures. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This paper critically evaluates the paradigm, theory, and methodology that dominate research on related party transactions (RPTs). RPTs have been debated in the literature whether they are a facet of conflict of interest between major and minor shareholders or they are normal efficient transactions that help the firms to achieve asset utilization. Literature has been widely interested in studying the association between corporate governance and RPTs especially that according to the agency theory it is assumed that corporate governance as a monitoring tool should impede the negative consequences of RPTs and ensure they are conducted to achieve better asset utilization.

This study uses the London Stock Exchange (LSE), forced to demutualize due to major changes in its business environment, notably due to increased competition and technological advances, as field experiment to study corporate governance restructuring to adapt to new market conditions. The LSE improved its financial situation after demutualization and is an example of successful corporate governance restructuring. The LSE significantly restructured the composition of its board of directors following demutualization. The number of exchange members on the LSE board decreased after demutualization while the number of independent directors increased, pointing to a more "monitoring board", in support of an agency theory approach. Interestingly, the large majority of these independent directors had experiences in diverse business. The LSE significantly reorganized its management team to adapt to the new strategies triggered by demutualization and modified its compensation by increasing performance-related payments. Results suggest that demutualization brings efficiencies if accompanied by changes in the governing bodies and in the incentive structures of the exchanges. Most of our results could be relevant also, for example, for firms going public, for smaller firms that are expanding their activities and searching for outside investors and for companies facing major changes in their business environments.

Family governance is a typical governance structure in publicly traded firms in Taiwan and around the world. The founding family of a firm can choose direct ownership or a pyramidal ownership structure to achieve control over a publicly traded family business or a family business group. In addressing performance issues in family businesses, the family ownership structure could generate positive or negative impacts on performance. Thus, determining the contingent condition that will moderate the relationship between family ownership and performance is a key concern in family businesses. Utilizing longitudinal data in family businesses in Taiwan's personal computer industry, this study examines the relationships between the roles of professional managers on the board, the family ownership structure, and the firm's performance from agency theory viewpoint. The results indicate that the professional manager's position on the board will moderate the relationship between the family ownership structure and performance. Specifically, the professional managers serving as directors will enhance the positive impact from family direct ownership on performance and mitigate the negative performance impact from family pyramidal ownership. This study extends the principal-agent and principal-principal agency arguments by further considering the role of the professional manager's position in family businesses.

This study examines the relationship between cross-listing and managerial compensation of Chinese firms that concurrently issued A- and B-shares or A- and H-shares during 2001-2010. The results show that executive compensation is a positive factor to motivate Chinese A-share firms to cross-list as B- or H-shares; it implies that cross-listings could be employed as a way of asset appropriation at the managers' discretion. The results also confirm that corporate governance is important in determining cross-listings. Under the weak corporate governance institution, Chinese firms were chosen to cross-list based on political considerations rather than on economic merits, serving as a vehicle to signal the quality of state owned enterprises. The results are drawn on agency theory, signalling hypothesis and bonding hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Author(s).

Board remuneration in German listed companies becomes more and more subject of public and political discussion, concerning the presumed lack of transparency and too short-term orientation. Besides the increasing regulatory activity, the arrangement of board compensation constitutes a focal economic issue of current empirical corporate governance research. The purpose of our analysis is to identify factors determining the amount and the structure of board compensation in Germany. Our study of 128 German listed companies for the business year 2011 investigates the impact of company-, performance and corporate governance-related factors on board remuneration by means of a multivariate-regression analysis. The analysis indicates that company size has a positive impact and leverage a negative on management board compensation. Furthermore, ROE and return on total capital, as indicators for performance-related variables, both have a positive impact on the average level of management remuneration. However, the corporate governance-related characteristics as ownership concentration and size of the supervisory board have no significant impact on management board remuneration.

This article evaluates the efficiency of existing dividend distribution tax in India from the perspective of investors' preference pattern, as revealed in the market. It investigates the announcement effect of dividend in India in the presence of dividend distribution tax with specific legislative intent of discouraging dividend distribution. Using data on large profitable firms, we show that despite firm-level tax, higher dividend payout announcement leads to significant rise in share price. This implies that despite being tax-disadvantaged, investors of large profitable firms prefer higher payout, because it mitigates agency cost of retention. This shows that dividend distribution tax is inefficient. JEL Classification: G32, G35. (c) 2014, (c) 2014 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.

This study investigates a link between corporate governance and ownership structures on firm performance of 293 companies listed on the Main and Second Board of Bursa Malaysia from 2000- 2006. A dynamic panel system generalized method of moment technique is applied to control the endogeneity effect. After controlling for size, gearing, industry and time, this study finds significant positive relationships between institutional and foreign shareholdings using both market and accounting performance measures. These results imply their positive roles in constraining any opportunistic behavior of management. Interestingly, role duality (positions of Chairman and CEO were the same person) was observed to be negatively related to both performance measures, thus supporting the recommendation by Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG). However, contrary to agency theory and MCCG, firm performance decreases with the increase in proportion of independent directors in the board. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

We provide empirical evidence that support both 'outcome' and 'substitute' models of agency theories related to cash holding. Local long-term institutional investors are associated with lower excess cash in firms with less growth and easier access to external financing, and with higher excess cash in firms with higher growth in our US sample.

Research into the impact of government ownership on the financial performance of listed companies typically assumes the government to be a monolithic entity and fails to consider that government ownership rights are administered by different types of government organizations. Exploring the financial performance of government controlled listed companies we find that in Malaysia the impact of government ownership varies depending on the type of organization which manages the government's ownership stakes. Taking into account golden Share provisions as well as the presence of senior civil servants and of politicians on boards of Directors, we find that firms controlled by investment organizations under federal government control tend to outperform firms controlled by regional governments' investment organizations.

The purpose of this chapter is to examine how the Polish transition from communism to democracy and a market economy shaped the internationalization process of KGHM, a state-controlled local company that in 2011 completed the largest outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in Polish history. Drawing on agency theory, the resource-based view (RBV) and institutional theory, I examine the motives behind the company's foreign investments, its competitive advantages and the challenges it faced while going global. Specifically, I investigate the role of the state and modern capital markets in the process of internationalization of a state-controlled company from a transition economy. The chapter is organized as follows. The first section describes the peculiarities of the Polish transition from communism to democracy and a market economy. The second section presents a literature review in three main areas: Theoretical foundations of research on Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) companies, trends in Polish foreign direct investment (FDI) and empirical studies on the internationalization of state-controlled companies from emerging economies. The third section discusses the research method for the study of KGHM. The ensuing sections discuss the development of KGHM, its internationalization process, the motives for its internationalization and the roles of domestic institutions and resources in its internationalization. The last section provides concluding remarks and addresses the implications of the study presented in the chapter. (c) Mai Thi Thanh Thai and Ekaterina Turkina 2014. All rights reserved.

Compared to other transactions, corporate divestiture is characterized by greater ambiguity and lower transparency, which can be detrimental to stock market reaction. Drawing upon agency theory and information economics literature, this paper examines the relationship between information asymmetries, family ownership and the divestiture financial performance in Western European countries. Based on a sample of 115 Western European divestiture transactions carried out between 1996 and 2010, we find support for the assertion that information asymmetry impacts divestiture financial performance. We also show that the influence of information asymmetries is moderated by family ownership, which acts as a signal of divestiture quality.

This paper investigates the tax and agency explanations of corporate payout policy by investigating the likelihood, the level and the method of payout in founder and family firms. Controlling founders and families are both subject to the tax disadvantage of dividends arising from their substantial shareholdings, but family firms are arguably subject to more severe agency conflicts than founder firms due to their susceptibility to wasteful expenditure and the adverse effects of intra-family conflicts. Results indicate that founder firms on average are less likely and pay a lower level of dividends than family firms. Moreover, founder firms prefer share repurchase over dividends as the main method of payout whereas family firms prefer dividends over share repurchase. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency explanation of corporate payout policy.

This paper examines the monitoring effectiveness of independent and non independent directors on a CEO pay-performance of Malaysian financial firms from 2002-2009. It is based on the agency and managerial power theory. The former states that under optimal contract pay should be aligned to performance, while the latter postulates that powerfully entrenched CEO can influence captive directors to award generous compensation package. Our empirical results show (1) a high CEO pay-dividend sensitivity while market measurement plays no part in influencing CEO pay; (2) both the independent and non independent directors have failed in their fiduciary role as internal monitor, suggesting the dominance of managerial power in the board; (3) the appointment of independent directors is merely a move to fulfill the minimum standards of the best practices of corporate governance.

The interest in researching corporate governance in the broader context continues unabated. The research in this area continues to be dominated by test of agency theory in advanced capitalist economies. Few researches are seen in developing countries like Nigeria. Though there have been calls for new theories to be tested in the field of corporate governance, only few have been tested, predominantly stakeholder and resource dependence theories (Barkema and Gomez-Mejia, 1998). This paper departs from previous literature in two ways. First, it tests the identity theory. Second, it uses the case study drawing empirical data from Nigeria, an emerging economy from a developing capital market to provide insights into the corporate governance mechanisms. This study explores appropriate framework and principles governing the duties and obligations of directors, auditors and secretaries. This is crucial because there is increased reliance by the stakeholders on the three actors (directors, auditors and secretaries) as it concern corporate governance both regionally and internationally. Therefore, an exploratory case study was carried out to explore the level of development of corporate governance mechanism in developing economies like Nigeria. Despite the huge challenges, issues and bottlenecks hampering good corporate governance, the study finds growth in the number of directorships, auditors and secretaries of listed companies. Also, the study reveals the code governing the responsibilities of directors; auditors and secretaries have not produced the desired result pertaining to accountability, transparency and good corporate financial reporting. Thus this adds to the body of knowledge by contributing to the corporate governance system in developing countries. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Introduction Corporate governance has become critical to firms in free markets. Increasingly, investors in international securities markets use corporate governance as an indicator of attractiveness, and then use their leverage to bring about more change in governance structures that pave the way for lucrative future investments (Francis et al. 2005). Furthermore, many emerging countries have embarked on ambitious quests to improve the corporate governance of domestic firms, motivated by the success of these programs in developed economies, and by the wish to attract foreign investment. Improving corporate governance is seen as a way to signal open and friendly markets for foreign investors, such as non-domestic individuals, banks, insurance companies, securities firms and mutual funds (Choe et al. 1999). While most emerging markets display some sort of progress in this direction, research provides mixed evidence as to what causes the changes, and how these changes reflect on the profitability of local firms. For instance, Hafsi and Farashahi (2005: 498) suggest that there is a "trend toward common practices all over the world" due to a "global institutional push toward isomorphism." Likewise, Peng (2004) shows that there is a mimetic pattern in the adoption of Western governance practices in China. Roth and Kostova (2003) argue that changes in governance practices are a result of transition. In this chapter we focus on understanding local firms and their environment. More specifically, several questions spark our interest in the interaction between foreign investors and local firms in emerging markets. Specifically, we first need to understand why local firms of emerging countries adopt Westernized corporate governance practices. We further observe that not all firms of emerging countries make changes to their corporate governance. Thus, it becomes interesting to ask: In light of all the potential benefits as well as pitfalls, why do some firms in emerging countries adopt Western corporate governance practices? A subsequent question emerges in our quest to theoretically analyze response patterns: What are some of the differences in motivation and governance expectations between the local firms attempting to attract foreign investment and the foreign investors? To address these questions, we put forward three propositions which are documented with a real-life case study: The controversy surrounding the proxy fight attempt at KT&G, one of Korea's largest conglomerates. Much of the research on corporate governance in emerging markets concentrates on the regulatory aspects (La Porta et al. 1997; Walker and Fox 2002; Allen 2004; Rossi and Volpin 2004). The premise is that emerging markets have poor financial and economic institutions as compared to developed countries, partly due to some form of transition. As such, changes in corporate governance practices can be initiated through the rule of law, and the implementation of these changes is ensured through coercive mechanisms. This view of corporate governance assumes an active regulative role for local governments and a somewhat passive role for local firms, which act in compliance with regulations (Allen et al. 2005). In our view, this perspective can be enriched by looking at the role of other entities - such as foreign investors, transnational organizations and other international forums - in stimulating direct changes in corporate governance practices in the local market, rather than through the regulative mechanism of the government. In so doing, we may be able to capture potential relationships formed among local firms, or between local firms and organizations other than the local government. Such interactions would be consistent with the institutional perspective of the firm, whereby the firm takes cues from a variety of actors in its environment, and strategic changes may occur because of these relationships, which are sometimes informal. With this chapter, we aim to add to the body of literature that utilizes an institutional logic to analyze relationships between foreign investors and local firms of emerging countries. We acknowledge the common assumption that firms are forced into adoption by mandates from their investors, consistent with the agency theory of the firm. But too often, this seemingly close-fitting assumption can be called into question. Therefore, we turn to the institutional perspective of the firm, which acknowledges other factors that may motivate firms making structural or strategic adjustments.

The aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of insider ownership on firm value which stems from the lack of such study for the case of Romania. By using a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, over the period 2007-2011, our results showed a negative effect of insider shareholdings on firm value. Likewise, the negative effect on firm value was confirmed for insider ownership one-year lagged. Thereby, unconcerned to the level of shareholdings, we ascertained the entrenchment effect, opposite to the goal of shareholders wealth maximization. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

We study the events that motivate CEOs to underinvest in R&D longterm projects (CEO myopia). Based on the existing literature in earnings management and agency theory, myopia is likely to become more problematic under five circumstances: when the CEO nears retirement (the CEO horizon problem), R&D projects have very long time horizons (the project horizon problem), the firm's financial health is deteriorating (the cover-up problem), ownership structure is heavily weighted toward insider owners (minority owner oppression problem), and when the threat of hostile takeover increases (the entrenchment problem). We setup a dynamic simulation model in which rational CEOs maximize the total value of their bonus compensation over their tenure. Our findings related to the five circumstances are consistent with the extant literature. However, we found an unexpected stable, nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between CEO tenure and R&D investment. We discuss the theoretical implications of our model and offer suggestions for future research. Copyright (c) 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We study the relation between initial IPO underpricing and two-tier board structure in the Vienna Stock Exchange of Austria, where a two-tier board is mandatory for listed companies. The board ratio, defined as the size of the supervisory board to the management board, is used to capture the effect of two-tiered board on underpricing. The results show that the board ratio is negatively related with underpricing, consistent with the agency theory which predicts that more effective monitoring implied in a relatively larger supervisory board will lead to lower agency costs, and thus lower underpricing. The results are robust to the inclusion of control variables and suggest that firms seeking to raise external capital will be helped by adopting strong corporate governance standards.

The causal relationship between block premium and the likelihood of shareholder litigation has two possibilities. First, Barclay and Holderness (1989) argue that one of the costs of block ownership is the expected likelihood of litigation. According to this argument, greater ex ante litigation risk will reduce the size of block premium. Second, agency theory suggests that excessive private benefits, the size of which is measured by the block premium, can lead to litigation by disgruntled shareholders. According to this agency-theory hypothesis, greater block premium will indicate a greater likelihood of litigation. Using a sample of 593 block trades in the United States, we find evidence that greater litigation risk at the time of the block trade lowers the block premium, thus supporting the notion that the expected litigation risk is one of the costs of block ownership.

This work concerns the study of the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of listed companies in different contexts, with evidence for nonlinear relationships. The sample consisting of 146 companies is grouped in 46 Portuguese and 100 British companies. The multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression were used. It was concluded that the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of companies in different contexts is diverse and that there are nonlinear relationships whose effect represents an important contribution to understand the governance model.

Although studies about the determinants of CEO compensation are ubiquitous, the balance of evidence for one of the more controversial theoretical approaches, managerial power theory, remains inconclusive. The authors provide a meta-analysis of 219 U.S.-based studies, focusing on the relationships between indicators of managerial power and levels of CEO compensation and CEO pay-performance sensitivities. The results indicate that managerial power theory is well equipped for predicting core compensation variables such as total cash and total compensation but less so for predicting the sensitivity of pay to performance. In most situations where CEOs are expected to have power over the pay setting process, they receive significantly higher levels of total cash and total compensation. In contrast, where boards are expected to have more power, CEOs receive lower total cash and total compensation. In addition, powerful directors also appear to be able to establish tighter links between CEO compensation and firm performance and can accomplish this even in the face of powerful CEOs. The authors discuss the implications for theory and research regarding the determinants of executive compensation. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This research investigates the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in the context of a transitional economy characterised by an underdeveloped corporate governance system. Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies in Vietnam covering a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011, we examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. We find that board gender diversity appears to have an effect on firm performance. This finding remains robust when alternative proxies for gender diversity are employed and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The number of female directors in the boardroom also matters, supporting the view that if female board representation affects firm outcomes, this effect is more pronounced when the number of female directors increases. It is observed, furthermore, that the marginal positive performance effect of board gender diversity ceases when the percentage of female directors reaches a breakpoint of about 20%. This finding suggests that there is perhaps a potential trade-off between the costs and benefits of board gender diversification. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing literature of non-US based studies, by providing robust empirical evidence from a transitional economy in East Asia. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, the relationship between ownership concentration and financial performance of companies in Singapore and Vietnam is investigated in a dynamic framework. By focusing on two different types of national governance systems (well-developed vs. under-developed), we observe how the relationship is moderated by the national governance quality. We find that the performance effect of concentrated ownership persists in these markets even after the dynamic nature of the ownership concentration-performance relationship is taken into consideration. Our finding supports the prediction of agency theory about the efficient monitoring effect of large shareholders in markets with highly concentrated ownership. In addition, we find that national governance quality does matter when explaining the ownership concentration-performance relationship. The positive effect of concentrated ownership on performance of firms operating in the under-developed national governance system (Vietnam) tends to be stronger than that in the well-established system (Singapore). This finding is consistent with the argument that ownership concentration is an efficient corporate governance mechanism which can substitute for weak national governance quality. Econometrically, our findings still hold even after controlling for dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity, inherent in the corporate governance-performance relationship.

By complementing agency theory with behavioral assumptions, we explore the effects of family involvement on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. We identify three separate dimensions of family involvement and hypothesize nonlinear, direct, and interaction effects on the performance of an SME. The evidence on 787 SMEs suggests that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between family ownership and performance, and ownership dispersion among family members negatively affects performance. Balancing family and nonfamily members in the top management team (TMT) is found to be beneficial to SMEs' performance, but the family ratio in the TMT becomes crucial only at high levels of family ownership.

This paper investigates the effect of the 2009 guidance of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs on greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosure. The sample comprises 215 companies from a population of London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 companies over four years (2008-2011). To quantify GHG disclosure, a research index methodology is employed, with information derived from several GHG reporting frameworks. The econometric model is estimated using panel fixed effects. Our findings suggest that the publication of the 2009 guidance has had a significant effect on the level of GHG disclosure, and that corporate governance mechanisms (board size, director ownership, and ownership concentration) also affect the extent of GHG information disclosure. The results also indicate that companies increased their disclosures prior to the 2009 guidance in anticipation of its publication. These results have important implications for the government, suggesting that non-mandatory guidance could increase disclosure as much as do mandatory requirements. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Family firms often evolve into ownership constellations with multiple family owners. Building on agency theory, we argue that the growing complexity within a group of family blockholders gives rise to what we label family blockholder conflicts, defined as conflicts within a group of family owners. To curb family blockholder conflicts, families often separate the family from its assets and install intermediary governance structures. We explore four frequently applied structures (uncoordinated family, embedded family office, single family office, and family trust), which vary in their degree of separation between family owners and assets and consequently the extent to which the firm might incur family blockholder costs and the double-agency costs associated with appointing agents to oversee agents. We conclude with a discussion of the distributive effects of the four family governance constellations for family wealth over time. (c) 2015 Baylor University.

We review what the financial economics literature has to say about the unique ways in which the following three classic agency problems manifest themselves in family firms: (a) shareholders versus managers, (b) controlling (family) shareholders versus noncontrolling shareholders, and (c) shareholders versus creditors. We also call attention to a fourth agency problem that is unique to family firms: the conflict of interest between family shareholders and the family at large, which can be thought of as the "superprincipal" in a multi-tier agency structure akin to those found in other concentrated ownership structures in which the controlling owner is the state, a bank, a corporation, or other institutions. We then discuss the solutions or corporate governance mechanisms that have been devised to address these problems and what research has taught us about these mechanisms' effectiveness at solving these four conflicts in family firms.

This study examines the influence of board independence on firm agency cost among listed firms in Bangladesh, which feature concentrated ownership and high insider representation on corporate boards. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction' and the 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding of the study is that board independence can reduce the firm agency cost only under 'asset utilization ratio' measure of agency cost. These findings are robust to several robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the benefit of outside independent directors is generally plausible as a factor controlling agency costs in the case of a medium level of board independence. Overall, these findings do not reject the validity of agency theory, supporting the Anglo-American orthodoxy promoting outside independent directors as good monitors.

Relying on an alternative theoretical framework (i.e. institutional theory), rather than the dominant agency theory, this paper examines the connections between corporate governance mechanisms and good practices, as informed by an empirical and contextual analysis. On the basis of research methods triangulation, this study presents nine specific antecedents of good corporate governance in weak institutional settings (Nigeria). The study proposes how each of these antecedents must be understood, articulated and harnessed, on the basis of relevant institutional peculiarities, in order to address contextual governance challenges. This study adds to the institutional theorising of good corporate governance, by paying attention to the context (African), efficiency (instrumentality) and legitimacy (symbolic) in explaining the firm-level drivers of good governance practices in an international business environment.

How do host country institutions influence the value of a firm's local resources? Using a novel dataset on the performance of 47 private equity (PE) firms in 49 emerging economies, we show evidence that the answer depends on the type of institution. Focusing on conditions at the time of initial investment, we find that PE firms with local origins and foreign PE firms with local experience performed better when contract enforcement institutions were weak than when they were strong. Financial development, in contrast, may have undermined the value of PE firm local origins. These results help reconcile contrasting findings on how host country institutions influence performance and lead us to contend that unbundling institutions is necessary for continued development of the institutions-based view.

We examine the effect of family control on IFRS mandatory disclosure levels, and the valuation implications of these disclosure levels, for Malaysian companies. We find that family control is related negatively to disclosure and that compliance levels are not value relevant. These findings suggest that agency theory predictions and theories linking common law legal systems to high quality financial reporting require refining in certain national contexts. Where Type 2 agency problems dominate, institutional arrangements intended to enhance financial reporting quality aimed at mitigating Type 1 problems in developed markets may have limited effect in less developed jurisdictions.

This study examines the association between Chinese stock issuers' board characteristics and dividends. We focus on the gender of CEO and accompanying board members, as well as other salient board demographics and characteristics. Using more than 9,000 firm-year observations, we observe little difference in the dividend distributions of female- and male-led Chinese firms. Other salient demographics, notably CEO age and tenure bear a strong positive association with cash distributions. Cash pay-out is also increasing in directors' equity stakes and state ownership. In a general sense, the proportion of independent directors on boards bears only limited association with cash pay-out. However, in state-invested entities, greater independent director presence acts as a brake against cash distributions. We challenge a lingering perception in the investment literature that women are significantly more risk-averse than men. Cross-cultural theory suggests that risk aversion is manifest in greater cash retention and thus lower pay-outs (Bae, Chang, & Kang, The Journal of Financial Research, 35(2): 289-316, 2012; Khambata & Liu, Journal of Asia-Pacific Business, 6(4): 31-43, 2005). Building on this literature, and extending it specifically to gender, our results are consistent with male and female CEOs displaying comparable levels of risk aversion. They are also congruent with "financial knowledge" lessening gender-based differences in risk aversion (Hibbert, Lawrence, & Prakash, Global Finance Journal, 24: 140-152, 2013) and/or its general absence in the specific field of financial decisions (Schubert, Brown, Gysler, & Brachinger, The American Economic Review, 89(2): 381-385, 1999). We also emphasize theory on managerial power (Allen, Social Forces, 60(2): 482-494, 1981) and entrenchment. Results for CEO tenure and age support notions of CEO entrenchment, while those for duality do not. In contrast to agency theory, but consistent with tunneling arguments, the present study stresses the overarching role of state-ownership in increasing (decreasing) cash (stock) payouts. We observe non-monotonic effects in this relation, thus extending related findings elsewhere (Huang, Chen, & Kao, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29: 39-58, 2012).

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

There remains a good deal of uncertainty as to whether and under which governance conditions family firms, even large, publicly traded ones, are entrepreneurial. We shall argue that agency theory, behavioral agency perspectives, and the resource-based view all posit both positive and negative influences regarding entrepreneurship in family firms, while empirical studies, collectively, are no less ambiguous in their findings. We use each of the above theories to propose various governance distinctions that can reconcile these contradictions and suggest when family firms will be most and least entrepreneurial.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of corporate governance on intellectual capital (IC) in top service firms in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, the paper develops hypotheses about relationships between corporate governance mechanisms (chief executive officer [CEO] duality, board size, board composition and subcommittee composition) and IC. The study uses a multiple regression analysis on data collected from corporate annual reports of 300 firm-year observations. Findings - The findings of the regression analysis indicate that CEO duality, board composition and remuneration committee composition are significantly associated with IC. In contrast, there is no evidence that board size and audit committee composition have an effect on IC. The study contributes to agency theory in general and the literature on IC and corporate governance more specifically. Practical implications - The findings of the study might be of interest to regulators, investment analysts, shareholders, company directors and managers in Australia, as well as academics, in designing corporate governance mechanisms to develop IC. Originality/value - Corporate governance is country-specific and, hence, its impact on managerial decisions leading to IC is different from country to country. This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between corporate governance and IC in top service firms in Australia. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - How family businesses (FBs) manage to survive in the long term is still not well understood in FB research. A promising concept to explain survivability, that is currently heavily discussed in the management literature is organizational ambidexterity (OA) - the ability to balance exploring and exploiting activities at the same time. However, FB research has not yet taken sufficient advantage of the potential of OA to contribute to explaining the ability of later-generation FBs to survive. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using central tenets of agency theory, this conceptual paper draws together findings from the FB literature and the OA literature to create a framework for the relationship between family involvement and the ability to reach high levels of OA. Findings - Seven propositions are developed which suggest that the level of family involvement in ownership and management affect the ability of later-generation FBs to reach high levels of OA. They further suggest that the number of family shareholders, the existence of majority family shareholders, and generational involvement of the controlling family in management moderate these relationships. Originality/value - This is the first paper to theoretically analyze OA in later-generation FBs. The seven propositions and avenues for further research presented in this paper are intended to motivate FB research to take a closer look at OA. This may be crucial to better explaining and predicting one of business-owning families' most important goals: the long-term survival of the FB. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747.

This article analyses founding family influence on pay-out policies for Swiss listed firms over the period 2003-2010. We hypothesise that family firms have different incentives and characteristics that affect pay-out decisions and propose three possible explanations: agency theory, reputation building and family income needs. Our results show that founding family firms display significantly higher dividend pay-outs relative to companies with other ownership structures. We also examine specific family characteristics and document that a family's stake, active involvement and generation play an important role in determining pay-out policies. Our findings appear to be consistent with the family income hypothesis and to some extent with reputational concerns. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Building on agency theory and international business research, this paper explores how parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors affect FDI location decisions in emerging economies. Our analysis suggests that ownerships of block-shareholders in the parent firm (i.e., controlling family, non-family TMT members and institutional investors) and equity stake in a subsidiary owned by the parent company are positively associated with FDI location decisions in less-explored and risky areas. However, the effects of parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors may substitute for each other with respect to their integrated effect on dealing with risks associated with FDI location decisions.

An effective board of directors is central to agency theory's prescription to solving the problems of separation of ownership from control in the modern corporation. The shareholders' confidence in the board's ability to fulfil its duties is an important measure of the success or otherwise of this cornerstone of agency theory. The Board Shareholder Confidence Index focuses on the board of directors and is the standard by which Canadian governance best practices are measured. This paper investigates the relationship between board effectiveness and company performance. Using a sample of 699 firm year observations from 2003 to 2009, we find a positive association between the firm's measure of board effectiveness and the firm's contemporaneous and future market measure of performance, Tobin's Q. The results hold across a number of econometric models that control for different types of endogeneities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We analyze CEO turnover in closely held firms with some level of ownership dispersion in a context of low investor protection. In particular, we examine the impact of family involvement on CEO turnover and CEO turnover/performance sensitivity. We argue that family involvement in management, ownership, and control has both a direct effect on CEO turnover from the family presence itself, and a moderating effect over CEO turnover/performance sensitivity attributable to the agency tensions between majority and minority shareholders (whether other family blocks or non-family shareholders). Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 1996-2006 for 523 Colombian firms, we find direct and moderating effects, depending on the type of family involvement. Family involvement in management and boards reduces CEO turnover, but family involvement in ownership increases it. Regarding moderating effects, family involvement in ownership reduces CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, while the opposite occurs with family directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results show that closely held firms in emerging markets exhibit a strong negative CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, which is a somewhat counterintuitive result, and also contribute to a better understanding of agency conflicts within family firms by highlighting the different ways families affect CEO turnover. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that even benevolently entrenched family CEOs are not immune to poor financial performance. Families that are majority or controlling shareholders may support CEOs even when the firm performs poorly because of potential benefits from control. Family boards are very sensitive to financial performance even when the CEO is a family member. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory predicts that incentives will align agents' interests with those of principals. However, the resource-based view suggests that to be effective, the incentive to deliver must be paired with the ability to deliver. Using Fortune 500 boards as an empirical context, this study shows that the presence of directors who lack top-level experience but own large shareholdings is negatively associated with firm value, an effect that increases in the number of such directors. Firm value rises after such directors depart from boards, with the greatest increases occurring when many of these directors leave. While agency theory highlights the importance of the right incentives being in place, this research suggests that this can be ineffective if the right resources are not also in place.

In this paper we examine the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Using a multinational sample of newly privatised firms from 43 countries, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that dividend payout is negatively related to government ownership, consistent with the predictions of agency theory. We also find that country-level corporate governance affects the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Specifically, the adverse effects of government ownership on dividend policy are more pronounced in countries with weak law and order and a lower level of checks and balances. Our results are important, as they show that government ownership, as well as the institutional environment, does in fact affect the critical corporate policies, such as dividend policy, of newly privatised firms.

Unlike business models of private banks based on profit maximization and shareholder-oriented governance, alternative banks (such as cooperative banks, government savings banks, and special purpose banks) share business models based on sustainable returns with longer time horizons, corporate missions that include social and public policy goals, and stakeholder-oriented governance. Strong evidence from recent research suggests that alternative banks often equal or outperform joint-stock banks in terms of efficiency, profitability, and risk management. This counters core ideas in contemporary banking theory and expectations of regulators about the superiority of private ownership and market-based banking. Concepts and theories from banking studies help explain how alternative banks outperform private banks in core functions such as creating and managing liquidity, pooling deposits, and reducing information asymmetries and agency costs. However, heterodox theories of the firm and institutional approaches to competitive advantage broaden the scope of analysis to explain further historical, social, and organizational advantages (and risks) in alternative banking. Alternative banks therefore require, and may inspire, alternative theories of banking and new approaches to bank regulation. (c) Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.

Recently, outside blockholders, external owners that hold 5% or more of their firms' outstanding common stockholdings, have been pressuring their firms to engage in divestiture activities. This study considers whether the influence of those owners also extends to how the divestiture is implemented, whether through spin-off or sell-off. Tests of an agency theory model using data from 205 divestitures show that the adoption of spin-offs or sell-offs is associated with the amount of outstanding common stockholdings held by outside blockholders and the size of the unit divested. Spin-offs are used more frequently when outside blockholders own more of the divesting firm's stockholdings and the divested unit is larger, while sell-offs tend to be selected when outside blockholders own less stock and the divested business is smaller. Consistent with agency theory expectations, spin-offs would allow the blockholders to decide whether to hold or sell their interests in the divested firm, a decision they could make in accordance with their individual portfolio risks. Sell-offs of small units could be used to preserve organizational diversity and produce proceeds that would help the divesting firm's managers pursue their self-interests. Overall, outside blockholders appear to shape how divestitures are done, even if they cannot directly intervene in their firms' operations. (c) The Author(s) 2012

In this study we examine the relation between ownership structure and corporate performance; the sample of the study included 42 out of 48 companies of all sectors in Bahrain Bourse in five years from 2007-2011. Several dimensions of ownership concentration were studied in addition to managerial and institutional ownership. Two different measurements of performance were used (ROA and Tobin's Q). The study investigated this relation using several control variables and 2SLS statistical method to overcome the problem of endogeneity that may exist between the study variables. It was found that ownership concentration have a negative effect with statistical significance on company performance. Institutional ownership was found to have a positive effect on company performance. Managerial ownership was not found to have a significant effect on company performance, however it was found that managerial ownership has a positive effect on performance only in the case of declining ownership concentration. Other results were revealed by the study regarding company age, size, growth, board size and liquidity. The study is considered to have theoretical and practical implications. It contributes to the debate about agency theory and managerial entrenchment. It also may help officials in Bahrain in making laws and legislations concerning corporate governance improvement in Bahraini market.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines how separation of cash flow and voting rights influences performance of firms affiliated with large family business groups. Complementing the dominant view grounded in agency theory, we suggest that the separation of cash flow and voting rights has positive influence on firm performance in the context of large family business groups. Research Findings/Insights: Using the data from the large family business groups in Korea, or Chaebols, between 2003 and 2010, we found that the separation is positively associated with firm accounting performance, but not with market performance. We also found that the effect of the separation is moderated by analyst coverage, R&D expenditure, and sales share in the business group. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study reveals that in the large family business groups, the context in which the separation most frequently occurs, the separation not only induces the controlling minority shareholders to pursue private benefits of control but also accompanies financing benefits from active use of the internal capital market. In addition, this study notes the importance of addressing the endogeneity in the analysis of the relation between ownership structure and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers planning to enforce/revoke the regulation on the separation of cash flow and voting rights in the pursuit of corporate governance reform especially in countries with poor shareholder protection.

This study examines the effect of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) on audit fees, and assesses whether and how this effect varies across different countries. We specifically consider publicly listed firms in the US and Japan over the eight-year period centered around the dates on which XBRL was first mandated for use by publicly listed firms in these jurisdictions. Our comparative results show that XBRL use is inversely associated with audit fees, which are in turn positively associated with firm size. We also find that, overall, XBRL moderates the association between firm size and audit fees in both the US and Japan. However, these moderation effects are weaker among Japanese firms.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: How do firm-level attributes and country-level institutions affect cross-national and firm-level differences in how minority owner rights in family firms are protected? Research Insights: We consider differences in family dynamics, stewardship-oriented organizational culture, and countries' legal and cultural dimensions to develop theory predicting differences in minority owner protection in family firms. We advance propositions and a model delineating the role of these key firm-level and country-level constructs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the literature in three ways: (1) We illustrate the importance of family dynamics for predicting the likelihood of a stewardship-oriented culture to emerge in a family firm; (2) our multi-level and cross-national approach extends earlier explanations of agency and stewardship that are centered at the firm, family, and individual levels of analysis; and (3) we consider the impact of cross-cultural dimensions on family firms, an area that has received limited attention in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research implies that individuals considering becoming a minority owner in a family firm should take into account not only the legal institutions of that country (which might not be as strong as they first seem) but also intra-firm family dynamics and the prevalent norms and values of the firm's national culture to get a more complete picture of the protections available to them.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using agency theory and socioemotional wealth perspective as the theoretical framework, we evaluate the extent to which financing choices subsequent to going public and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to non-family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that family firms maintain higher post-IPO leverage and longer debt maturity structure relative to non-family firms. Further, family firms raise less external capital subsequent to going public relative to non-family firms. The reluctance of family firms to raise post-IPO capital, however, results in higher investment sensitivity to internal cash flows and consequently inefficient investment. In addition, family firm financing choices differentially influence various facets of post-IPO performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that agency conflicts among firm stakeholders as well as socioemotional wealth considerations are important determinants of family firm financing behavior subsequent to going public. Further, ownership structure is an important determinant of the extent IPO firms capitalize on the opportunity to raise capital subsequent to going public to finance investments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results offer insights to entrepreneurs, managers, venture capitalists, and other capital market participants with regard to the link between firm ownership structure and the economic benefits of going public (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

To examine the bribing behavior of firms, we developed a cross-level moderation model using agency theory at the firm level and anomie theory at the societal level to investigate the relationship between manager control of firms and firm bribery activity. The results of this cross-cultural analysis using a sample of 1,799 firms from 38 nations showed that at the firm level, manager-controlled firms (MCFs) have a higher propensity to bribe than shareholder-controlled firms. At the country level, bribery is higher in MCFs (relative to shareholder-controlled firms) in societies with a low level of institutional collectivism, a high level of uncertainty avoidance, economic change, and income inequality. Contrary to the hypothesis, the relationship between bribery and manager control is stronger rather than weaker in societies with press freedom. Implications for future research and practices are discussed. (c) 2015 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.

Purpose - This paper aims to present an analysis of the association between five categories of concentrated ownership and firm performance in Pakistan. The connection between high ownership concentration and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging market, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach - Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)-100 Indexed companies listed in KSE from 2007 to 2011 were selected as the sample, and correlation coefficient and regression model were used to inspect the relationship between ownership concentration degree and corporate performance. Findings - It was found that there is no significant association with ownership concentration and accounting-based performance, market-based performance measures and economic profit, in general. Originality/value - The first demonstration that the shareholding proportion of the single largest shareholder is the only variable having positive association with market-based performance measures (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Objective - The purpose of this work is to examine the influence of ownership concentration on the funds allocated to CSR in Brazilian firm. Design/methodology/approach - Econometric models have been estimated, with an index of CSR as the dependent variable, and ownership concentration as the explanatory variable, together with relevant control variables suggested in the literature (profitability, leverage, growth opportunities, and firm size). A Brazilian CSR database has been built using data extracted from two different sources, one relative to CSR data and another that provides ownership structure and financial data. CSR policy is proxied by an index obtained as the ratio between funds directed to social action (employee relations, external social actions, and environmental action) and net sales. Findings - The findings indicate that CSR is positively influenced by firm ownership concentration in Brazil. Practical implications - The positive influence of ownership concentration on CSR may be an indication that large controlling shareholders of Brazilian firm may be considering CSR as an effective way to improve the image and reputation of the firm and its owners. This belief may be stimulating CSR projects and their disclosure in Brazil. Originality/value - This work is an additional contribution to the debate about the role played by ownership structure on CSR. Taking into account that the central point of Stakeholder Theory is a firm's concern with all its stakeholders, the research builds on Stakeholder and Agency Theories by assessing the influence of large controlling shareholders on a firm's social concerns.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between corporate ownership structures and audit fees paid to external auditors by Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. This study focusses on the extent of the auditor's reliance on the client's internal control inasmuch as the corporate ownership structures are varied, and, ultimately, affect the audit fees. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the agency theory in formulating three hypotheses that guide the results analysis. By employing a multi regression model for a sample of 345 Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, this study examines the relationship of ownership structure, namely, managerial ownership, foreign ownership and government ownership with audit fees using data for 2010. Findings - The results show a significant positive relationship between audit fees and firms with larger foreign ownership and government ownership but no significant relationship with firms with higher managerial ownership. This study contributes recent evidence concerning the relationship between corporate ownership structure and audit fees. Practical implications - Regulators may consider ownership structure on the standards or regulation setting in order to be practical and operationalized in line with the impact associated with different ownership structures. The practitioners may also design appropriate methodologies and procedures for the different ownership structures for high-quality service and to standardize the risk mitigation process. Social implications - The ownership structures have different influences on the audit fees, as well as complexity of the firms and their profitability. Originality/value - The study looks upon certain percentages of ownership structures, and how they affects audit fees, firms complexity and profitability. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The 2011 Tunisian revolution has played a role in bringing the corporate governance agenda to the forefront. This political change in Tunisia has revealed persistent governance problems in its banking industry. This paper presents the results of research conducted on how different aspects of corporate governance can influence bank performance. The sample comprises 10 Tunisian commercial banks for the period from 1997 to 2010. The performance-governance relationship is estimated using a range of econometric techniques. The findings reveal strong support for a negative association between blockholder ownership and performance. Our results show that the bank board size is related to directors' ability to monitor and advise management. Additionally, CEO duality is positively associated with performance. Further analysis suggests that the presence of government officials on banks' board of directors decreases bank performance. Taken together, our findings offer recommendations to regulators, especially for the on-going financial reform of corporate boards.

Based on the assumptions of agency theory, family business researchers have often argued that family firms are less likely to use formal methods of monitoring and control than nonfamily firms. We explore the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement among the owners, a formal measure of control. We hypothesize economic goals and perceived level of risk taking and management efficacy will mediate the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement. Results indicate that the primary goal of the firm serves as a partial mediator of this relationship. (c) 2015 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper aims to explore the differing attitudes of salaried chief financial officers (CFOs) that can be associated with agency theory and stewardship theory. CFO attitudes are investigated because CFOs typically face additional agency conflict in their roles as overseers of the financial and accounting functions that are responsible for the production of numerical information used as a basis for incentive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative field study of 14 large privately held Austrian manufacturing companies was conducted. The findings rely on information retrieved from 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with individuals from these companies. Findings - The findings reveal a number of contextual factors that influence stewardship and agency attitudes of salaried CFOs. CFOs, who mainly report formally to owners, perceive more control in the hands of the owners. Short-term management appointments appear to facilitate agency-like behavior, whereas the existence of owner-managers and the typical CFO's maturity in terms of age and wealth seem to nurture stewardship behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further (quantitative) research is needed to corroborate the findings in this study, which are derived from a qualitative research approach. Further research on agency and stewardship behavior should also include the view of principal with respect to agent actions, as this paper shows that principal opinion strongly affects the way agents perceive control. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the behavior of company owners can influence and change a manager's agency or stewardship attitude. Owners who desire a culture of stewardship should set long-term goals and facilitate long-term management appointments. Moreover, owners can lower a manager's perceived level of owner control by adopting an active role in management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to analyze stewardship and agency attitude of salaried CFOs in privately held companies. It, therefore, adds to the current literature on the role of the CFO, as well as to the literature on governance issues in privately held firms. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is well known that firms with low price to earnings ratios (value firms) earn higher stock returns in the long term than high price to earnings firms (growth firms). This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects. For low P/E firms, low stock returns reflect the inability of boards of directors and outside shareholders to influence poorly performing entrenched management. For high P/E firms, boards of directors and outside shareholders are less likely to intervene since higher returns reflect increased agency incentives for value-creating managers.

Purpose - This review paper aims to compare the various dimensions in the finance literature pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon Model (Stockholder Model) prevalent in the USA and the UK with the German Model (Stakeholder Model) of corporate governance prevalent in Germany and continental Europe. The present study identifies different strands of research on the various dimensions of these models, along with aspects of governance in emerging economies and the phenomenon of the convergence of these governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The literature review on corporate governance models has been carried out on the themes of internal and external governance mechanisms. The review considers agency theory along with principal-principal (PP) conflicts as the fundamental blocks explaining the need for governance structures. Findings - The traditional models of governance, along with the incorporation of PP conflicts, will result in a hybrid model inculcating the best of both the traditional models. However, convergence in the true sense may not be possible owing to fundamental differences pertaining to cultural, economic, legal and socio-economic aspects of the firm. Originality/value - This paper proposes a framework incorporating the interplay of managerial talent and controlling shareholders to understand the governance system that may be applicable for firms in emerging economies.

The board of directors plays an important role in corporate governance. It is an internal mechanism that controls and monitors the actions of managers and aligns the utility functions between corporate owners and managers. The board of directors performs multiple functions that concern, for example, the replacement of the managers, financial policy, the preparation of strategic plans and other actions that affect the performance of the company. The board plays an important role since on the one hand it controls the actions of management and on the other it advises the management regarding the strategies to be adopted. In this study, 100 announcements regarding the appointment of the board of directors of 100 Italian listed companies during the period 2012-2014 are investigated. The results show a positive reaction within 20 days around the announcement date. In four of the six time windows, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are positive and statistically significant. The positive reaction of the market would appear, however, to be linked more to the composition of the board of directors than to the size of the board of directors.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Former audit demand studies generally consider wholly family-owned private firms as a homogeneous group of firms that incur minimal agency costs. Family firm literature, however, argues that these firms might incur significant agency costs as well and we therefore examine audit demand in this particular type of firm. As we examine private family firms from the USA, which have no audit requirement, we broaden the concept of audit demand to the demand for auditor services, which encompasses audits, reviews and compilations. Consistent with former audit demand studies, we hypothesise a negative association between management ownership and the demand for auditor services, but only for first-generation private family firms. We hypothesise that this relation turns positive for subsequent generation private family firms due to entrenching behaviour caused by weakened altruistic feelings between the family shareholders. Our results support this hypothesis, but only regarding the demand for reviews and compilations. Therefore, our findings suggest that reviews and compilations seem to be sufficient and more cost-effective in this specific context to mitigate shareholder-manager agency costs compared to more expensive audits. Moreover, results suggest that the level of shareholder-debtholder agency costs do seem to be a driver for the demand for audits. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

We analyze the presence of activist investors (hedge funds and private equity funds) and their impact on top management turnover in Germany. We contrast two hypotheses. The monitoring hypothesis is based on agency theory. Under this hypothesis, we expect active investors to increase top management turnover as a consequence of their monitoring efforts. Under the restraint hypothesis, we expect active investors to exert little influence on top management turnover in consequence of the comparatively limited discretion they have in Germany due to, e.g., regulatory restraints. We test both hypotheses using an event history analysis based on a sample of top managers in the 100 largest German corporations between 1998 and 2008. Contrary to studies based on agency theory in a US context, and in accordance with the restraint hypothesis, we do not find increased top management turnover under the presence of activist investors. The presence of private equity funds is not associated with any significant influence on turnover, but that of hedge funds may even reduce top management turnover.

In this paper, we use unique features of Pakistan's corporate environment to test information asymmetry and agency theories in explaining dividend smoothing behaviour of firms. Based on a sample of 150 non-financial firms listed at the Karachi Stock Exchange over the period of 1999 to 2012, we find evidence that the degree of dividend smoothing in family firms is lower than the degree of dividend smoothing in non-family firms. Our findings are more in line with the implications of information asymmetry theory. Moreover, our findings suggest that firms in Pakistan follow more flexible dividend policies as compared to developed markets, despite the fact that Pakistan is in classical tax system.

The weak corporate governance framework in Indonesia, as in other countries in Southeast Asia, was deemed a crucial factor in deepening the financial and economic crisis in the late 1990s. Over a decade after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries have made substantial governance reforms. The reform measures of the institutional framework, both in the public and corporate sectors, were intended to transform Indonesia into a clean, transparent, and accountable country. While the reforms have resulted in increased political stability, improved government effectiveness, and a more conducive investment climate, corruption remains a major concern in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate how corporate governance mechanisms can reduce the opportunities for corruption. By utilizing agency theory, we argue that a strong corporate governance institutional framework helps to reduce a country's level of corruption. We focus attention on three components of corporate governance mechanisms, i.e., shareholder rights, the quality of the board of directors (BoD), and appropriate accounting and auditing standards, including transparency standards. In an attempt to strengthen corporate governance standards and practices in Indonesia, we conducted a comparative study among Southeast Asian middle-income countries, i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We rely on accessible secondary data such as corporate governance codes, laws, and regulations. Our study concludes that the Indonesian corporate governance institutional framework is less stringent compared to Malaysia and Thailand. This condition provides a favorable environment for corruption to persist because the standards and practices are less demanding and the companies do not necessarily have to comply with the existing regulatory framework.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between ownership concentration and company performance in China private listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - By taking into account of the difference of managerial positions of large shareholders in listed companies (whether they assume the posts as presidents or general managers), and based on the two agency theories, the paper analyzes the state dependency of the relationship between ownership concentration and the company performance of listed companies with the samples of China private listed companies from 2003 to 2011. Findings - The paper finds that if the large shareholders assume no posts in the listed companies, there is an inverted U shape relation between shareholding ratio of the largest shareholders and the company performance. This result indicates the inadequate or excessive monitoring to the companies by the large shareholders according to different shareholding ratios. If large shareholders assume posts in the listed companies, there is a U shape relation between shareholding ratio of the largest shareholders and the company performance. This result indicates the tunneling and propping to the small shareholders by the large shareholders according to different shareholding ratios. Research limitations/implications - This paper has not taken the influence of earnings management of the listed companies. Practical implications - For strengthening the protection of investors, proper distinction shall be made among shareholders of different conditions, and difference of roles large shareholders play in the company under different conditions shall be understood correctly, so as to formulate and perfect market rules for corporate governance, rather than just restraining the power (rights) of large shareholders. The study in this paper is for helping understand the different roles large shareholders play under different corporate governance conditions. Originality/value - First, different from the research paradigm of relationship between ownership concentration and company performance in existing literature, the paper discriminates the study background with the post-assuming conditions of large shareholders in listed companies and believes that relationship between ownership concentration and company performance shall be presented differently under different post-assuming conditions. Second, by using monitoring theory and tunneling and propping theory to explain the behaviors of large shareholders under different post-assuming conditions respectively, a new theory explanation view is provided for explaining the relation between ownership concentration and company performance.

We used the annual reports of nearly all non-bank companies listed on the PSE as well as the company guides issued by the PSE for the period between 2010 and 2012. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structures and company characteristics on the voluntary formation of ACs among non-bank Palestinian firms. The result of the analysis demonstrated that the AC is influenced by foreign ownership, institutional ownership, board diligence and external auditor type. This paper adds to the limited AC literature in Middle Eastern countries in general and in the Arab World in particular. This paper not only examines the determinants of the voluntary formation of ACs but also attempts to theorise about this formation.

This study provides an overview of the research in the field of agency theory and corporate governance. This research is aimed to extend existing research contributes to the agency theory literature and particularly, the growing body of literature of corporate governance mechanisms. The agency theory suggests that corporate governance can reduce agency costs which in turn leads to improved firm performance. The problem that occurs is known as the principal-agent problem where two parties, the principal and the agent. The separation of ownership and control in the open financial system can result in the agency problem between management and shareholders. The separation of control and ownership in corporations has caused agency problems and a series of corporate governance mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate them. The primary objective of corporate governance can play an important role in minimizing the agency problem and ensuring that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The agency theory implies that the board of directors is elected to manage the potential conflict of interests between management and shareholders. (c) Medwell Journals, 2015.

We study the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of the governance codes in the new-institutional theory, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesise that the code recommendations are influenced by the isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types of issuer. The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholder groups and organisations in hybrid committees are more likely to: 1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; 2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholder groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the recommendations of the code and in improving the promotion of good governance among firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of codes, in a global sample.

This study examines the moderation effects of corporate governance provisions on the link between family involvement (i.e., family ownership and family management) in publicly-traded firms and firm performance by drawing upon agency theory, with a focus on principal-principal agency issues, and the extant family governance literature. We develop and test the hypotheses on 386 of the S&P 500 firms longitudinally. Findings support the hypotheses suggesting the moderation effects of the use of provisions (a) protecting controlling owners in terms of their sustainability of controlling status, and (b) protecting management legally on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family ownership and firm performance. We also found support for the moderation effects of provisions (c) protecting controlling owners in terms of their voting rights, (d) protecting noncontrolling owners, and (e) protecting management monetarily on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family management and firm performance. By this, our study provides empirical support for the principal-principal agency perspective on the corporate governance in publicly-traded family firms. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the theory of the family firm. Our study also offers insights to policy directed toward monitoring the actions of large shareholders such as family and enhancing the overall shareholder value in publicly-traded family firms.

This study examines the association between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate disclosure in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hypotheses based on agency theory and organisational power literature are developed and tested on 85 firms listed in Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock exchanges. The study also runs multiple regression tests on two sub-samples (46 financial firms and 39 non-financial firms) in order to provide a richer analysis for the empirical findings. Overall, the results show that the extent of firms' disclosure is positively associated with the number of board committees, debt finance, firm size and firm profitability, while it is negatively related to CEO power. This study's findings direct policymakers attention to the importance of: the composition of the board, the optimal size of the board, governing the type of knowledge required for board members, and revisiting the level of foreign ownership in UAE firms.

Compensation not only provides incentives to an existing manager but also affects the type of manager attracted to the firm. This paper examines the dual incentive and sorting effects of performance pay in a simple contracting model of endogenous participation. Unless the manager is highly risk averse, sorting dampens optimal pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) because PPS beyond a nominal amount transfers unnecessary (information) rent to the manager. This helps explain why empirical estimates of PPS are much lower than predictions from models of moral hazard alone. The model also predicts that sorting under asymmetric information causes the firm to turn away more candidates than would be efficient; PPS increases in the cost of hiring the manager and in the manager's outside option, but decreases in output risk, information risk, and managerial risk aversion; and the firm becomes more selective in hiring as either the manager's outside option, the cost of hiring, risk aversion, output risk, or information risk increases.

The purpose of this study is to examine the empirical relationship between insider ownership and firm performance. Based on resource dependence theory, this study argues that the positive convergence-of-interests effect and the negative entrenchment effect can coexist in various industrial settings. Fixed-effect panel data regression models are applied to a sample of 1,156 effective observations. To reflect the contextual role of resources, we defined industrial settings along with industrial complexity and firm scale dimensions. The empirical results supported our research hypotheses, showing that insider ownership exerts a positive effect on firm performance in a high-complexity and large-scale setting, but a negative effect in a low-complexity and smallscale setting. The results of this study imply that contextual fitness must be deliberately considered to determine effective regulations of corporate governance. In addition, this study contributes a new aspect to related discussion, which synthesizes conflicting theoretical arguments by introducing the contextual role of resources. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute.

This study examines how organizational form (corporate or franchised store) and local market characteristics (competition, size and risk of sanctions) influence retail stores' likelihood of selling alcohol to minors. Drawing on agency theory, we hypothesize that franchised stores are more likely than corporate stores to sell alcohol to minors. We also examine whether local market competition, risk of sanctions, and market size influence the relationship between franchising and alcohol sales to minors. We test the hypotheses with data collected by minors attempting to purchase alcohol in retail stores. The results offer partial support to the theoretical predictions and have implications for retail chains and regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Existing research suggests that internal and external corporate governance mechanisms substitute for one another to mitigate agency problems in bidding firms. This paper tests whether the interaction between these mechanisms is more complementary. Research Findings/Insights: While there is evidence for disciplinary responses to bids for unrelated targets involving strategic retrenchment and significant asset divestment, the influence of the information conveyed by this characteristic on the likelihood of post-abandonment discipline is not amplified when boards are less independent. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results suggest that certain characteristics are used to distinguish between abandoned bidders which require discipline and those that do not. However, our findings do not suggest that interaction between internal and external governance mechanisms is contingent on board independence. Instead, these interactions between shareholders and boards seem to be contingent on a range of company, industry, and situation-specific factors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: While policy in the UK has focused on board independence as a means of effective corporate governance, our results suggest that this is not a panacea. Effective governance involves active owners, communicating their interests to boards, and boards responding accordingly. Further encouragement of such communication before, during, and after acquisitions will improve signals to managers that shareholders can target the necessary discipline of those whom they perceive to need it most.

This paper investigates if there is a relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance in selected firms listed on the JSE, and if so, what that relationship is. The study conducts regression analyses over a sample of 23 retail sector firms, observing data stretching from 2010 to 2013. The results are found to be robust. The results suggest that the hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between managerial ownership and performance be rejected as a negative relationship is found. Instead, the results of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis find that managerial ownership does not impact firm performance in any direction. Overall the results of the study do not support the agency theory, as aligning the interests of managers and shareholders does not improve firm performance, at least within the retail sector.

The impact of family ownership on strategic decision-making and diversifi cation in public corporations is an important but not clearly understood aspect of modern corporate governance. In many cases, large-block family owners of public corporations may have a great deal of input in strategic decision-making in large corporations. Previous literature investigates how ownership structure and diversifi cation are connected, but conclusions are not homogeneous. Agency theory suggests that professional managers are fundamentally self-interested, and the public corporation diversifi es because managers pursue their own interests, rather than the interest of shareholders. However in family fi rms, ownership and control use to coincide and family diversifi cation decisions which causes a lower diversifi cation. In this paper authors analyzes the impact of ownership concentration and the infl uence of ultimate owner's nature of business group (family or non-family) in diversifi cation's decision: specialization, related diversifi cation, unrelated diversifi cation and mixed diversifi cation (when a company uses both related and unrelated diversifi cation) Based on a sample of ninety-nine Spanish listed companies during the years 2000-2005, and using the listed company an their subsidiaries (pyramidal group) as unit of analysis, this research fi nds: fi rstly, the highest ownership concentration increases the adoption of specialization strategies and reduce the mixed diversifi cation; Secondly, attending to ultimate owner's nature, family fi rms adopt more strategies of specialization and related diversifi cation, and less diversifi cation strategies than nonfamily fi rms; Finally, results also show behaviour differences in family fi rms according to ownership concentration's degree: an increasing ownership concentration's degree in family fi rms rises the probability of diversifi cation.

The Shariah law makes Amanah (trustworthiness) a fundamental obligation for all the contractual parties. From the agency theory perspective, we, thus, investigate managerial trustworthiness in capital structure decisions of Shariah firms and compare it with those of Non-Shariah firms, in the light of Islamic principle of Amanah (trustworthiness). Specifically, we examine whether capital structure of Shariah firms is partially influenced by managerial ownership under the motivation of self-interest. Using the data from Pakistan, our results show that, unlike Non-Shariah firms, leverage ratios in Shariah firms are insensitive to the varying degree of managerial ownership, indicating absence of managerial opportunism in financial decisions of these firms. For the Non-Shariah firms, on the other hand, our results confirm findings of previous research which reveal that managers manipulate leverage ratios in their own interestat the cost of firm value, indicating the severity of agency conflicts among these firms. Invoking agency theory, we argue that certain firm characteristics (such as lower free cash-flows and lesser liquidity), achieved through Shariah compliance, help Shariah firms mitigate agency conflicts. These features persuade managers to behave less opportunistically than their counterparts in Non-Shariah firms as shown from their financing choices. The results are important for understanding nature of the two types of firms studied and the cross-sectional differences between the capital structure choices of these firms. Besides, our findings have also implications for growing number of Shariah compliant firms and a new clientele of Islamic investors who have entered capital markets due to the Islamic image of Shariah firms in Muslim majority country like Pakistan.

This paper explores whether the performance of publicly-listed family-controlled firms in Malaysia is related to the extent of the families' ownership. It also explores whether there are any moderating effects from the various attributes of board independence on the ownership-performance relationship of these firms. The findings indicate that increasing families' ownership is related to better firm performance under the condition that the families do not have absolute ownership and control over their firms. However, giving more control via majority ownership that causes the families to become the only dominant party might enhance their ability to expropriate and cause firm performance to deteriorate. Therefore, proposal to increase ownership as a mean to reduce the classical agency-theory problems should be caveated under the principal-principal perspective. It is also found that the various board independence attributes do not exhibit any moderating influence on the family ownership-firm performance relationship. This finding may indicate the powerlessness of the boards of director in Malaysia when encountered with the influential controlling families whom the directorship tenures and opportunities of the non-family directors depend on. Decisions made by the controlling families which have bearing on firm performance may not have been effectively counter checked by the boards due to the lack of truly independent nature of the boards.

The purpose of this general review is to enhance understanding of the importance of a corporation's whole ethics of governance regime and the connection to governance practices. This connection is often missing from corporate governance discussion. There is need for better business community awareness of a well-developed ethics of governance regime guiding appropriate board structure and composition choices subject to firm age and size, understanding of how these choices evolve as the firm matures and grows, plus the benefits from more emphasis in this area for company director training and development. This paper synthesises the theoretical and empirical insight from the ethics and corporate governance literatures to give guidance on best practice for large, medium size and small stock exchange listed companies. This synthesis of the literature evidences that the preferred Australian Institute of Company Directors agency theory prescription for a corporate board is not always optimal. In terms of practical implications advice is given on sound choices on board composition, director selection, plus director training and development that will give the best probability of effective board decisions and strong firm performance - this is not 'one size fits all' corporations advice. Future research should focus on whole ethics of governance regimes and governance practices in place for companies that have succeeded compared with companies that have failed. This will improve understanding in this area. This is a substantial future research agenda item as deeper knowledge of this contrast may add significantly to understanding of corporate success and failure.

This study highlights differences across Islamic and conventional banks, with a particular focus on the determinants of their capital structure. Islamic finance surely forbids debt-based funding but it is an open question whether Islamic banks prefer internal funds or external resources. The study provides empirical support for the fact that Islamic banks, in contrast to their conventional peers, rely more on their own equity rather than on external finance including loss-profit-sharing deposits. The analysis also puts in evidence that Islamic and conventional banks can be differentiated on the basis of assets tangibility and dividend payout and not in terms of profitability, asset liquidity and credit default. Among these factors, only profitability and size influence the equity-to-asset ratio in both kinds of banks. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines multi-year dynamic response of CEO compensation to firm performance. Multi-period agency theories posit that the CEO's current performance can be compensated both today and tomorrow. This study investigates the dynamic view of CEO pay and firm performance by using partial adjustment models of CEO pay. We find that target pay levels are set on "long-run" past firm performance and that the deviation of the actual pay level causes near-complete convergence to the target in one year. Overall, the findings here indicate that a pay-for-contemporaneous-only-performance relationship significantly understates the incentive effects of CEO pay. (c) by author(s).

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate whether firm-level corporate governance has an influence on the equity financing patterns in an emerging economy such as Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - The regression framework uses a questionnaire survey-based corporate governance index (CGI) comprising five dimensions - ownership structures, shareholder rights, independence and responsibilities of the board and management, financial reporting and disclosures and responsibility towards stakeholders. In addition, a number of semi-structured interviews have been carried out with the relevant stakeholders. Findings - The results suggest a statistically significant positive relationship between CGI and equity capital and, thus, confirm the prediction of the agency theory. Research limitations/implications - This study does not address endogeneity and reverse causality issues with respect to the relationship between CGI and equity finance. Practical implications - Firms should improve their legal compliance and voluntary activism in corporate governance matters to ensure increased access to equity finance. Originality/value - This study is among the first to examine the relationship between overall corporate governance quality and equity finance of a firm from the perspective of a bank-based emerging economy.

The systemic banking crisis in 2008 led to the quasi-nationalisation of two UK listed banks: The Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group (National Audit Office, 2010). Using property rights and agency theory as the theoretical frameworks, this paper analyses whether the quasi-nationalisation of these banks has been successful. It is argued that as a rescue mechanism, quasi-nationalisation was a positive development. However, questions arise over its effect as an instrument of banking reform. The State's arm's length approach to management represents a lost opportunity to change the culture of profitability over people that contributed to the banking crisis.

Management buyout (MBO) is a specialized form of acquisition with different motives. Sometimes, there are initiatives taken by the senior management to bailout the firm from sickness. The predominant agency theory focuses only on the governance issues in the MBO firms and this theory can be applied to understand how managerial discretion can play vital roles in mitigating value destruction in the post-MBO firm. A CEOled MBO is presumed to be greed-driven (Bebchuk, L., Cremers, M. Peyer, U. (2011). The CEO pay slice. Journal of Financial Economics, 102, 199SOH221.). But a senior management team-led MBO is said to be a socialistic move. By default, MBOs are debt-driven, unless the buying management team is financially affluent, which may be rare, considering the price for the buyout. Private equity (PE) players play a dominant role in providing and or arranging funds in the form of equity and or debt. There is a notion that the PE investors help promote entrepreneurial and modern management practices. The MBO target firm has to ensure returning the entire money back to the sponsors within the shortest possible time out of the operational cash flow. Therefore, various issues like identifying a target firm, sourcing mix of finance, MBO price determination, value creation and value delivery to all stakeholders are all important for understanding the subject. This chapter attempts to construct a robust model for structuring MBO to ensure value fairness to all parties involved in the transaction. (c) 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study seeks to furnish insights on institutional shareholders by assessing whether higher presence of institutional shareholders leads to higher dividend payout or vice versa in line with a particular version of the agency theory. The panel data consists of 100 Malaysian firms from the trading and services sector of Bursa Malaysia from the years 2005 to 2008. In line with the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis' theory of institutional shareholders and in conjunction with the outcome model of dividends, we find the presence of institutional shareholders results in higher dividends payout in Malaysia. In spite of the lower fraction of shareholding by institutional shareholders in Malaysia as compared to developed markets, it is clear from the results that the they in fact bring about a positive impact to the firms they invest in by resulting in higher dividends payments. We have provided a framework linking the two theories of dividends (outcome and substitute) and the three theories of institutional shareholders (efficient monitoring hypothesis, conflict of interest hypothesis and strategic alignment hypothesis) to better analyze the two broad ranging theories into greater depth.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore post-acquisition compensation management and examine how the two most commonly used theories to explain CEO stock option exercise, agency theory and CEO overconfidence, expect CEOs to manage their stock options following an acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Using logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate whether CEOs are more or less likely to exercise options following an acquisition, and the effect which CEO tenure and acquisition history may have on option exercise. Findings - The results suggest that CEOs are more likely to exercise options following an acquisition. The authors also find that CEO tenure and acquisition experience are both linked to an increase in option exercise. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that future research should expect agency effects to outweigh overconfidence effects when considering CEO stock option exercise behavior within the post-acquisition firm context. Practical implications - This paper advises directors and shareholders about whether agency concerns or overconfidence are of greater concern and how CEO tenure and past acquisition history may influence post-acquisition CEO stock option exercise behavior, offering information valuable in designing effective corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper is among the first to explore how CEOs manage their options following an acquisition and finds that CEOs are more likely to exercise stock options following an acquisition. Post-acquisition compensation management is an important, though overlooked, consideration in improving acquisition performance. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Although the agency theory has been widely used across a variety of corporate finance concepts for the past three decades, little work has been undertaken with regard to how the agency theory could be used to explain simultaneous interrelation among internal solutions for Agency problem. In addition, no general consensus has emerged after many years of investigation and scholars can often disagree about the same empirical evidence. Among other, potential endogeneity of the agency mechanisms, as well as cultural and structural differences between developed and developing markets, has been stated to cause the complexity of corporate governance around the world. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical literature addressing causal effects of managerial incentives and financial controlling instrument due to agency problem. At the same time, the article aims to improve the understanding of how these instruments affect each other. The main part of the discussion is related to the evaluation of theoretical aspects of internal Agency solution and their interrelations, as well as the experiential studies in different countries. As such, specification of Malaysian market is surveyed separately to highlight the need for multi-theoretic process and interrelation effects in future research on corporate agency problems in the Malaysian context.

The problem of managerial control and the concept of corporate governance have long been the subject of researches, often linked to widely known organizational theories (transaction cost theory, agency theory ...). But it seems that these analyzes, especially because they are too focused on relations with the shareholders and neglect the examination of "managerial discretion", can only incompletely account for the status and the actual behavior of top managers. The author proposes to follow various paths to overcome this situation by enriching the narrow approaches that are dominant today. (c) 2015, Lavoisier.

Purpose - This paper aims to assess the impact of the presence/absence of risk management practices on the risk of merger and acquisition (M&A) failure. Design/methodology/approach - An agency theoretic perspective is adopted, along with a mixed-methods approach to study managerial complexity beyond simply "good" and "bad". The focus is on an agency conflicts. Findings - The authors first present an integrated framework that classifies managerial behaviour and risk management, where M&A bids can become vehicles for maximising managerial benefits rather than shareholder value. The authors proceed to consider M&A activity that benefits both managers and shareholders in the presence of risk management strategies. Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the benefits of multiple paradigms and research paths that address dimensions captured by an agency theoretic perspective. Practical implications - The authors regard this paper as having particular significance in that the global financial crisis has impactedM&Aactivities and objectives, shifting the employment and related risks faced by managers. Originality/value - The paper suggests future research paths to advance the understanding of the complex behaviour of managers involved inM&Aactivities that go beyond the classification of "good" and "bad" managers.

This paper tries to answer the question of top management, public policy makers, researchers and scholars of how important the role of Corporate Governance (CG) and best practices are. Although there are plenty of previous researches, we find it necessary to conduct this study because we believe the outcome will be significant to Bolivia's corporate governance and best practices in order to support and validate the application of the CG's code as management strategy. Likewise, the lack of academic research about this subject in a developing country where these kinds of practices are just starting to be promoted is an important fact, enlightening firms to consider this public policy in order to be more competitive and efficient. We use Pearson's correlations analysis in contrast with multiple regression analysis to examine the significance of Board of directors' characteristics on financial performance ratios and the influence on firm value.

The study investigates the impact of agency problem and the distribution of corporate control on board composition using a dataset consisting of 190 listed firms in Indonesia. The conceptual framework is derived from agency theory assuming that board composition is endogenously determined by firm's specific environment. The study reveals that corporate control drives the composition of the board. The different types of large shareholders are found to pursue different strategies in relation to the board composition. While domestic and foreign investors rely on independent board, controlling family prefer to structure a less independent board. This suggests that the battle for corporate control between controlling family, in one side, and unrelated domestic and foreign investors begins with the structure of board. The findings imply that the type of large shareholder does matter in determining the device of corporate control. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

This paper argues that a primary reason for the mixed results observed in the corporate governance and firm performance literature is that the relevant theories have not been applied to the class of phenomena they were designed to explain. For instance, the literature that focuses on ownership structure and firm performance employs entrepreneurial agency theories of the firm but applies them to managerial firms where ownership is separated from control. This is evidenced by the fact that firms in which managerial ownership is close to zero percent are included in the samples. After similarly analyzing other related governance and performance literatures, the paper provides orientation and recommendations for researchers to avoid the identified problems and secure future progress.

Managerial risk taking has increasingly been highlighted as a prerequisite for innovation. Since innovation is viewed as a high-risk, high-cost endeavour, CEOs often are reluctant to become advocates for innovation. However, not much is understood in terms of managerial risk-taking behaviour in relation to innovation within strong vs. flexible governance settings at the level of the firm. In an attempt to fill this void, the current paper attempts to contextualize managerial risk taking behaviours within corporate governance environments and its interaction with the innovation generation activities of the firm. In the context of innovation, corporate governance would relate to exercising control over resource allocation, as well as the nature of an innovative investment strategy while relying on the incentives and abilities of individuals who exercise that control. While both internal and external corporate governance mechanisms serve to enhance firm innovation activity, in environments where such mechanisms are mandated then one can expect greater managerial risk-aversion towards innovation. In such a scenario there is in due course a trade-off on the time and resources that could be allocated towards innovation generation. In order to arrive at a theory of the innovative enterprise given certain corporate governance environments, future studies should go beyond the counting of R&D and patent statistics. Undertaking a holistic approach in understanding the role that corporate governance would play on firm innovation generation activities would enable adoption of policies that promotes managerial risk taking and subsequently innovation generation.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of family character on the level and type of diversification,additionally considering the effect of ownership concentration that exists in family business. The studyuses a sample of 99 listed companies, parent companies of business groups, with business group beingconsidered as the unit of analysis (parent company and subsidiaries firms). The results show that familygroups have lower average levels of total diversification and unrelated diversification, and they showthe negative influence of family character in unrelated diversification level. The existence of a nonlinearU-shaped relationship between the level of diversification (total and unrelated) and the ownership con-centration in family group is also observed, thus confirming a different behavior depending on the capitalheld by the main shareholders. The results obtained provide new evidence for the academic literatureon family firms and business groups, as well as on the diversification strategies adopted by the familygroups. (c) 2014 AEDEM.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study reviews previous country-level and firm-level studies on corporate governance codes up to 2014 in order to highlight recent trends and indicate future avenues of research. Research Findings/Results: Our data show that research on codes increases over time consistently with the diffusion and the relevance of the empirical phenomenon. Despite previous studies substantially enriching our knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of governance codes, our study shows there are still several opportunities to make significant contributions in this area. Theoretical Implications: Agency theory is the dominant theoretical framework, although other theoretical perspectives (especially the institutional one) are increasingly adopted. Future studies should be aimed at widening and combining various theoretical lenses so as to develop new interpretations and a better understanding of governance codes.

This paper investigates the relationship between divestitures and firm value in family firms. Using hand-collected data on a sample of over 30,000 firm-year observations, we find that family firms are less likely than non-family firms to undertake divestitures, especially when these companies are managed by family rather than non-family-CEOs. However, we then establish that the divestitures undertaken by family firms, predominantly those run by family-CEOs, are associated with higher post-divestiture performance than their non-family counterparts. These findings indicate that family firms may fail to fully exploit available economic opportunities, potentially because they pursue multiple objectives beyond the maximization of shareholder value. These results also elucidate how the characteristics of corporate owners and managers can influence the value that firms derive from their corporate strategies.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We examine the unique nature of agency problems within publicly traded family firms by investigating the earnings management decision of dominant family owners relative to non-family. To do so, we draw upon literature demonstrating that family owners are loss averse with respect to the family's socioemotional wealth, or the affective endowment derived from firm ownership and control. Our theory and findings suggest that potential reputational consequences of earnings management lead family principals to engage in less of this practice relative to non-family firms, and that founder family firms are less likely than non-founder family firms to use earnings management. Moreover, the family-firm effect varies with the firm size, the degree of CEO entrenchment, and the firm's stock structure. We provide important insights regarding differences between family and non-family principals in the use of unethical accounting practices, thereby extending agency theory and advancing an underdeveloped research area.

Agency theories predict that older firms make value-destroying acquisitions to benefit managers. Neoclassical theories predict instead that such firms make wealth-increasing acquisitions to exploit underutilized assets. Using IPO cohorts, we establish that, while younger firms make more related and diversifying acquisitions than mature firms, the acquisition rate follows a U-shape over firms' life cycle. Consistent with neoclassical theories, we show that acquiring firms have better performance and growth opportunities and create wealth through acquisitions of nonpublic firms throughout their life. Consistent with agency theories, older firms experience negative stock price reactions for acquisitions of public firms. (c) 2015 the American Finance Association.

In prior research which explores the relationship between organizational slack and corporate social performance (CSP) it is implicitly assumed that slack is homogeneous and positively affects CSP. In this study we build on recent research which argues that slack is heterogeneous and can be conceptualized as financial, human resources, and innovational in nature. We view the slack-CSP relationship from both organizational and agency theory perspectives. We propose that different slack conceptualizations and the contrary assumptions of aforementioned theories hold divergent implications for CSP. We test our hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of public corporations in the United States and confirm this divergent impact. Our results suggest that the relationship between organizational slack and CSP is more complex than previously understood. We discuss the implications of our findings for the slack-resource hypothesis of CSP. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study focuses on the role of Say-on-Pay as a mechanism that aims to promote the efficiency of corporate governance by providing an additional channel for the expression of shareholder "voice." Initially introduced in the UK, Say-on-Pay has subsequently been adopted in a large number of countries and it has recently received significant attention from regulators, media, and the general public. The purpose of this study is to review prior literature related to Say-on-Pay and its impact on firm value and corporate decision making. Research Findings/Insights: Our study highlights the interdisciplinary nature of research on Say-on-Pay. We also shed light on conceptual gaps and empirical discrepancies in prior studies, indicating that many questions linked to Say-on-Pay and its importance for the executive pay-setting process remain largely unanswered. Theoretical/Academic Implications: At a theoretical level, we highlight potential areas for development of the existing theoretical framework for Say-on-Pay, which is at present rather limited and primarily influenced by agency theory. At an empirical level, we propose a substantial number of avenues for fruitful future research on this topic. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In the light of recent proposals for extending the role of Say-on-Pay within the corporate governance framework, our findings are particularly relevant to regulators. More thought is needed about changing its nature from advisory to binding, as the degree of its effectiveness and the dynamics of the voting process are still unclear. Our study could also be informative for the media and the general public, especially given the increasing attention afforded to Say-on-Pay. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Because prior research has largely adopted an agency theory perspective and focused extensive effort on examining shareholder-centric corporate governance mechanisms and their outcomes for shareholders or select groups of stakeholders, relatively little work has focused on whether governance structures can maximize outcomes for all stakeholders. We adopt an integrated, stakeholder-agency theory perspective to explore a set of corporate governance mechanisms that potentially can help firms generate greater engagement with a broad array of stakeholders. We test the relationship between stakeholder-centric governance and corporate social performance using a sample of 342 firms in 24 countries over four years and find that certain corporate governance mechanisms can indeed be construed as 'stakeholder-centric' as they positively impact corporate social performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the audit committee (AC) independence, financial expertise, internal audit function, audit quality and ownership concentration on earnings quality (EQ) and, consequently, ascertain whether the AC's independence and financial expertise has a moderating effect on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample is 508 firms listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) for the years 2009 to 2012. EQ was measured using two modified Jones models of discretionary accruals. Findings: The findings reveal that the independence of AC and investment in internal audit function, as well as the Big4 audit firm, are related to greater EQ. Ownership concentration is found to be associated with lower EQ. The study provides evidence that AC's independence moderates the relationship between internal audit function (investment in and sourcing arrangements of internal audit function) and EQ. It also shows that AC's financial expertise moderates the relationship between sourcing arrangements of internal audit function and EQ. Practical implications: This study extends the prior related literature by examining the AC's independence and financial expertise as moderating variables on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Social implications: Policymakers might use the findings regarding EQ in relation to governance practices, to recognize the important roles played by the AC's independence and financial expertise on the effectiveness of internal audit function with EQ. Originality/value: This study uses the agency theory and resource dependence theory to provide empirical evidence on the impact of internal audit function and AC on EQ in the ownership concentration environment.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines the influence of managerial ownership on firm agency costs among listed firms in Bangladesh. This is an institutional setting that features a mixture of agency costs. This institutional setting has a concentration of ownership by managers, but the firms are not solely owned by managers. The extant literature suggests that the sacrifice of wealth by the principal and potential costs associated with monitoring the agents is known as the agency cost. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction', and the 'asset utilisation ratio'. The finding of the study is that managerial ownership reduces the firm agency cost only under the 'asset utilisation ratio' measure of agency cost; this is robust with regard to a number of robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the convergence of interest is evident with very high and low levels of managerial ownership. The entrenchment effect by the owners is evident at moderate levels of managerial ownership. Although there has been great scepticism among management researchers on the validity of agency theory, overall, the findings of this study do not reject the validity of agency theory. Given that the entrenchment by managers is evident at certain levels of ownership and that the agency problem may still exist between insiders and outsiders, legislative guidelines for controlling share ownership may be required.

This study examines the dividend policy behavior of Islamic and conventional banks operating in Arab markets. These banks operate in an environment of Sharia law and low levels of investor protection. Our results support the substitution agency model of dividends for Islamic banks, and Islamic banks use the dividend policy as a substitute mechanism for alleviating relatively more significant agency problems and higher risks of expropriation by insiders. In these markets, conventional banks operate in a more competitive environment and experience relatively less significant agency problems. In contrast to Islamic banks, conventional banks follow the outcome agency model of dividends. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the relationship between long-term orientation, family involvement in the top management team (TMT), and family firm performance. On the basis of agency and stewardship theory, we propose that the inclusion of family members in the TMT only enhances firm performance if it induces a long-term orientation among management. An empirical analysis involving 201 privately owned family firms from Germany supports our theory that a long-term orientation helps align family and organizational goals. As such, it represents an important mediator that links family involvement in the TMT to performance. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Prior work examining the antecedents of capital structure for small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets is limited. This paper sheds light on how the corporate governance mechanisms adopted by firms on the newly established Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in China influence their use of debt. We find that the financial leverage of GEM firms is positively influenced by executives' shareholding and their excess cash compensation. Ownership concentration appears to reduce leverage, whereas the percentage of tradable shares increases leverage. In contrast, institutional investors' shareholding does not influence the level of debt. Traditional factors such as tax and operating cash flow are insignificant in explaining the debt levels among GEM firms. (c) 2016, The Author(s).

Entrepreneurial universities are a catalyst for regional economic development and growth. Yet, the entrepreneurial university may not always capture the full gains made by the broader economy due to opportunistic behavior by its faculty scientists. We expand agency theory to address conditions when opportunistic behavior persists in the face of substantial information symmetry and where principals appear to tolerate opportunism despite the authority to sanction their agents. Using a sample of 105 US research universities and 73,603 scientists, we demonstrate that some scientists privately leak discoveries invented while working for their universities. Counter to prior prediction, we find that universities acting as principals often do not retaliate even when having knowledge of such opportunistic behavior and the capability to punish non-complying agents. To extend theory, we examined contexts that exacerbate and alleviate such overt opportunism: High-value discoveries and sizable entrepreneurial activity are associated with greater opportunistic behavior, whereas efforts to empower those who have close professional ties with scientists--their departments and technology commercialization offices--are related to reduced opportunism. To complement our empirical analyses, we provide a stylized mathematical model that shows how agency theory can improve its predictive power once it formally recognizes certain conditions under which agents wield substantial bargaining power over their principals, who in turn seem to tolerate agents' overt opportunistic behavior.

This paper examines whether and to what degree agency conflicts in ownership structure affect firm leverage ratios and external financing decisions, using a universal sample of UK firms from 1998 to 2012. We use two distinctive measures to capture ownership structure, namely, managerial share ownership (MSO) and institutional ownership. Our empirical results show a non-monotonic relation between MSO and the debt ratio, supporting two competing theories: interest alignment theory and the management entrenchment hypothesis. Nevertheless, institutional ownership is found to be positively related to firm leverage levels. Our results further suggest that firms with concentrated MSO decrease their leverage by increasing the probability of issuing equity over bonds, an effect strengthened during hot market periods.

Using an index of corporate governance quality (CGQ), we provide the first robust evidence of the determinants of stock liquidity in Australia. We assume that CGQ affects stock liquidity because effective governance decreases information asymmetries between insiders (e.g. managers) and outsiders (e.g. investors), as well as among outsiders, by improving information transparency of a firm. Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity. These findings are robust to alternative proxies of CGQ, stock liquidity and endogeneity bias. (c) 2016 Taylor & Francis.

Purpose: - This paper aimsto synthesize the extant researchon earnings management infamily firms. Design/methodology/approach: - The paper reviews the current state of knowledge about earnings management in family firms, identifying the main theoretical frameworks used in the empirical research on the topic, as well as the main types of said research and its findings. Findings: - Agency theory is identified as the main theoretical framework used. Two major types of research identified in the literature are discussed, namely, earnings management in family firms versus non-family firms and earnings management in different types of family frms. Originality/value: - Important research gaps are identifed, and future research priorities are suggested. These pertain to the lack of research on earnings management in different types of family firms, the utility of using qualitative and experimental research, as well as the importance of using theoretical frameworks better able to capture the peculiarities of family firms.

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance by companies listed on the Palestinian Stock Exchange. Accounting and market performance measures were used to proxy corporate performance. Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper addresses the effect of having multiple large shareholders on shareholder protection. More specifically, we examine to what extent this effect depends on whether such large shareholders are beneficiary or fiduciary. Research Findings/Insights: Analyzing longitudinal, hand-collected data covering Swiss listed companies, we find that having several large shareholders leads to overall higher shareholder protection (i.e. adoption of more formal corporate governance mechanisms). This is because large shareholders have an interest in putting more formal governance mechanisms in place when there is another large shareholder that might try to extract rents at the expense of others. Moreover, we find that this effect is driven by the presence of several beneficiary shareholders, i.e. shareholders that invest their own wealth in the company in contrast to dispersed ownership and fiduciary shareholders, i.e. shareholders acting on behalf of others. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Building on recent developments in agency theory, this paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically showing that potential "principal-principal" conflicts among large shareholders lead to overall better shareholder protection in terms of more formal governance mechanisms being adopted. This finding contrasts with situations in which there is only one large shareholder that does not have an interest in strengthening formal corporate governance. Our findings imply, however, that the characteristics of the large shareholders matter: Fiduciary shareholders in the Swiss setting are mostly passive buy-and-hold shareholders and therefore do not engage extensively in improving shareholder protection. Beneficiary shareholders, in contrast, directly intervene in the governance of the firm (i.e. governance by voice), so that in the presence of multiple beneficiary shareholders, more formal governance mechanisms help to monitor not only management but the other large shareholders as well. In addition, more formal governance mechanisms serve as a platform to coordinate their diverging objectives. Practitioner Implications: We demonstrate the influence of a second (or several) large beneficiary shareholder(s), on corporate governance and the benefit to all shareholders. In addition, we propose the strengthening of governance mechanisms as a platform to reconcile conflicting interests among prominent shareholders and contribute to the debate on the allocation of certain voting privileges to long-term shareholders.

This paper examines the role of commercial banks' governance mechanisms in financial performance and loan quality. The research draws upon corporate governance theory, agency theory, and information asymmetry. Fuzzy-set QCA was used to analyze a sample of 32 commercial banks listed in the UK. Data referred to the pre-crisis period. Results confirm that different combinations of governance mechanisms can yield similar financial performance and loan quality. This research contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among banking governance mechanisms, financial performance, and loan quality. The paper also has practical implications because it identifies alternative governance solutions for the commercial banking sector. (c) 2016, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Based on Upper Echelons Theory and Agency Theory, we explore the effect of CEOs' power through their tenure, board committee membership and other corporate governance factors on idiosyncratic volatility. Our study addresses the gap in the literature to find the direct link between the source of corporate governance practices and idiosyncratic volatility in stock price. We use a generalised method of moments in a panel analysis of Australian firms for 2004-2013 and a robust model that controls for firm size, firm age, trading volume, market-to-book ratio, dividend payout, the global financial crisis, product market competition and financial intermediaries. We find that CEOs who have stronger managerial power are associated with lower idiosyncratic volatility. This determining factor remains significant with the inclusion of widely-researched firm characteristics and external factors on idiosyncratic volatility in our robust analysis.

This study extends the family firm performance literature by focusing on birth order differences among descendant CEOs. Data collected from a sample of Korean family firms yield three insights. First, descendant birth order is directly associated with differences in the distribution of control through ownership, leadership (i.e., CEO), and the incorporation of outside board participation and governance. Second, descendant birth order also moderates the relationship between outside block holdings and firm performance. Third, we find evidence suggesting that because of firm performance differences, first-son descendant CEOs may find themselves more often replaced over time. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study makes use of a large multi-country sample to examine how the market performance of family firms is affected by national context. Research Findings/Insights: We find that Tobin's Q among family firms is significantly lower than that of non-family firms across 33 countries. In examining these effects, results suggest that legal context and national culture influence the performance implications of publicly traded family firms, serving to mitigate some of the generally negative impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We find that national context is an important contingency in determining the family's ability and willingness to exploit minority shareholder wealth. Building upon our results, future research can focus on how formal and informal institutions may be substitutes for each other. Our results help explain why prior empirical research provides conflicting results regarding the impact of family governance on firm valuation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that the performance implications of family firms are contingent on legal protections, belief in the impartiality of the legal system, and culture. Given wide variations in these measures across countries, the appropriate mechanisms to strengthen investor protection will not follow a one-size fits all approach. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

The ownership structure of Chinese firms has experienced significant changes over the last three decades, including the development of a fast growing stock market through which a large number of domestic firms have become publicly traded corporations. These changes have drawn increasing attention from researchers of corporate governance. In this article, we review the empirical research on corporate governance in China, with a focus on the internal and external governance mechanisms that have been investigated and the findings about the effectiveness of these mechanisms. On the basis of our review of 132 studies, we summarize the major findings and discuss the limitation of agency theory in understanding the governance issue in Chinese firms. We offer several ideas (e.g., the importance of the social context, new conceptualization of governance, different outcomes of governance, and data/method issues) for a new agenda to guide future research in the corporate governance of firms operating in the Chinese and other emerging economy contexts.

This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by examining relations between family involvement and CEO compensation. Using a panel of 362 small U.S. listed firms, we analyze how founding families influence firm performance through option portfolio price sensitivity. Consistent with the dual agency framework, we find that family firms have lower CEO incentive pay, which is further reduced by higher executive ownership. Interestingly, such incentive pay offsets the positive impact that families have on firm valuation. Collectively, our results show that, compared with nonfamily firms, lower incentive pay adopted by family firms due to lower agency costs mitigates the direct effect of family involvement on firm performance. Once accounting for CEO incentive pay, we do not observe performance differences between family and nonfamily firms. (c) 2016 International Council for Small Business

Recent studies have criticized MBA programs for their association with self-serving behavior, although there is little empirical research to establish the firm-level consequences of that relationship. We explored whether MBAs versus non-MBAs in a sample of celebrated CEOs of major U.S. companies--thus CEOs who have achieved and had opportunity to exploit their fame--were more apt than their counterparts to engage in self-serving behavior that benefits them but disadvantages their companies. We assessed this behavior via the pursuit of costly growth strategies, an inability to sustain performance, and the capacity to obtain superior private benefits in compensation. Our analysis of 444 star CEOs celebrated on the covers of major business publications confirmed that an MBA education either fosters or is related to such behavior among these executives.

Recent analyses of U.S. public family firms (PFFs) show that family firms outperform other forms of organization. However, scholars call for more studies to determine why PFFs outperform the market. High performance work systems (HPWSs) reflect the extent to which an organization adopts and implements a strategic approach in HRM practices and could be why PFFs outperform. Using the stewardship perspective, agency theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, this study empirically examines the relationship among family governance oversight, HPWS, and performance at PFFs. Using a sample of 159 Taiwanese public firms, the empirical results indicate that independent directors on the board and the level of family member board participation associate with HPWS adoption.

This study investigates the association between investment decisions and financial reporting quality in the context of family firms versus non-family firms. Building on the classic agency theory and the behavioral agency theory, we argue that financial reporting quality may play a different role on investment decisions for family and non-family firms. We address our research question by using a sample of listed firms in Taiwan from 1996 to 2011. Consistent with the behavioral agency theory, our findings suggest that family firms are more likely to under-invest than non-family firms in order to protect their socioemotional wealth, and financial reporting quality is more negatively associated with family firms' under-investment behavior. The existence of internal financing channels attenuates this negative association. However, this study does not find a significant role on such association when a family member serves as the chief executive officer. These results are robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity issue of financial reporting quality, alternate measures of inefficient investment as well as internal financing channels, family firm subsample, and different industry groups. This study contributes to the literature on the relation between financial reporting quality and investment decisions by highlighting the unique characteristics of family firms.

With the aim of achieving an advanced understanding of current research on unrelated diversification and providing fruitful groundwork to foster active interchange between disciplinary traditions, this paper detects articles from two relevant research streams; i.e., strategic management and financial economics. We first provide a brief overview of management thinking on unrelated diversification strategy. Then, we present a conceptual map that offers a comprehensive appreciation of unrelated diversification strategy antecedents (i.e., environmental and institutional, organizational value-enhancing, and managerial drivers), implementation process (i.e., managerial complexity, misallocation of resources, and structural inertia), and consequences (i.e., diversification premiums and discounts). Finally, we unpack the major gaps in our current knowledge that may help refocus the research agenda on unrelated diversification strategy and revamp the apparent waning proclivity of this issue.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between ownership structure and indebtedness for a sample of 2,544 Spanish small and medium enterprises. A System Generalized Method of Moments methodology is applied to control for the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The finding shows a negative effect of several measures of ownership on debt ratio. Therefore, the presence of an individual as main shareholder has a positive effect on debt, while the presence of a corporation as main shareholder exerts a negative influence. As research implications, this paper includes the agency problem based on principal-principal conflicts to explain the capital structure of small and medium enterprises, going beyond traditional principal-agent conflicts. The main practical implications of the paper is that owners who seek equity financing can use the results of this study for understanding better why investors are reluctant to invest in their small and medium enterprises. Policymakers can use the results of this study to develop better policies and to promote better provision of information for all stakeholders. About the contribution of this study, we are not aware of any paper that uses a panel of small and medium enterprises operating in a French-civil law country to examine the relationship between indebtedness and three different proxies of the ownership structure.

While privatization has long been a central pro-market strategy for promoting competitiveness, little is known about which aspects of this multilevel process impact firm performance. Agency theory predicts that privatization will improve firm performance due to changes in monitoring by shareholders, the incentives of management, and the political control of the government. Measuring how each of these three pathways impact firm performance separately is difficult, however, as most privatizations result in the transfer of both ownership and control to private investors, influencing several of these pathways at once. This article is able to circumvent this limitation by examining changes to firm performance from the minority privatization of Indonesian state-owned firms during whic\h firms experience only changes in monitoring, as majority state ownership and control remain the same. Difference-in-differences analyses suggest that changes to monitoring improve firm performance by 9-13%, controlling for cross-sectional, time-invariant, and time-varying firm characteristics, macroeconomic issues affecting all firms, selection issues, and considering several alternative hypotheses. Altogether, this article suggests that firm performance via privatization can improve through changes to monitoring alone, without implementing the costly organizational changes required by complete privatization or requiring that the state relinquish control of socially important firms.

This paper considers the potential role played by different kinds of shareholders in a firm's international level, distinguishing the firms quoted in the UK from those listed in the countries of Continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain). Our results confirm that different kinds of ownership affect the overall level of a firm's internationalisation. Family ownership has a negative impact on foreign sales in the UK but not in Continental Europe, while bank ownership has a negative impact on the scope of FDI in Continental Europe but no impact whatsoever in the UK. Institutional investors positively impact the scope of both foreign sales and FDI in the UK, while in Continental Europe they have a negative impact on foreign sales. These different results contribute to explaining why previous studies that have focused on just one country or a single measurement of internationalisation have come up with such contrasting results.

Private firms adopt Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices voluntarily. Using results of a survey that involved 78 respondents, we investigate the adoption of ERM practices in Italian private corporations and question whether ERM adoption is affected by the ownership structure of the firm. We find that agency conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders, which arise when ownership dispersion decreases, affect ERM adoption, and that when proprietorship is more dispersed, the firm places more focus on ERM projects. Additionally, we document the different roles of different types of owners. More specifically, in line with the patronage agency theory, the government-controlled enterprises undergo more intense ERM, whereas, in line with behavioral agency theory, individual and family-controlled firms pay less attention to ERM adoption.

This paper investigates whether auditors' client acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor in family firms are significantly different from those in non-family firms. Relying on the auditing literature (client acceptance and audit pricing) and using insights from the agency theory, we document that successor auditors incorporate a firm's ownership structure into their acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor. Big 4 auditors are more likely to serve as successor auditors following auditor resignations in family firms as opposed to non-family firms. The changes in audit fees following auditor resignations in family firms, however, are significantly smaller than those in non-family firms. These results hold when we account for whether a family firm is managed by a founder, a descendant, or by a professional manager, and when we use the percentage of shares held by the family members as another proxy for family ownership. Additional analysis further demonstrates that the likelihood of financial restatements in family firms in the post-resignation period are significantly lower than those in non-family firms. Overall, our findings suggest that Big 4 auditors perceive family firms from which the incumbent auditors resigned as being less risky than their non-family counterparts.

Blockholders impact strategic firm decisions because they are better at monitoring managers than dispersed shareholder groups. Nevertheless, we do not sufficiently understand how preferences of different blockholder types impact strategic firm decisions. We discuss this in the context of takeover premiums offered for publicly listed firms. Prior studies have argued that managers are often tempted to offer excessively high premiums. Consistently, blockholders might better control managers and ensure lower premiums. To better understand the impact of blockholder preferences, we focus on the special case of family firms. Specifically, drawing on the behavioral agency model, we hypothesize that bidders with family blockholders offer lower premiums than bidders with other blockholders or bidders without blockholders. Our empirical results support our hypotheses based on a sample of 149 takeover offers. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

The study analyzes the characteristics that motivate the voluntary disclosure on intangible representing organizational structural capital of the banking organizations registered on stock exchanges: Brazil and Spain. Traditional accounting is not approaching the real value of the organizations, obtained by its intangible capital. To mitigate the marked difference between the book value and the market price of these organizations, the trend to voluntary disclosures on their intangible resources has emerged. The asymmetry of information, resulting from not accounting for the organizational structural resources is studied by 2 theoretical perspectives. Agency theory suggests that the voluntary disclosure of information reduces agency costs. The theory of the cost of the owner assumes that reveal information generates additional costs, as well as the possibility of loss of its competitive advantages. This research examines 174 annual reports of 29 banks, from 2006 to 2011. The technique of multiple linear regressions using the method of least squares with panel data was used. The test results confirm the hypothesis that large banks, the most profitable and the oldest are more motivated to voluntarily disclose information representing organizational structural capital.

In 2003, a new UK corporate governance Code recommended that the CEO should not become chairman of the same firm. The UK regulator, adopting an agency theory perspective, argued that this prevents powerful CEOs from clinging to power, to the detriment of firm performance. An alternative viewpoint, offered by stewardship theory, proposes that managers are inherently motivated to act in the best interests of the company and such controls are unnecessary, bringing no benefits to shareholders. This study therefore asks: (i) Does allowing the CEO to remain as chair damage firm performance? (ii) Did the changes to recommended best practice affect the number of CEOs remaining as chairman? (iii) Did the Combined Code (2003) affect the use of relay-style succession in the UK? Analysing a sample of 225 CEO routine departure events from 1996 to 2007 produces the answers: (i) this practice caused no apparent harm to accounting or stock market performance; (ii) there was a significant reduction in the practice in the period following the reform; and (iii) while UK firms were employing relay-style succession practices prior to the reforms, this has since abated. Overall, the evidence fails to support the agency view adopted by UK regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

This study assesses the link between nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee and gender diversity in Ghanaian boardrooms. We use a dataset of 25 listed and 20 unlisted Ghanaian firms for January 2006 to December 2012; nine years after the Ghana Government endorsed an Affirmative Action Plan to achieve 40% representation of women on all boards by the year 2000. We employ probit and logit regressions to test our hypotheses. Listed firms and financial institutions are more likely to have more gender diverse boards. By contrast, we have no evidence to support the link between board gender diversity and board size, firm age, firm size, firm ownership, board composition and nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee. Overall, our results raise questions on the appropriateness of the continual use of both the agency and resource dependency theories in explaining board gender diversity in developing economies' perspective. This study is the first of its kind, particularly within developing economies. (c) Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study attempts to investigate the effect of the ownership structure characteristics (ownership concentration, managerial ownership and government ownership) on firm performance (ROA) among non-financial Omani companies during 2012-2014. For achieving the objective of this study, 81 firms were taken as a sample to test the above relations. The sampling was obtained from annual report of the companies for three years with a total sampling equal to 243 firms. Multiple regression analysis was employed to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. In addition, this study tried to fill the gap in the existing literature concerning the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the developing countries such as Oman. This study found a positive and significant association between ownership concentration and government ownership to firm performance (ROA). The study provides some suggestions for future researchers before the conclusion. (c) 2016, Virtus interpress. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the possible trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. The issue was addressed through examining the effect of compliance with the corporate governance code (CGC) on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on cross-sectional survey and content analysis of annual reports, the level of CE and compliance with the CGC were measured in the large and medium-listed companies in the UK during 2010. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Findings: The results suggest no conflict between compliance with the CGC and CE in the UK, which can be attributed to the flexibility of the "comply or explain" approach. This implies that no trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. Practical implications: The study provides evidence in support of the regulatory governance framework in the UK and the comply or explain approach at large. This evidence contributes to the debate on the rules-based or principles-based governance, which may affect future CG regulations. It can also guide the directors to achieve the balance between their conformance and performance roles. Originality/value: The study bridges the gap between CG and CE disciplines through developing a theoretical model that integrate contingency and agency theories lenses. Adopting a holistic approach provides insights into the relationships between CG and CE, rather than investigating the effect of each of these practices separately on organisational performance.

Purpose: We take a state-stewardship view on corporate governance and executive compensation in economies with strong political involvement, where state-appointed managers act as responsible "stewards" rather than "agents" of the state. Methodology/approach: We test this view on China and find that Chinese managers are remunerated not for maximizing equity value but for increasing the value of state-owned assets. Findings: Managerial compensation depends on political connections and prestige, and on the firms' contribution to political goals. These effects were attenuated since the market-oriented governance reform. Research limitations/implications: Economic reform without reforming the human resources policies at the executive level enables the autocratic state to exert political power on corporate decision making, so as to ensure that firms' business activities fulfill the state's political objectives. Practical implications: As a powerful social elite, the state-steward managers in China have the same interests as the state (the government), namely extracting rents that should adhere to the nation (which stands for the society at large or the collective private citizens). Social implications: As China has been a communist country with a single ruling party for decades, the ideas of socialism still have a strong impact on how companies are run. The legitimacy of the elite's privileged rights over private sectors is central to our question. Originality/value: Chinese executive compensation stimulates not only the maximization of shareholder value but also the preservation of the state's interests.

Our study is motivated by economic theory and the debate among practitioners, standard setters, and academics on the role of conditional conservatism in financial reporting. We find that managers provide less conditionally conservative financial reports after their firms are added to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 index. S&P 500 membership is expected to reduce information asymmetry between managers and outside stakeholders due to an increased flow of public and private information. As a result, the contracting benefits of conservative accounting choices are reduced, and managers are less willing to provide conditionally conservative reports. In contrast, we find that managers provide more conditionally conservative financial reports after their firms are deleted from the index. Firms being deleted from the S&P 500 index probably incur an increase in information asymmetry. Overall, our results provide evidence consistent with conditional conservatism being a response by managers to the information needs of financial statements users. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

Stock options (hereafter SOs) have been extensively investigated by the literature. The debate has been mainly grounded in the agency theory that has interpreted these tools as mechanisms to align the conflicting interests of managers and owners towards the shareholder value maximization. However, the latest empirical evidence suggests that SOs are often used by opportunistic managers to extract rents to the detriment of shareholders. In addition, literature identifies the perceived cost as a further theoretical lens to interpret the use of SOs. Despite the growing interest around the topic, the research is still fragmented and fails to present a comprehensive picture on the factors that affect the aim of SOs. Our literature review attempts to fill this gap by providing a systematization of the studies on the topic. The paper concludes by presenting the theoretical and practical implications of the study and suggesting directions for future research. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this article is to examine the Intellectual Capital (IC) disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives (agency, signalling and proprietary costs theories). According to the agency theory, the failure of traditional financial statements to report the 'soft assets' would lead knowledge-intensive firms (where the components of IC are structurally higher) to provide a higher level of disclosure in order to reduce the greater information asymmetries with external firm agents. However, because of the highly proprietary nature of IC information (proprietary costs theory) as well as the relevance of IC information to externally signal the key sources of superior quality of a company (signalling theory), different IC disclosure strategies may be adopted by managers of intellectual-capital-rich firms, depending on the particular motivations associated with firm-specific characteristics of these companies. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework under examination (if any) is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of high-tech companies. To this end, we deduce, and test, a set of hypotheses in accordance with the theoretical frameworks considered. The study also takes into account the effects of changes in the governmental regulation concerning non-financial information that occurred during the period examined. The empirical analysis is conducted on all Italian high-tech listed companies and based on longitudinal data (of 5 years: 2007-2011). By using longitudinal data and the population of all of the high-tech Italian companies, the analysis overcomes the well-known limitations of the sampling and the cross-sectional data that provide snapshot results. The findings reveal that the companies' disclosure strategy primarily depends on the specific category of the IC information. In particular, the results suggest that the proprietary costs theory prevails in explaining the companies' disclosure behaviour on internal IC information. The signalling theory prevails in the explanation of the communication strategies about external IC most likely to enhance investors' confidence in the intangible key value drivers relating to relational capital. Finally, for companies examined, higher levels of ownership diffusion represent the primary incentive to disclose human capital information to reduce agency/monitoring costs (in presence of higher leverage) or signal to the market the superior quality (in presence of higher profitability). This article extends the existing empirical literature on IC disclosure behaviour in high-tech industries by analysing the disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost theory. In addition, the comprehensive regression model (with specific two-way interaction terms) used in this study expands on the extant approaches for the analysis of IC disclosure determinants allowing to capture some aspects that could be omitted when only the explanation variables taken separately are considered. This study has practical implications for various parties, such as regulators. It provides empirical evidence for the primary limits (relating to the proprietary costs) to an introduction of mandatory law requirements regarding the information on internal structure of IC. In particular, our findings prove that companies exposed to the threat of competitive disadvantages prefer not to provide - by formal channels, such as annual reports - additional internal IC information.

This paper investigates the influence of firm-level corporate governance on financial performance of the listed firms in Bangladesh. Agency theory suggests that better corporate governance reduces expropriation costs, which, in turn, enhances investors' confidence in the firm's future cash flow and growth prospects, leading to higher firm valuation. Likewise, a decrease in private benefits is likely to cause an improved operating performance. This paper uses a questionnaire survey-based corporate governance index (CGI), comprising of the three dimensions - shareholder rights, independence and responsibilities of the board and management, and financial reporting and disclosures. The study results partly confirm the prediction of the agency theory, with a statistically significant positive relationship between a firm's corporate governance quality and its valuation, even though the relationship between firm level corporate governance and operating performance seems inconclusive.

This chapter investigates the influence of the board composition and leadership on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosure. The empirical study of 68 Tunisian listed companies and 100 Egyptian listed companies reveals that board independence, foreign directorship, female directorship and state directorship, influence positively CSR disclosure. However, these findings indicate that CEO duality has a negative impact on CSR disclosure. Overall, the findings are consistent with the agency theory as well as the stakeholders theory and suggest that CSR disclosure seems to result from the willingness to meet shareholders' expectations in terms of transparency and voluntary disclosure of non-financial information.

We examine stock price reactions to minority block purchases in German target companies. Our results document that the formation of new outside blocks leads to significant value creation for target shareholders, the size of the effect depending on the identity of the block acquirer. As blocks by strategic investors or activist sponsors entail significantly higher returns compared to pure financial block acquirers this result can be ascribed to a differentiated support of the monitoring hypothesis of agency theory. We also find a negative relation between target firms' growth before the acquisition and the value generation by new block owners. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to provide an overview of the trend or focus in the research of corporate governance in emerging countries with the aim to identify the gaps in the existing literature. The review notes that corporate governance research in emerging countries is dominated by economic perspective,in particular the agency theory,as researchers follow the strands of research conducted in the more advanced countries,especially the US and the UK. This paper argues that although influential,agency theory is unable to provide sufficient understanding on many issues related to practices for the fact that corporate governance is not happening in social vacuum; it is affected by various other institutional factors and local context. Hence,in order to gain better understanding of corporate governance in emerging countries,alternatives perspectives or theories,such as institutional theory,should be employed by the researchers.

The presence of key institutional investors/owners and BOD characteristics as highlighted by Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may have influence on the yield to maturity (YTM) of bonds and sukuk. It is argued that higher institutional ownerships will produce enhanced active monitoring on cost of debt and presumably more control on the likelihood of default risk occurrence as measured by the size of yield spreads for conventional bonds and sukuk. Agency theory also explains the relationship between principal and agent and the possible misalignment of interest of both parties is reflected through the incurrence of what is termed as agency cost. To reduce this agency cost requires the necessity of incurrence of cost of monitoring and controlling by the principal which in large firms is represented by institutional investors which delegated this responsibility to the appointed board of directors (BOD). Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these corporate governance mechanisms with respect to institutional investors and BOD characteristics with the default risk as proxy by yield spread of bond and sukuk in Malaysia. The data are obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, Bondinfo Hub of Malaysian Central Bank, Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014. Unbalanced panel data are applied for the tests which cover the pooled ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models. The results suggest that the presence of institutional ownerships does have an inverse relationship on the default risk for long-term sukuk. However, the results do not support any relationship between institutional ownerships and long-term conventional bonds defaults. Mixed result reveal by BOD characteristics.

This study examined the influence of agency conflict Type I (as represented by managerial ownership and institutional ownership), and agency conflict Type II (as represented by control rights, cash flow rights, cash flow rights leverage) on earnings management. A model was developed and tested using a sample of 108 pyramidal structure companies listed on Indonesian stock exchange from 2008 to 2012. Data were collected and analyzed using least square regression model. The result showed that there is a significant association between managerial ownership and control rights. However, control rights (in agency conflict Type II) have the greatest influence on earnings management. Consequently, Type II agency conflict have the largest influence on earnings management compared to Type I agency conflict. The significance of the study is the potentials to assist the institutions and investors know the actual company performance and provides a better understanding of the agency theory more broadly viz. the relative impacts of Types I and II agency conflicts.

Corporate governance (CG) emerged many centuries ago, despite the debate on this subject and the widely-held view that it commenced in the 2000s. Thus, CG is not a new practice and over time it has become a precise system. In this study, the origins of CG are examined by the author in order to shed light on the underlying facts concerning the roots of this discipline and its history. By introducing such facts, it provides the background of the emergence of CG as clear principles and mechanisms. In the organizational sense, this study is considered important for both investors and organizations in applying the principles of CG and its mechanisms in all countries worldwide. The objective of this paper is to provide useful information to both researchers and practitioners in relation to CG including the fundamental principles and its history. This paper will present a solution to fill the gap in the literature concerning the relationship between CG and a firm's performance in such instances when the results of examining such a relationship are found to be inconsistent. A number of factors have contributed to this author's desire to research the relationship between a firm's performance and CG and that includes the author's experience and understanding of accounting over the years especially in the CG discipline, and also further to an in-depth literature review.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

Traditional agency theory (principal-agent conflict) has been a widely-accepted theoretical perspective for understanding corporate governance practices in developed economies. Institutions in these economies are characterized by effective contract enforcement, disperse ownership, separation of ownership, and control and protection of minority shareholders' rights. However, the principal-agent relationship, alone, may not be appropriate for analyzing corporate governance in emerging-economy institutional contexts, in which these institutional characteristics are often absent, weak, or poorly implemented. Scholars characterize corporate governance in emerging economies as having a conflict of interest between controlling and minority shareholders, known as the ''principal-principal agency model''. This relatively new sub-field has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines including finance, economics, and strategy. The present chapter attempts to synthesize and review conceptual and empirical developments regarding principal-principal conflicts, and suggests possible directions for future studies.

This study was conducted on the related party transaction (RPT) and earnings management. Agency theory provides that managers may engage into self-enrichment transactions to maximize their benefits at the detriment of the shareholders of the firm. Though,management or concentrated ownership was suggested as the possible solution to this problem,this form of ownership structure has its peculiar problems which are termed as Type II agency problem. Controlling shareholders are found to be using their voting power to extract extra benefits from the firm through the insider information and in many instances engage in detrimental RPTs at the expense of minority shareholders. This study have identified how and why controlling shareholders or managers use RPT as a means to perpetrate accrual-based or real activity earnings management. It was recommended that empirical study be conducted to investigate whether disclosure regulation can constrain the controlling shareholders or management against the use of real-activity management through RPT.

This chapter describes a theoretical framework that can be used to understand the impact of board gender diversity on board effectiveness and firm performance. It highlights four key theories: agency theory, resource dependency theory, gender role theory and upper echelons theory. The chapter reviews the arguments in the corporate governance literature for greater female boardroom representation. It deals with the ethical case and it considers the business case. The former is concerned with the principle that there should be no discrimination in the workplace, while the latter focuses on the benefits that women bring to the boardroom by drawing from a broader talent pool of directors. The chapter reviews the possible costs associated with an increase in the gender balance of boards.

Purpose - This paper aims to directly test the assertion by proponents of executive stock option repricing that repricing leads to increased management retention. Previous studies find either no effect or decreased retention following stock price repricing. This paper uses a more precise research design to re-examine the relationship between stock option retention and management retention. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use an empirical methodology and construct a sample of 158 firms and 201 repricing events, and a control sample of 201 non-repricing firms. They then examine executive turnover in the four years following the stock option repricing event. Findings - It was found that, consistent with agency theory, stock option repricing actually results in greater executive retention. Specifically, CEO retention is significantly greater for repricing firms relative to non-repricing firms for up to three years following the repricing date, and non-CEO executive retention is significantly greater for two years. Research limitations/implications - Firms continue to restructure management through stock option repricing. However, recent option repricing has been undertaken during a period when the economy is in decline, making it is difficult to disentangle effects of option repricing on management retention. Hence, this paper uses repricing data from an earlier period, from 1992-1997, when the economy was good. Originality/value - Many firms argue that when stock options are out-of-the-money and managerial talent is in demand, repricing executive stock options is necessary to retain managers. Previous studies find contradictory or no support for this view. Using a much more precise methodology, this paper shows that firms do retain managers when they reprice their options compared to when they do not. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper presents evidence on the role of ownership in dealing with corporate expropriation of listed companies in Malaysia. From the perspective of expropriation, a single controlling shareholder is always associated with such behavior due to their power and control at the expense of minority shareholder. However, subsequent individual or coalition of large shareholders can be an important corporate governance tool by providing effective monitoring that would lessen the possibility of expropriation by the controlling shareholder. Relating to that, this study evaluates the role of controlling and large shareholders in dealing with corporate expropriation. It is found that there is a negative relationship between single controlling shareholders and dividend payout ratio indicating that firms with only controlling shareholder will pay a lower dividend due to possible expropriation through profit diversion by controlling shareholder. Using Herfindahl Index as a proxy for ownership contestability, the presence of large shareholders along with controlling shareholder has a positive relationship with dividend payout implying that increased contestability helps to curb the power of controlling shareholder to expropriate fund for their own benefit. In accordance with agency theory, the outcome suggests that large shareholders play a monitoring role in minimizing the Type II agency problem. It is also verifying the argument made based on the Catering Theory of Dividend that the presence of large shareholder brings benefit to all shareholders as they are able to reduce profit diversion by demanding for higher dividend.

The high level of completion along with deceitful financial reporting has recently pointed the increasing consideration of researchers and academicians on the internal controls and internal audit functions (IAF). IAF in banks has several principles that are essential to be adhered. The bank's management bears the final responsibility to apply these principles properly and effectively to avoid such corporate scandals that would shake the confidence of investors and make it hard for organizations to enhance equity within the stock market. Thereby, they would need to understand the internal factors which influence their profitability performance. The main purpose of this paper is to develop the relationship between new standards of IAF issued by Basel Committee (2012) and banks' performance. In addition, it presents a theoretical research framework to understand this relationship supported by literature review from recent studies. The literature review indicates that practicing IAF creates discipline and enhances effectiveness of control and governance practices which are necessary to promote performance in the banks. Due to limitations of literature in bank sector, future studies are suggested to broaden the research empirically and highlight more on the effective IAF that can lead to better banks' performance.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates whether one classing companies have different firm value comparing with those of dual class picking-up the samples of 197 LCGs (Large Conglomerate Groups) firms listed in Korean Stock Market (KOSPI) with 1114 observations for 6 years (from 2009 to 2014). The assumption of Agency Theory that the conflict of interest between shareholder is used to measure the difference level which may be caused by the separation of ownership and control, and it is presumed that dual classing companies has more incentive to entrench minority shareholders when a management group's control rights exceed its cash-flow rights, and finally it could affect the firm value. The coefficient estimation with panel data shows that dual classing companies of LCGs are negatively related to firm value. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of Agency Theory that separation of control, ownership and cash flow rights brings incentive to expropriate the minority shareholders and is negative for the firm value.

This paper investigates the influence of the board's profile on the economic performance and value of companies publicly traded in Brazil. To assess such relationships, eight independent variables were used in the board's profile and three control variables in a sample of 180 companies listed on the BM & FBovespa. It was found that the age of the chairman of the board relates positively to the performance. The variables independence and board size are negatively related to the performance of the surveyed companies. There were no statistically significant results between independent variables and companies' value measured by Tobin's Q.

In the last decade, the interest for the study of ownership structure as a determinant of diversification arises. However, there is a lack of researches that analyze the influence of the nature of the ultimate owner in the level and type of diversification. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze the diversification strategies used by the main Spanish business groups whose parent company is listed on the stock markets, and to study the differences between family and non-family business groups, considering in these last, the type of ultimate owner. In the study a sample of ninety-nine listed companies is used, where companies that constitute the business group are identified. In the paper are used as econometric methodologies the binomial logistic models and panel data models. The results show that family nature of business group positively influences in specialization and related diversification and negatively on unrelated diversification. Family groups differ most form those non-family groups where there is not a reference shareholder than can exercise effective control and ownership dispersion is higher, the groups referred as "non effective control". The research allows further analysis of differences between family and non-family groups, considering the nature of the ultimate owner for non-family groups.

Research summary: Agency theory suggests that external governance mechanisms (e.g., activist owners, the market for corporate control, securities analysts) can deter managers from acting opportunistically. Using cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that powerful expectations imposed by external governance can impinge on top managers' feelings of autonomy and crowd out their intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to financial fraud. Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud. Our study considers external governance from a top manager's perspective and questions one of agency theory's foundational tenets: that external pressure imposed on managers reduces the potential for moral hazard. Managerial summary: Many of us are familiar with stories about top managers "cooking the books" in one way or another. As a result, companies and regulatory bodies often implement strict controls to try to prevent financial fraud. However, cognitive evaluation theory describes how those external controls could actually have the opposite of their intended effect because they rob managers of their intrinsic motivation for behaving appropriately. We find this to be the case. When top managers face more stringent external control mechanisms, in the form of activist shareholders, the threat of a takeover, or zealous securities analysts, they are actually more likely to engage in financial misbehavior.

This article intends to review the theoretical aspects and empirical evidences made on agency theory. It is aimed to explore the main ideas, perspectives, problems and issues related to the agency theory through a literature survey. It discusses the theoretical aspects of agency theory and the various concepts and issues related to it and documents empirical evidences on the mechanisms that diminish the agency cost. The conflict of interest and agency cost arises due to the separation of ownership from control, different risk preferences, information asymmetry and moral hazards. The literatures have cited many solutions like strong ownership control, managerial ownership, independent board members and different committees can be useful in controlling the agency conflict and its cost. This literature survey will enlighten the practitioners and researchers in understanding, analysing the agency problem and will be helpful in mitigating the agency problem.

This study investigates the impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments in the context of emerging economies. Using a dataset of listed firms from India, China and Russia over the period 2007-2014, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that board gender diversity is negatively related to cash dividend payments in all emerging economies. Moreover, we find that state-ownership positively moderates the relationship between gender diversity and dividend payments. However, this effect is observed only for China and Russia. In additional analyses, we find that the negative link between board gender diversity and dividend payments is more pronounced during the financial crisis. However, the moderating role of state-ownership does not remain significant during the financial crisis. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study investigates the impact of internal corporate governance on the relation between disclosure quality and earnings management in the UK listed companies, in particular whether governance mechanisms have deterrent effect on earnings management similar to firms' disclosure quality. Unlike prior literature, we measure a number of board and audit committee-related governance instruments, three disclosure quality proxies (i.e. Investor Relation Magazine Award, Forward-Looking Disclosure and Analyst Forecast Accuracy) and the Modified Jones Model to test the hypotheses of the study on a matched-pair sample data of Investor Relation Magazine Award winning and non-winning firms. Our findings in the OLS and sensitivity analyses using Heckman Procedure and 2SLS regressions consistently report a significant negative association between earnings management and disclosure quality for all proxies in restraining earnings management. In contrast, corporate governance variables are mostly insignificantly related to earnings management. This provides an emerging trend of the outperformance of disclosure quality over internal governance mechanisms in lessening earnings management. These findings warrant due attention of the policy makers, investors, corporate firms and other stakeholders in shaping a high-quality disclosure and governance regime in corporate settings to mitigate managerial manipulations of earnings across the countries in the world.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG, 2007 and 2012) on the performance of the listed companies in Malaysia. The agency theory and resource dependency theories indicate that the firms with strong corporate governance outperform firms with weaker governance. This paper explores this relationship in a developing country like Malaysia having different institutional environment compared to western countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 113 listed companies in Malaysia. The study incorporates the endogenous relationship between corporate governance, firm performance and leverage. Findings: The study analyzes how the corporate governance framework affected firm performance in Malaysia with the help of self-developed corporate governance index (MCGI). The authors' findings show that the performance of the firm is positively and significantly related with corporate governance measured by MCGI. Secondly, corporate governance of sample firms shows marked improvements after implementation of MCCG 2012 as compared to MCCG 2007. Originality/value: The findings of this paper support the agency and the resource dependency theories. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the corporate governance and firm performance in emerging economy and builds a case for enforcement of strong corporate governance code by government agencies.

Previous earnings management research has largely focused on firm-level governance mechanisms in single countries or on macro-level variables in multiple countries. Building on this research, we incorporate firm ownership predictors along with national institutional dimensions to explore why firm decision makers in emerging markets vary in their earnings management behavior. Our theoretical framework integrates agency and institutional theories proposing that firm-level ownership mechanisms do not function in isolation, but are reinforced or attenuated by elements of the institutional governance environment. The multilevel empirical analysis of 1200 firms in 24 emerging markets indicates that controlling ownership is positively related to earnings management. We find that the level of minority shareholder protection in a country weakens this positive relationship. We also find that regulatory quality strengthens the negative relationship between institutional ownership and earnings management activity. It is hoped that awareness of how firm ownership structures interact with national-level institutions in affecting firm-level behavior will help managers and investors develop skills and practices to better cope with business norms in emerging economies.

It is well known that firm-level corporate governance practices vary mainly between rather than within countries, but country-level factors such as legal and financial institutions explain less than 50% of this cross-country variation. In this article we show that two dimensions of national culture-individualism and uncertainty avoidance-capture about 90% of the country fixed effects and outperform the country-level explanatory variables used in prior literature. We argue that culture works through a tradeoff between managerial expertise and certainty of control, a tradeoff largely overlooked by prior literature, that captures a country's preference for the Anglo-Saxon approach versus the direct control approach for governance. Consistent with this argument, we find that the effect of culture on corporate governance varies across firms with different needs for managerial expertise and certainty of control. We also find that culture interacts with other factors to determine firm-level governance. (c) 2017 Academy of International Business. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory boards (SSBs) on the performance of Islamic banks (IBs). It also tests whether SSBs' attributes affect the performance of IBs. Based on a sample of 1, 803 Islamic bank-year observations from 82 banks in 15 countries over the period 1993-2014 and controlling for factors known to affect bank performance, this study reveals a robust and significant positive relationship between SSBs and Islamic bank performance. This study also shows that the characteristics of SSBs affect the performance of IBs. This research reveals how SSBs influence the performance of IBs, as well as the processes and roles SSBs use to ensure Shari'ah compliance in business transactions. Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this study design is to relate SSB presence, size and diversity to financial performance using three techniques. The first technique is a multivariate data analysis that analyzes data arising from more than one variable. The second technique is a clustered regression (clustering by bank), which corrects for serial correlation and produces unbiased t-statistics. Because this sample is drawn from panel data, it is expected serial autocorrelation of the independent variables and error term within banks. In cases where within-company correlation exists, t-statistics based on average regression coefficients from year-by-year regression are upwardly biased and potentially severe (Peterson, 2009). Therefore, this study uses a technique that agrees with Stock and Watson (2002), who show that the standard method of calculating heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the fixed-effects estimator generates inconsistent variance estimates. Thus, using the clustered regression is consistent with the fixed-effects estimator. The third technique is a two-stage least-squares regression that helps build an instrumental variable for robustness tests purposes. Findings - The findings suggest that large corporate boards and large SSBs are more efficient in dealing with different monitoring and advisory roles than small SSBs. Consequently, this suggests that increasing the size of corporate boards and SSBs should improve monitoring and advisory functions, management behavior and organizational performance. Research limitations/implications - It is possible that there is an upper limit to this benefit, however; we do not explore this limit, which therefore provides opportunities for additional research. Because Shari'ah compliance relates only to a rational legal framework of negative screening relegated to interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty. The interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty have not been investigated between the two samples due to data unavailability. In addition, limited accounting-based measures of financial performance may not accurately portray IB performance; hence, an additional market measure is implemented, which is Tobin's Q. Practical implications - Ultimately, these findings could help IBs improve their financial results by enhancing their internal and external governance mechanisms (Walsh and Seward, 1990). They provide a basis for developing larger, more diverse SSBs that are more focused on complying with Shari'ah and corporate governance. The results also have significant policy implications for improving firm-level corporate governance versus improving country-level institutional factors. Both views have their advocates. However, it is very difficult to reform the legal system in a short time. Still, this study shows that struggling IBs have a way to improve their corporate governance and simultaneously improve their financing environment. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature on the effects of SSBs on IBs' organizational financial performance, processes and roles. It is the first to examine empirically the underpinnings of how SSBs affect organizational financial performance via agency theory and contingency theory. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

We identify how barriers to absorptive capacity limit success in integrating external technology by firms in emerging markets. We refine previous barriers to absorptive capacity and classify them into internal (managerial biases and weak social integration mechanisms) and external (muted activation triggers, conflicting source relationships, and feeble appropriability regimes). We also identify how particular conditions in emerging markets (higher restraints on incentives, higher information asymmetries, and weaker contract protection) heighten the barriers. Using agency theory as the theoretical base, we provide a better understanding of absorptive capacity and of the influence of the home country on capability upgrading. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The recent financial crisis has brought to the forefront the need for companies to effectively manage their risks. In this regard, one approach that has gained prominence is enterprise risk management (ERM). Importantly, little is known about the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. This link is critical, because it is imperative that financial reporting adequately depicts the financial status (e.g., valuations, estimates) and associated risks of a company as revealed by ERM. Additionally, from an auditing perspective, ERM affects the risks of misstatement, which should impact audit planning. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the experiences of audit partners, CFOs, and audit committee (AC) members ("the governance triad") on the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. To determine whether members of the governance triad focus on monitoring, strategy, or both, we also examine their definition of and experiences with ERM with respect to agency and/or resource dependence theory. To address these issues, we conduct semistructured interviews of experienced individuals that form the governance triads from 11 public companies. There are three major findings from our study. First, importantly, all three types of participants see a strong link between ERM and the financial reporting process. Second, despite recognition of the broad nature of ERM, the predominant experiences of the actual roles played by triad members center on agency theory, while resource dependence may be relatively underemphasized by all triad members. Finally, CFOs and AC members indicate that auditors may be especially underutilizing ERM in the audit process, suggesting an "expectations gap.". (c) CAAA

This study examines how financial reporting quality affects corporate dividend policy. We find that higher quality reporting is associated with higher dividends. This positive association is more pronounced among firms with more severe free cash flow problems and among firms with higher ownership by monitoring-type institutional investors. Further analysis of the relation between reporting quality and under-/over-payment of dividends suggests that reporting quality largely mitigates underpayment of dividends. Additionally, both a granger causality test and a difference-in-difference analysis of dividend changes around a quasi-exogenous reporting event yield evidence consistent with the direction of causality going from financial reporting to dividends. Overall, these findings are consistent with financial reporting quality acting as a governance mechanism that induces managers to pay dividends by disciplining free cash flow problems. Our findings support the view that dividends are the result of enhanced monitoring (Jensen 1986; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny 2000).

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Past empirical efforts in corporate governance have examined the effects of large shareholders with excess control rights on tunneling activities. However, no study has systematically investigated the effects of multiple large shareholders on excess leverage policies and tunneling in an emerging country environment where minority rights protection is weak. In this study, we examine the role of multiple large shareholders and the effects of control contestability of multiple large shareholders on firm excess leverage decision and tunneling by controlling shareholders. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 2,341 Chinese firms for the years 2001 to 2013, we document that the contestability of multiple non-controlling large shareholders relative to controlling shareholders reduces the adoption of excess leverage policies, tunneling and enhances capital investment. Another intriguing finding is that the government, as a controlling shareholder, exerts significant influence and reduces the monitoring effectiveness of multiple larger shareholders. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By addressing the role of multiple large shareholders on excess leverage decisions, this study makes an important contribution to the corporate governance literature. We extend the recent developments in agency theory regarding the role of multiple large shareholders in constraining expropriation of controlling shareholders with excess control rights and their effect on firm leverage decisions. Our results support the theoretical models which indicate that the presence of multiple large shareholders is an important and efficient internal governance mechanism that mitigates a firm's agency costs, particularly, in an emerging market environment where corporate governance is weak and inadequate to curb the tunneling problem.

This study relies on environmental stewardship, a stakeholder-enlarged view of stewardship theory, and institutional theory to analyze the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' environmental commitment in a worldwide sample of 520 large listed firms. Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms. When designing compensation for CEOs, compensation committees and external compensation advisors should consider psychological and institutional factors that might affect CEO motivation.

We test in a European context the impact of countries' lending infrastructure on SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) capital structure. Devised from Berger and Udell (2006), this infrastructure is comprised of the information, legal, judicial, bankruptcy, social, tax and regulatory environments. We find that SME debt is higher in countries with more efficient bankruptcy environments in terms of debt recovery and in countries with less stringent regulatory environments by way of lower capital regulatory requirements for banks. Components of the lending infrastructure are found to differ with debt maturity. Long-term debt is synonymous with efficient bankruptcy environments, whilst the information and legal environments matter more for short-term debt. The regulatory environment is important for both long-term and short-term debt. Our results also lend support for the Pecking-Order, Trade-Off and Agency theories of capital structure.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

The agency theory and law and finance literatures show good country governance encourages financial development, mitigates agency problems, and increases firm value. Drawing on these literatures, we develop a theory that benefits from good country governance are portable by firms across countries through cross-border acquisitions. Using acquisitions from 56 countries from 1990 to 2007, we find that acquirers can transport the benefits from good country governance, so that they gain more from acquiring targets with worse country governance than their own. As predicted, the acquirer's stock-price reaction to acquisitions increases with the country governance distance between the acquirer and the target.

We draw on the socioemotional wealth perspective to examine the influence of family ownership on firms' noncompliance with corporate governance codes. Our results yield an inverted U-shaped effect of family ownership on noncompliance. While the family influence and control dimension leads to high levels of noncompliance, socioworthiness stemming from image and reputation dimension lessens noncompliance. In the presence of potential agency conflict, the control dimension prevails over reputation, even in countries with strong governance institutions. Our findings have critical implications for family business theory, for governance policy making and also for better understanding corporate governance in family firms.

Research summary: Shareholder activism has become more widespread, yet the role of corporate governance as antecedent to shareholder activism remains equivocal. We propose a new conceptual model that characterizes the stochastic of observable shareholder activism as a compound product of two latent components representing (1) shareholder activists' propensity to target a company and (2) executives' propensity to settle activists' demands privately. Our model explicitly decouples corporate governance expectations for the two latent components embedded in activism process, and thus allows us to relax assumptions of homogenous shareholder interests and constrained managerial discretion where corporate managers are expected to negotiate privately and settle only value-creating activist demands. Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated Poisson regression reveals that corporate governance relationships with activism vary across shareholder demands and private settlements. Managerial summary: Increasing shareholder activism has generated debates as to whether activism promotes managerial accountability and responsibility or instead encourages managerial short-termism. Our research model allows for heterogeneous interests among a company's shareholders. We theorize and empirically investigate a broader role of corporate governance: governance mechanisms need to ensure that executives are not (1) ignoring activists' value-increasing demands or (2) accommodating activists' value-decreasing demands in a private, opaque manner that disenfranchises other shareholders. Our results indicate that corporate governance implications differ for visible shareholder demands in contrast with private activism. A plausible application of our model is that it provides estimates of the probability of the numbers of shareholder demands to be received by a firm and the probability of privately settling a demand.

There has been much debate concerning the innovative output of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. The purpose of this study was to show that the impact of family ownership differs depending on important governance conditions. Drawing on secondary data from the German machine tool industry from 2000 to 2010, we show that it is not family ownership per se that drives or impedes innovation in terms of the number of patents granted to a firm. Increases in the degree of family ownership and the generation of the family reduce the innovative output, whereas dedicated family business institutions nurture it. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and management. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

This study aims to examine the influence of board independence on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting by publicly listed companies in Malaysia. Content analysis was used to determine the extent of CSR reporting. A reporting index consisting of 51 items was developed based on six themes: General, Community, Environment, Human Resources, Marketplace and Other. An Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression was used to examine the relationship between board independence and firm CSR reporting. The results indicate that the association between board independence and company CSR reporting is industry specific. Overall, the empirical evidence partially supports agency theory.

This study seeks to understand the leading role played by the blockholders and their true governance mechanism, in the French context, characterised by complex ownership structures. We focus on the role that second-tier shareholders can play in the optimal governance of companies and in their capacity to solve both principal/agent and principal/principal agency conflicts. Using a sample of 2118 observations between 2000 and 2009, we find that second-tier shareholders exercise effective additional monitoring when power is contestable but increase principal/principal agency costs in the presence of a controlling owner. We also show that shareholder homogeneity reduces agency conflicts. Our results demonstrate that the level of control contestability is essential in the understanding of governance mechanisms. Such contestability is to be found simultaneously at institutional level, at the level of the balance of power between blockholders, and according to the nature of the shareholders. Thus, the usual agency theory conclusions are debateable when the legal framework offers little protection of minority shareholders, and when ownership structure is complex and heterogeneous in nature. The study of corporate governance must therefore encompass a twofold analytical perspective, namely, an institutional and a socio-organisational one. The analysis and findings could be particularly useful in assessing corporate governance in the context of several European countries with a similar self-dealing legal environment to the French one, including Italy and Greece.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between company ownership structure and financial performance in the context of the largest Central European stock market. Using the framework of agency theory, the authors address the question of the expropriation effect by dominant owners and the effect of collusion between shareholders of different types on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test hypotheses on the relations between ownership concentration and the involvement of different shareholders (state, CEO, industry and financial investors) vs return on assets (ROA). The authors adopt the panel model controlling for endogeneity and sector of operation and analyze the data from the unique sample of 495 Polish non-financial firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in years 2005-2014 with a total of 3,203 observations. Findings: The authors identify a negative correlation between ownership concentration by the majority shareholder and ROA, which corresponds with the expropriation rationale of blockholders. The authors also observe negative effects due to ownership concentration by the second largest shareholder, supporting the notion of collusion. The results show that ownership by industry investors is associated with a higher ROA. Ownership by the CEO, state and financial investors proves to have no statistically significant effect on performance. Originality/value: The paper further develops the nature of ownership-performance relations in the specific economic context of a post-transition, emerging European stock market, weak external corporate governance mechanisms, insufficient investor protection and significant concentration of share ownership. The results add to the understanding of monitoring vs expropriation effects by large owners and the collusion between different types of shareholders. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This research examines the relationship between independent directors, the audit committee (AC), and firm performance, taking into account the impact of the chief executive officer's powers and block shareholders. We use the maximum likelihood estimator, based on agency theory assumptions and cylindered panel data, to examine three models of firm performance. The results show that the independence of the board is reflected clearly by increased economic and equity performance of the firm. However, an AC that is fully independent or meets frequently is associated with lower firm performance. Unlike pension funds, institutional shareholders can be considered an effective control mechanism in the context of France. Our results development includes advanced explanations for market liquidity and shareholders' portfolios. The study period ends before the European regulation on ACs came into effect in 2008. This allows for an appreciation of soft law in French corporate governance. It also lets us compare the data with the way firms operate their boards one decade later. The evidence provides useful guidelines on the supremacy of soft law in corporate governance and suggests that the composition and functioning of the board of directors should be moderated based on the firms' context. The specificity of the cylindered panel data helps to better examine the impact of the board and AC's independence and functioning in French corporate governance structure.

We examine the longitudinal relationship between ownership structure and firm internationalization, in a sample of Indian firms. Drawing on principal-principal (PP) agency theory and the resource-based-view (RBV) of the firm, we argue that divergent preferences (motivations) of a firm's owners affect the firm's propensity to internationalize, while resource heterogeneity among these owners (owners' capability to access and provide resources) affects the firm's capability to internationalize. We argue that both motivation and capability are required for firms to pursue internationalization and that when either of these is missing in an owner, that owner's shareholding will be negatively associated with internationalization. Additionally, our results uncover an interesting dichotomy. While family owners with lower levels of ownership favor their firms' internationalization, they do not favor it at higher levels of ownership. Our results indicate that foreign owners appeared to adjust their roles to accommodate the preferences of the dominant family owners. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate simultaneous relations between corporate governance (CG) practice and cash flow right, cash flow leverage (the divergence between control right and cash flow right of controlling shareholders). The two ownership measures reflect alignment and expropriation incentives of controlling shareholders. This study also examines the effect of multiple large shareholders (MLSs) on CG practice. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses publicly listed companies (PLCs) excluding those from the Indonesian finance sector during 2011-2013 as the samples of the study. Two-stages least squares regression models were used to test the simultaneous relations between CG practice and ownership structure variables. The study develops a CG instrument to measure CG practice based on ASEAN CG Scorecard, that comprehensively covers OECD CG principles and that can be used for panel data. Findings: CG practice has a positive influence on cash flow right and has a marginally negative impact on cash flow leverage, while cash flow right and cash flow leverage have a marginally negative impact on CG practice. Further, the existence of large MLS complements CG practice, but as the control right of the second largest shareholders becomes closer to the largest shareholder, the complement relation becomes less important. State- or foreign-controlled PLCs practice better CG than other PLCs. Research limitations/implications: Studies on CG/ownership structure need to treat CG and ownership structure as endogenous variables in their research design. In addition, the level of rule of law in a country should be taken into account when examining the relation between CG and ownership structure. The interrelation among CG, ownership structure, capital structure and firm performance has been studied in the context of dispersed ownership structure and strong rule of law. Thus, future study needs to examine the interrelation among these four concepts in countries with high concentrated ownership and weak rule of law. Practical implications: To minimize the risk of expropriation, investors in the capital market need to select shares of PLCs that practice CG suitable for the ownership structure of PLCs, have high ownership by the largest shareholder and have no divergence between control and ownership right, and or have MLSs. PLCs may need to choose the level of CG mechanism in the context of their ownership structure and consider the benefits and costs implementing them. Social implications: The study supports the "one size does not fit all" perspective on CG and, thus, it supports the recently enacted financial service authority (FSA) rule requiring PLCs to follow the "comply or explain" rule on the CG code for PLCs. The FSA needs to enforce the compliance of PLCs with CG rules and encourage PLCs to implement CG in substance, not just in form. To strengthen the positive impact of good CG practice in attracting investments in capital market, the regulator needs to improve investor protection rules and ensure strong rule of law. Originality/value: The study is the first to examine the simultaneous relation between CG practice and both cash flow right and cash flow leverage of the largest shareholder. It is also the first that investigates the impact of MLS on CG practice. It explores the complement and substitution relation between the two concepts in reducing agency costs. In term of research design, the study develops a CG instrument that is based on OECD CG principles, that can be used for panel data and that uses public information.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the association between firm size, profitability, leverage, auditor type and internet reporting and investigate the moderating effect of legal system, investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies of independent variables. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a meta-analytic review for 59 research papers to synthesise quantitatively the results of previous literature on the determinants of internet reporting. This study uses Hunter and Schmidt's (2004) procedures to conduct the analysis. There are three main procedures to be followed: calculating the weighted effect size, calculating observed correlation variance and sampling error variance and, finally, testing for homogeneity and moderating effects. Findings: The results indicate a significant positive association between firm size, profitability, leverage, auditor type and internet reporting. The results confirm the prediction of agency theory, signalling theory, political cost hypothesis and diffusion of innovation theory. Moreover, the results show that investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies for independent variables moderate the association between profitability, leverage and internet reporting. Research limitations/implications: This study suffers from some limitations. First, corporate governance variables such as board size, role duality and board independence were not included in the analysis due to the limited number of studies that discuss the association between corporate governance and internet reporting. Second, the study does not control for the endogeneity problem. Practical implications: Future research has to consider the moderating effect of investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies for independent variables on the association between corporate characteristics and internet reporting. Future research can extend this work by examining the association between corporate governance, ownership structure and internet reporting. The findings regarding the determinants of internet reporting should be on concern of regulatory authorities. Originality/value: This study contributes to and extends previous meta-analysis literature by examining internet reporting determinants, as previous financial reporting meta-analysis studies give no attention to internet reporting.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of investments in organisational resources and corporate governance features on market-based performance of Islamic banks (IBs). Design/methodology/approach: The required data to calculate different constituents of banks' investment strategies and governance mechanism were hand collected from 268 annual reports. Different regression models were used to determine the impact of investment in human and structural capital and corporate governance features on market performance of IBs. Findings: The paper finds that investments in knowledge resources (human capital, in particular) have a significantly positive impact on the market value of IBs. The results further reveal that IBs' strategy to rely on long-term human capital accumulation can be seen as idiosyncratic problem-solving knowledge capital. Based on market measure, the paper finds role duality to have a significant positive impact and the size of the advisory board to have the opposite effect on market value. Research limitations/implications: This study includes IBs only and ignores other Islamic financial services providers such as Takaful (insurance) companies. The study leaves this chasm to be filled by future researchers. Practical implications: The findings may serve as a useful input for both Islamic bankers and regulators to apply knowledge management in their institutions. Furthermore, the dominant role of human capital also provides insight to managers with respect to business performance levers. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide insight into the Islamic banking business model using a unique hand-collected data set, to identify the effect of investments in organisational resources and bank governance on market value in before, during and after financial crisis.

Based on agency theory, this study analyzes whether family firms are more compliant with corporate governance recommendations than non-family firms in the context of emerging markets. Using a unique sample of 826 observations of the highest ranked companies on the stock exchange indices of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010, we hypothesize that family firms may adopt better corporate governance practices to substitute for the absence or inefficiency of a regulatory system and to mitigate the agency problem between majority and minority shareholders. Additionally, we propose a corporate governance compliance index considering the legal and institutional framework of the region. The empirical results indicate that family firms report a higher corporate governance index. We find that board composition (independence, size and COB-CEO duality) does not moderate corporate governance compliance of family firms but rather such variables have a direct effect on the corporate governance index.

This paper investigates the relationship between decision making power of chief executive officers (CEOs) and corporate capital structure in the context of emerging market characterized by deep collectivism and less prescriptive regulatory and legislative environment. Using a sample of 297 firms listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange SMEs Board from 2009 to 2013, it finds a hump-shaped association between CEO power and leverage suggesting a strong nonlinearity between these two variables. Furthermore, the results show that the entrenchment effect of CEO power on firm leverage becomes more fiercely in state-owned firms. Our findings are robust to alternative calculation procedures for the CEO power index and to alternative estimation techniques. The shareholders and policy makers might leverage our findings to improve the performance of CEOs in the Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how Moroccan institutional investors view dividend policy. It discusses the importance these investors attach to the dividend policy of their investee firms, how much influence they exercise in shaping investee firms' dividend policies, their reactions to changes in dividends, and their views on various explanations for paying dividends. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey provides a respondent and firm profile and responses to 28 questions involving various explanations for paying dividends and 30 questions on different dividend issues. Findings: Institutional investors attach substantial importance to dividend policy and prefer high dividend payments. Although liquidity needs are a major driver, taxes play little role in shaping dividend preferences. Respondents agree with multiple explanations for paying dividends giving the strongest support to catering, bird-in-the-hand, life cycle, signaling, and agency theories. Research limitations/implications: Despite a high response rate, the number of respondents limits partitioning the sample and testing for significant differences between different groups. Practical implications: The lack of communication between Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE) listed firms and institutional investors may depress stock prices and increase volatility. The results suggest agency problems and a weak governance environment at the CSE. Originality/value: This study documents the importance that institutional investors place on dividend policy, their reactions to changes in their investees' dividend policy, and the methods used to influence these firms. It extends previous research by reporting the level of support Moroccan institutional investors give to various explanations for paying dividends. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study analyses the external antecedents of board diversity. We use the resource-based view and the agency theory to investigate the impact of institutional and foreign shareholders on national board diversity. Because we highlight that the most used diversity indices neglect the multidimensional aspect of diversity, we refer to diversity profiles and suggest the functional data analysis approach for diversity assessment in corporate governance studies. Specifically, we use the parametric functional analysis of variance in analysing the influence exerted by institutional and foreign shareholders on national board diversity. Focusing on a sample of 1,230 Italian medium-large firms, our results show that institutional shareholders do not influence national board diversity, while foreign shareholders strongly affect it, especially when they hold more than 50% of shares. Thus, we address the research gap on the determinants of national board diversity and enrich comparative European research on this topic. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the firms' ownership and control structure and their export performance. The literature is traditionally focused on the relationship between firms' performance and internationalization, with the relationship between ownership and control structure with internationalization being much less studied, particularly in the context of family firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors focus their study on the Portuguese wine firms due to their increasing importance in the Portuguese economy and in the promotion of the country's exports and image abroad. They used a balanced panel data sample of 82 firms for the period from 2011 to 2015 and applied a random effects model and a Tobit specification. Findings: The degree of family involvement shows a negative and significant relationship with internationalization, meaning that family firms that intend to internationalize should be open to receive external managers with international experience and increase their internal competencies to enhance internationalization. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature since assesses, at the light of the agency theory, the presence of differences in the internationalization degree and export intensity between family firms that are managed and controlled by the owners and family firms that are managed by non-family members, with an application to a less studied sector and country.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether family CEOs benefit investment efficiency under uncertainty with Chinese family firms and to test the moderating effect of ownership structure, including family ownership, the separation of family control from family ownership and the multiple large shareholder structure. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effects models are designed for a sample of 5,734 firm-year observations for Chinese family firms from 2009 to 2014. Findings: The results show that investment efficiency is low under uncertainty, and having family CEOs can reduce this negative relationship. Further analysis reveals that for firms with family CEOs, the negative effect of uncertainty on investment efficiency is weaker when the family has higher ownership, when family control is less separated from family ownership, or when family firms have multiple large shareholder structures. Research limitations/implications: The authors do not distinguish founder-CEOs and descendant-CEOs. Most of Chinese family firms are still managed by founders, so the authors cannot explore the generation effect although different generations manage firms differently. Because family succession is becoming a more and more important problem in China, further research may be able to explore the generation effect. Practical/implications: This paper suggests that in emerging economies with weak investor protection, outside minority shareholders can avoid expropriation from family owners by investing in firms with large family ownership, little separation of family control from ownership or multiple large shareholder structure. In addition, policymakers can encourage institutional investors to participate in family business to improve corporate governance. Originality/value: Drawing on both Type I and Type II agency theory perspectives, the authors argue that although family CEOs can generally benefit firms' investment efficiency, the benefits vary with firms' ownership structure. In other words, family CEOs are not absolute agents or stewards but some extent of combination of both. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between board leadership structures and executive compensation. According to agency theory, the combined position of CEO and Chairperson of the Board (COB) entails greater compensation for the CEO in order to reduce conflicts of interest. In the literature, combined board structure is generally considered to generate additional costs for companies. However, the choice of two separate structures implies the payment of incentive compensation for the COB in addition to that defined for the CEO. This paper investigates the financial cost of duality when compensation packages are set for both leaders. Our results suggest that although combined board structure is associated with higher incentive compensation for the CEO, the overall compensation cost to the company is no higher when the chairperson's compensation is considered.

We combine agency theory with the law and finance approach to analyze how the legal protection of investors and the corporate ownership structure affect corporate investment in research and development (R&D). We use information from 956 firms from the five most R&D-intensive industries in 19 developed countries. Our results show that better protection of investors' rights by the institutional environment has a positive influence on corporate R&D. We also find that corporate ownership concentration works as a substitute for legal protection. This finding means that R&D investment of the firms in the countries with poor legal protection increases as ownership becomes more concentrated. Our results also show that the identity of shareholders has a relevant effect: Whereas banks and nonfinancial institutions as shareholders result in lower R&D, institutional investors as shareholders increase corporate investment in R&D.

**** *ID_Smith201738_1991_
This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of internal corporate governance mechanisms on the capital structure decisions of Chinese-listed firms. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large and more recent data set consisting of 2,386 Chineselisted firms over the period from 1998 to 2012, the authors use different statistical methods (OLS, fixed effects and system GMM) to analyse the effects of firm-specific and corporate governance influences on capital structure. Findings - The authors find that the proportion of independent directors and ownership concentration exert significant influence on the level of Chinese long-term debt ratios after controlling for firm-specific determinants and split share reforms. Further analysis separating the sample of this paper into state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs) suggests that ownership concentration in the hands of the state leads to decrease in debt ratios. Research limitations/implications - The finding implies that concentrated ownership in the hands of the state appears more efficient compared to their private counterparts in their monitoring role. Originality/value - This paper extends prior literature, which has concentrated disproportionately on firm-specific influences on capital structure, to the effects of within-firm governance mechanisms on capital structure decisions. The paper contributes to the agency theory-capital structure discourse in an emerging country context where corporate governance system appears weak. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines how ownership concentration affects dividend payout, and ultimately firm performance. Regression analyses are performed on a dataset spanning 11 years (2005-2015) among Malaysian publicly listed firms. The results show that shareholders with concentrated ownership play an important role in determining dividend payout and driving firm performance. Specifically, ownership concentration is associated with low dividend payout, but it improves firm performance. Overall, this study suggests that ownership concentration may also be an effective monitoring mechanism.

This paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive-based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement. Compared to acquirers in the low equity-based compensation group, acquirers in the high equity-based compensation group outperform by 9.54% in a five-day period surrounding the announcement date. These results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues. We further find that acquirers with higher equity-based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions. An increase in director equity-based pay also results in a lower acquisition premium for targets. These results indicate that equity-based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate whether operating and market performance are aligned to CEO compensation and how board governance and dividend policy could influence pay-performance link in the capital market of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The hand-collected information on 219 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) is acquired over the period 2012-2016. Additionally, panel data technique, namely Prais-Winsten (PCSE) and 2SLS (robust standard errors) regression are applied to account for the heteroscedasticity, serial correlation and endogeneity issue. Findings: The empirical results indicate that CEO compensation is positively associated with operating performance and market performance. The evidence also provides partial support to agency perspective that board independence and optimal board size could positively, while CEO duality negative moderates the relationship between operating performance and CEO compensation. However, none of these mechanisms are proved to be effective in aligning market performance to CEO compensation. In fact, dividend policy negatively moderates the association between firm performance (operating and market) and CEO compensation. Thus, contrary to the agency theory's proposition, dividend policy cannot be utilized as a substitute control device in the absence of strong corporate governance mechanisms. Practical Implications: In light of this empirical evidence, regulatory bodies in Pakistan could improve corporate governance mechanisms as well as CEO compensation structure to ensure remunerative and ethical financial market. Originality/value: This study contributes to the academic literature by validating the underexplored pay-performance alignment propositions of agency theorists, especially in the reference of Pakistan.

The article tries to examine the relationship between equity ownership held by the foreign institutional investors and firm performance both in a static and a dynamic framework. We also examine how the relationship differs between group-affiliated and stand-alone firms. By employing the 2SLS panel data estimation technique on 137 BSE listed Indian firms, the study finds that foreign institutional investment has a positive influence on the firm performance as measured through Tobin's Q and ROA.Application of linear dynamic panel data estimation in a dynamic framework also yields similar results.The latter method also shows that FII has a positive significant effect on Tobin's Q in group-affiliated firms. The results are analysed from the perspective of a multi-theoretic approach consisting of agency theory, information asymmetry theory, institutional theory and resource dependency theory.

This paper examines how family firms substitute corporate governance with family governance and self-governance at different stages of their development. We argue that the types of agency problems that family firms face as they pass from one generation to the next determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be used as substitutes for one another. Our empirical investigation provides evidence that in the early stages of a family firm's life cycle, instruments of self-governance lessen the need for mechanisms of corporate governance, whereas in the later stages, instruments of family governance can substitute for mechanisms of corporate governance.

Diversification is a common goal for many small firms, yet research examining whether small firm ownership structure influences their use of the tactic is limited. As such, this paper provides one of the first empirical investigations of the subject by examining whether the presence of a corporate parent positively influences the likelihood that small firms will utilize diversification. Results indicate that small firms with corporate parents are more likely to use both related and unrelated diversification than comparable firms that are independently owned. Such findings are noteworthy because diversification may be more beneficial for small, independently owned firms, yet small, subsidiary firms appear to be better able to utilize diversification. Implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2017 Small Business Institute.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between CEO pay slice (CPS) - the fraction of the top five executive directors' total compensation that is captured by the chief executive officer (CEO) - and the value of firms in the UK. Specifically, this paper examines whether CPS alters the effectiveness of board performance by influencing cooperation and cohesiveness among its members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses a large sample of non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange from 1997 to 2010. The empirical methodology includes the analysis of panel data by using a dynamic generalized method of moments estimator. Findings: The evidence supports social comparison theory and demonstrates that high CPS is likely to impact negatively on executive team's spirit and motivation. However, the tournament argument is supported when a subsample of companies with CEOs close to retirement age has been analysed. In addition, the findings suggest that companies perform better after the introduction of non-binding say on pay law in the UK in 2002. Practical implications: The results have major implications for the on-going debate on how to reform executive remuneration, and highlight the importance of considering remuneration issues at the board level, supporting the principles of UK Corporate Governance Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2010). Originality/value: The results indicate that CPS can provide a useful tool for research on firm performance, and that its relation with the value of firms is an important issue to be considered in the UK context. The findings also highlight the importance of considering board-wide remuneration issues without narrowing them down simply to the details of CEO compensation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the importance of socioemotional wealth (SEW) to family firms in Poland viewed through the lens of the events surrounding the first hostile takeover bid of the post-communist era on the Warsaw Stock Exchange when the clothing company Vistula & Wolczanka (V&W) made an unsolicited, leveraged bid for the family-controlled jewelry company W. Kruk. Design/methodology/approach: The 2008 takeover and its aftermath are described in the context of the corporate governance and legal environment in Poland. The case study events demonstrate the connection between firm behavior and SEW theory. Findings: After the acquisition of W. Kruk by V&W, the Kruk family purchased stock in the newly named Vistula Group and gained influence over the supervisory board in concert with a business ally, eventually wresting back control of the company in the style of a Pac-Man "defense." The case study illustrates the importance of SEW in family firm takeovers. Research limitations/implications: The case study design has limitations for generalizability. Nevertheless the research highlights the important role of SEW preservation in understanding the market for corporate control of listed family firms in Poland. Practical implications: Understanding the reaction by family firms to takeover bids requires recognition that there is a tradeoff between financial and SEW considerations, not just financial gains and losses. Originality/value: The case study demonstrates the importance of SEW to family firms and suggests that the balance of power in takeovers on the Polish stock market rests with incumbent management.

This study explores two ownership issues in private family firms. First, we investigate the relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance, and postulate that this relationship in private family firms is more complex than the inverted "U" relationship found in public family firms. Second, we predict a potential moderating effect of the second largest owner, who may exert a monitoring role on family CEOs. We focus on private family firms as recent studies show that private family firms have distinct features compared to public family firms, and that findings documented in public family firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but much less studied, private family firms. We have applied agency theory to develop the two hypotheses, used secondary data on a large sample of private family firms, utilized an adjusted conventional quadratic technique to test the hypotheses, and validated the findings using a second method of piecewise linear specification. The results show that the non-linear relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance is more complicated than the often-documented inverted "U" shape from public firms. Meanwhile, the second largest owner with a high enough ownership stake can impose a positive moderating effect by mitigating potential agency problems caused by family CEOs.

In this study, the effect of ownership structure characteristics namely government ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership, upon non-financial Omani firms performance (ROA) for the years 2012-2014 was examined. To achieve the study objective, the researcher obtained 81 sample firms in order for the above relationship to be tested. Sampling was taken from the firm's annual reports for three years. A total of 243 firms were selected, 81 for each year. For the purpose of testing the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, multiple regression analysis was employed. The study aims to fill the gap in extant literature regarding the ownership structure-firm performance relationship in Oman, a developing nation. The findings showed a positive and significant relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership, and firm performance (ROA). Some recommendations for future studies were provided prior to concluding the work.

Purpose: Since joint venture experience obtained from inward FDI may create a positive or negative impact on ownership mode choice, it is difficult to predict its direct impact. The purpose of this paper is to combine the organizational learning and agency perspectives to find whether CEO power can moderate the effect of inward joint venture experience. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 337 foreign entries conducted by 77 Chinese firms during 1998-2008, this study has tested some interaction effects of inward joint venture experience and CEO power measures. Findings: The author finds that inward joint venture experience interacts with CEO ownership and CEO duality, respectively, to have a negative impact on the selection of high-equity mode. Originality/value: This study contributes to entry mode literature by finding that inward (but not merely outward) FDI experience can influence entry mode choices and by combining agency theory and the organizational learning perspective to solve the theoretical conflicts created by the two opposite effects of a FDI experience.

In this paper we analyze the relationship between conformity to executive remuneration standards, corporate ownership, and the level and structure of CEO compensation for large European listed companies in the years 2007 and 2010. We show that controlled corporations conform to executive remuneration standards less than widely held firms. We also show that weaker compliance is associated with lower CEO pay and more cash-based incentive structures. We interpret this "conformity gap" from the perspective of individual firms and from a societal perspective, with the aim to contribute to frame the policy questions concerning executive pay at controlled corporations. Different policy implications depend on whether the conformity gap reflects a lower need for managerial incentives, given the monitoring by controlling shareholders, or the latter's willingness to extract private benefits of control. We argue in this paper that the former hypothesis prevails, so that regulators should abstain from increasing the level of enforcement of executive remuneration standards.

This paper examines how free cash flow and equity concentration are associated with agency costs, and how they influence the profitability of insurance firms listed on the Saudi Stock Market. The results indicate that equity concentration has no significant impact on agency costs, free cash flow has no significant impact on agency costs and agency costs have no significant impact on firm's profitability. The findings of this study do not show any evidence to support the agency theory among insurance firms listed on the Saudi Stock Market. (c) Haitham Nobanee, Jaya Abraham, 2017.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

While prior research has generally shown a positive price reaction to voluntary declarations of compliance with codes of corporate governance, this is the first paper to examine how investors react to the release of mandatory corporate governance reports. Positive reactions to declarations of compliance are generally interpreted in terms of signalling effects for those companies more committed with transparency. However, once corporate governance reports are mandatory, such signalling effects make no sense anymore. In the current context, the market would react according to the relevance of the information conveyed by the report. While prior related research has examined market reactions only through the behaviour of returns, we use three indicators: returns, price volatility and trading volumes. Our main result would be the lack of a significant market reaction to the release of corporate governance reports. This finding is robust as it is reported for each indicator of market reaction. However, for some subsamples of firms we show some weak reactions in the lines suggested by the agency theory. Our results might have some implications for regulators and policy makers when designing corporate governance regulations. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores whether the separation of ownership (by shareholders) and control (by managers) in firms is an essential determinant of the valuation effect of joint ventures (JVs). This is achieved by examining the efficacy of incentive alignment mechanisms and their contingency effects. Based on a sample of 963 U.S. firms' JV investments, the results show that poor JV performance is linked to lower levels of executive ownership and reduced equity compensation. The possibility of managers acting for their own self-interest in corporate JV investments is further supported by the stronger positive performance effect of incentive alignment mechanisms documented when firms have a higher level of free cash flow or undertake JVs in unrelated business domains. Both performance measures of short-run announcement effects and long-run stock returns yield similar results. Our results underscore the importance of governing executives' self-interested actions in their JV engagements. (c) 2017

In light of the need to develop mechanisms of control, protection, and transparency regarding the relationships between principal and agent, and with the aim of eliminating or reducing the agency problem, corporate governance has emerged. Based on Agency Theory, separation of ownership and control of activities derives from the complexity of organizations. In this context, this study aims to analyze the relationship between dimensions of complexity and corporate governance in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), in which contingency factors might influence organizational characteristics. The investigation gathers data from a sample of 162 companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA. The following statistical tests were used in the data analysis: Factor Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression, Correspondence Analysis, and Correlation Analysis. For measuring complexity, contingency variables such as age, size, diversification, and internationalization were adopted; and, to assess corporate governance, a representative index of the adoption of good governance practices was used. The results show that organizational complexity is explained by the size and diversification variables, whereas operational complexity is explained by the size, diversification, and internationalization variables. It was observed that in the two dimensions of complexity - organizational and operational - corporate governance was influenced by the diversification, internationalization, and age variables, with the latter involving an inverse relationship. It is concluded that companies displaying more complexity, in its two dimensions, record a higher level of corporate governance, which confirms the research hypothesis.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of managerial education levels on the wealth effect at the time of investment announcements, by testing two competitive hypotheses: the agency theory-based overinvestment hypothesis vs the Q-theory-based organizational legitimacy hypothesis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors construct the sample by hand-collecting the announcement dates of capital investments from major newspapers published in Taiwan from 2006 to 2014. The authors then use the event study methodology to estimate cumulative abnormal returns at the time of investments announcements to measure the wealth effect. Finally, the authors examine the wealth effect for capital-investing firms with higher managerial education vs those with lower managerial education. The authors also conduct a cross-sectional regression to test the relation between the wealth effect of capital investment and managerial education. Findings: The empirical results indicate that the wealth effect at the time of investment announcements is less favorable for firms with better-educated managers; this negative relation is mitigated for firms with higher institutional ownership and is aggravated for family-controlled firms; and the overall findings are supported by the agency theory-based overinvestment hypothesis, suggesting that higher managerial education lead to greater managerial optimism/overconfidence, which in turn increases the likelihood of overinvestment and implies a less favorable wealth effect associated with capital investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by proposing a new, unexplored stock market's reaction channel through which managerial education signals adverse information about potential overinvestment behavior, even though many studies suggests that managerial education serves as an indication of knowledge/capability and improves firm performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to present case study evidence on the changes in the relations between chief executive officers (CEOs) of large firms and shareholders in the past three decades of the twentieth century. In line with insights from agency theory, the CEOs have experienced increased scrutiny from their principals, the shareholders. This development has affected financial communication and investor relations as well as stock market prices. Design/methodology/approach: The Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV in the transition period of 1971-2001 has been studied using publicly available disclosures and stock market prices. A descriptive case study approach is combined with event study methodology. Findings: It was observed that the increased emphasis on shareholder interests has affected the interactions between Philips' respective CEOs and the shareholders' reactions to strategic decisions as measured by stock price changes. Around the beginning of the twenty-first century, clarity and openness in CEO communication was the norm and deviations were punished with volatile stock prices. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on publicly available data. Originality/value: The case study of Philips can be extrapolated to other exchange-listed firms in the late twentieth century, which faced changed expectations about the role of the CEO, investor relations and the CEO's accountability toward shareholders. This transition is relevant not only as a historical observation, but also as a background to studies in finance and management about top management and financial markets.

In this study, we examine the effects of corporate governance practices on financial performance of Pakistani listed firms. On the bases of agency theory, MM theorem, and theory of firm, we suggest that corporate governance effects firm performance directly as well as indirectly via mediation of capital structure and dividend policy. The model was tested using a cross-lagged analysis of 100 non-financial firms with the structural equation modeling (SEM). The study concludes that corporate governance improves financial performance by exploiting capital structure and dividend policy. The findings of this study, highlights the importance of corporate governance practices for peer firms to restructure their debt and dividend policies for the enhancement of their financial performance.

This article examines the association between the equity concentration and agency costs as well as the impact of agency costs on performance of non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). These relations are examined by using dynamic panel data and a two-step robust system estimation for the period 2010-2013. The study uses three proxy variables to measure agency costs. The results show that the equity concentration has no significant impact on agency costs, and the agency costs have no significant impact on firms' performance. In addition, the study shows no evidence to support the agency theory in non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). This study provides a better understanding of the association between equity concentration, agency costs and a firm's performance. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

This paper extends Jensen and Meckling's agency cost theory. A clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values. This extension incorporates Alchian and Demsetz's view of the firm, wherein firm values increase when managers are employed. It is then sub-optimal for owner-managers to directly expropriate non-pecuniary benefits through the firm as in Jensen and Meckling. It is instead Pareto optimal that owner-managers who seek to expropriate non-pecuniary benefits do so using the firm's higher value, and trading it for the non-pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of family control and management in the quality of accounting information in Brazilian companies, with a focus on timeliness. The sample consisted of 72 Brazilian companies and 1,656 observations from 2008 to 2013. The results show that family-controlled companies are quicker to recognize good news related to the price of the respective stock. On the other hand, family managed companies showed low accounting timeliness in relation to recognition of good news. The findings contribute to the agency theory and the literature on family firms and confirm that such companies experience fewer agency problems arising from conflicts between majority and minority shareholders. In addition, the agency conflicts between the management and minority shareholders can be compounded by the recognition of good news not being in family managed firms. (c) 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

Purpose: Shareholders and managers can work in a hierarchy in which principals attempt to control the actions of agents to achieve the wealth objective. Alternatively, shareholders and managers can work together as a cooperative team in which shareholders provide financial capital and managers provide human capital. The authors aim to examine the different implications for value creation provided by the two approaches. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the literature on the value implications of the incomplete contracting framework and control arrangements in principal-agent hierarchies, the authors identify deviations from optimal outcomes and suggest solutions. Findings: The review indicates that a cooperative framework has some advantages over the hierarchical model. The stability of human capital and the relationship between managers and shareholders can be enhanced when shareholders provide capital in increments which vest over time and latitude for renegotiation of agreements is built into contracts. Practical implications: By surrendering control using stock options programmes, managers are free to invest in relationship-specific assets. Shareholders can control the provision of capital by withdrawing investment if insufficient returns are realized, i.e. if stock options do not meet vesting requirements. The market can then be left to do its work. Originality/value: This paper provides an original review of literature on cooperation and hierarchies in the shareholder-manager relationship and proposes solutions to identified deviations from optimal outcomes.

The literature on outside directors explains that those who focus on monitoring roles are more likely to get disincentives, such as 'not to be reappointed', than those who emphasize advisory roles with ingratiating behavior. This study, in contrast, suggests that the probability of outside director's reappointment is more affected by his/her disciplinary behaviors regardless of whether he/she seeks for monitoring or advisory roles. Further, the negative effects of disciplinary behaviors are not much influenced by his/her personal connections on the board. With the survey data on outside directors in Korea, this study classifies outside director's behaviors in two dimensions: disciplinary vs. favorable in addition to monitoring and advisory roles. The empirical analysis supports that contrary to agency theory and social networks framework, firms utilize outside directors according to their behavioral characteristics rather than assumed roles, in which the moderating effects of personal connections are not as large as expected.

The paper reviews theories of corporate governance with regard to financial institutions, in particular, the banking sector. The conventional theory underlying corporate governance does not suggest a differential approach to its application among different organisations. While many organisations subscribe to some form of corporate governance, the manner the principles are applied vary from one organisation to another, one sector to another and one country to another. Financial institutions are a special category of corporations because of the various services they provide to the sectors of the economy, their failure of which can be costly to society (e.g. the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009). The negative externalities that can affect households and firms when there is a breakdown in the provision of financial services arguably justify regulation. Thus, the governance mechanisms that safeguard the interests of shareholders in conventional corporate structures might not be adequate in the case of financial institutions. Cognisant that there is little research regarding corporate governance of financial institutions including Islamic banks, this paper reviews contemporary literature on the subject matter and provides further insights.

Corporate entrepreneurship requires senior executives to evaluate proposals for investment and projects from corporate entrepreneurs. Properties of technology make this evaluation difficult, creating a knowledge gap. Whether through opportunism, overconfidence, and overconfidence, corporate entrepreneurs are likely to induce overinvestment in projects, perhaps at the expense of corporate goals. In this paper we analyze this problem using the tools of agency theory, and identify a solution, staged commitment, used and useful in many areas of business. (c) 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Important corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership concentration and debt used by the large firms can affect firm performance and value in developed markets. The mixed findings - which are non-conclusive in the literature - pertaining to these relationships pose questions about the exact nature of the relationships between these mechanisms and firm value. Moreover, the mixed findings in the literature have resulted in the endogeneity issue of the former becoming central to discussions in corporate governance and corporate finance studies. The research in this book focuses on the dynamic endogeneity issue to investigate whether this issue influences the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms based on agency theory. The study investigates this issue through three different advanced econometric models and tests based on agency theory: two-way fixed effects (FE) and the two-step system known as the generalised method of moments (GMM). The book concludes that dynamic endogeneity is not a serious issue in influencing the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms. These models can be applied to other countries for investigating similar corporate governance and finance issues. (c) 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

CEO duality motivates executives to boost financial performance and withhold unfavourable news, which increases future stock price crashes. Using China's listed firms from 2004 to 2014 as the sample, we present evidence CEO duality exerts positive effects on stock price crash risk. Moreover, the positive effect of CEO duality on crash risk is strengthened when the firms have relatively higher R&D expenditure, lower market competition, and lower analyst coverage.

Corruption is one of the most worrying problems currently in Spain. Its damage to the public economy has become visible and unquestionable. Moreover, there is a sense of impunity for the corrupt that de-legitimizes the democratic system and is provoking the political disaffection of many Spaniards. However, there has been some civic response that calls for reforms and there is a proliferation of proposals for measures to combat corruption. These are measures of very diverse nature and scope. This generates a sense of chaos and improvisation. We consider that it is only apparent chaos, that behind these proposals there is a logic that arises from the particular perspective and concern of the one who proposes it. The object of study is the Spanish case of public corruption, although we do not have a precise definition nor with universal validity. It is logical because the phenomena of corruption are complex, multidimensional, with a strong moral burden and each one approaches them in their own way according to their analytical interest. Here we do not propose another one of definition, we are enough with the definition umbrella habitual: "abuse of power in private benefit". In the Spanish case, although corruption itself is not typified, there are crimes of "corrupt type". However, we have expanded the subject of study beyond the crimes of corruption typified in the law, incorporating other forms of "abuse of power (public) in private benefit" that may even they be legal. They are not crimes that a court can judge, but they are "bad manners" of doing things that citizens can punish with their vote, if they want. The approach taken to deal with this issue is based on the fact that the relationship between the citizen and the politician is of "principal-agent" and that is developed in a market of "lemons". The Agency Theory, although developed for the private sector, serves to address the issue of delegated responsibility in the field of public policies. In an advanced democracy, each voter decides who has her trust to management their priority interests from public institutions. From that moment on, the citizen (principal) is in the hands of the politician (agent) until the next elections (electoral cycle), during which the agent has to account for his management to the principal. Then the citizen can reaffirm his confidence in a certain politician, his questioning or his withdrawal. But it is not easy to make that decision because the information is asymmetric: the politician knows what's really behind his story, but the voter not, he only has signals. This refers us to the market of "lemons". The voter knows that he participates in a political market of lemons, in which the candidates, to win, promise beyond their pos- sibilities and hide their limitations, even lie. The voter's responses to a politician he distrusts may be mainly: give him another chance (loyalty), claim him to do better (voice) or trust another politician (exit). When he does not trust any politician the reactions are the same but the consequences not; in this case the exit is of the whole political market (disaffection), the voice calls for changes but not in the political one but in the functioning of the whole system (for example, transparency). We are especially interested in the voice, particularly the one that claims less public corruption (both typified and paracorruption). The objective of this work is to order the different proposals in some way that allows us to obtain an overview. To this end we have considered that public corruption is a crime, albeit with specific traits, and we have resorted to Criminology. In particular, we have integrated the Theory of Rational Expectations (TRE) and the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) as working hypothesis. The first allows us to make explicit the rationality of the corrupt. The second allows us to incorporate three key elements: victims, guardians and crime scene. We have adapted TRE+RAT to our object of study: crime is corruption, criminals are corrupt, guardians are those who face corruption, victims are citizens in general and change of routines or lifestyle is, in the Spanish case, the political-institutional reform initiated with the Transition. Combining both theories we have four basic elements (delinquent, victim, guardian and scene) that explain the most recommended criminal (preventive) policy measures: discourage potential criminals (motivated offenders), more trained guardians (capable guardianship), restructure crime scenarios to reduce exposure to the risk of crime and educate potential victims to be more careful. Starting from a review (not exhaustive) of the proposals made both for the particular situation of Spain and for this phenomenon in general, has analyzed the nature of each of them. This analysis has allowed to classify them according to which of the previous elements is affected. In the case of the corrupt (criminals) four types of proposals have been identified: those that increase the opportunity cost of performing a corrupt act, those that reduce the income obtained with it, those that increase their costs and those that increase the sanctions. With regard to the guardians, four main types have been identified: those proposing more/new guardians and those seeking to increase their effectiveness both police and judicial and deterrent. Regarding the crime scenario, the cycle of public policy, three types have been identified: those that aim to improve this scenario, but also to improve political procedures and actors involved in the cycle. Finally, with regard to the victims, measures have been identified which seek to increase their knowledge of the crime, their ability to fight it and their willingness to act against it. The result obtained is a kind of map that allows to locate the anti-corruption proposals in fourteen different territories, articulated around the cycle of public policies. This map can be a useful tool for the analysis of anti-corruption policies, in particular it facilitates: * discovering territories that are left out of the anti-corruption measures (unprotected) and others that are overloaded with measures; * identify inconsistencies and incompatibilities between different proposals; * detect vicious circles of corruption (more harmful) and virtuous circles of corruption reduction (more effective in the fight against this crime); * assess which territories are the most appropriate to concentrate the resources aimed at combating corruption and in which may have an excess; * to use a common language in the interdisciplinary discussion, since proposing a map that integrates the political, economic, juridical and sociological visions; * improve synchronization between measures that have different maturing times, that is, the political times.

Research Summary: We investigate whether and how family ownership and management influence firms' internationalization strategies in an emerging economy in which family firms are dominant. Anchoring on the willingness and ability framework and drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective and agency theory, we theorize how the heterogeneity among family firms in their ownership structures, concentration, and family involvement in management shapes the firms' internationalization strategies. We also theorize how certain contingencies, such as the presence of foreign institutional ownership and family management, moderate the relationship between family ownership and internationalization strategy. We test our predictions by using a proprietary, longitudinal panel dataset of 303 leading family firms from India and find support for most of our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Internationalization has emerged as a dominant strategy for firms in a globally interconnected world. We observe that ownership structure and management have significant bearing on internationalization strategies of family firms, as family owners and managers are more averse to internationalization. Family firms' aversion to internationalize is more pronounced when families can exercise greater control on firms' actions through the combined effect of higher family ownership (primarily through strategic control) and family's participation in management (through strategic, administrative, and operational control). However, certain contingencies, such as the higher ownership of foreign institutions and presence of professional managers, help business families improve their understanding of international markets, reduce the fear of the unknown, and better appreciate the benefits of internationalization, thereby aiding greater internationalization of family firms.

Management researchers have investigated how corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate social responsibility (CSR). The previous literature has been largely based on agency theory, which emphasizes the roles of effective monitoring and incentive alignment, but the empirical evidence has been mixed. This inconsistency may result from the assumption that each governance mechanism functions independently, even though they interact with one another to affect CSR. On the basis of a perspective of bundle of governance mechanisms, we examined whether multiple governance mechanisms act as complements or substitutes for each other in promoting CSR. Using a panel sample of U.S. firms for the years 2004 to 2010, we found that multiple governance mechanisms mainly act as substitutes to promote CSR. Our findings suggest that a similar level of CSR can be achieved with different combinations of governance mechanisms. Our study contributes to the fields of both corporate governance and CSR in theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Based on a large international sample, we examine the effects of CSR on the cost of equity under different levels of investor protection. In countries where investor protection is strong (poor), our results show that the cost of equity falls (rises) when a firm invests in CSR. Our findings are robust to alternative variable definitions, sample selection, analyst forecast bias, and various methodological specifications. We also demonstrate that the investor base channel is able to explain different outcomes regarding the relation between CSR and the cost of equity, and we derive implications for both financial practice and public policy.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effects of firm performance and corporate governance on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, Pakistan. Using a more robust Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach for a sample of non-financial firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange over the period 2005-2012, we find that both current- and previous-year accounting performances has positive influence on CEO compensation. However, stock market performance does not appear to have a positive impact on executive compensation. We further find that ownership concentration is positively related with CEO compensation, indicating some kind of collusion between management and largest shareholder to get personal benefits. Inconsistent with agency theory, CEO duality appears to have a negative influence, while board size and board independence have no convincing relationship with CEO compensation, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing CEO entrenchment. The results of dynamic GMM model suggest that CEO pay is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The resource-based view posits that firms achieve competitive advantage from value creation through firm-specific investments held by key stakeholders: employees, suppliers, and customers. Shareholder-dominant (agency) theory holds that all residual income claimant rights belong to shareholders, circumscribing other key stakeholders' ability to appropriate value from their investment. However, recent enhancements to stakeholder theory grounded in property rights suggest that such stakeholders may need protection for implicit residual claims. A central purpose of this article is to build a model of the protection devices used to ensure these implicit rights. Individual ex ante devices such as stakeholder ownership only partially incentivize stakeholders' firm-specific investments because they are subject to two types of uncertainties--behavioral and environmental--and individual devices aimed at reducing one type of uncertainty may exacerbate the other. We therefore expand on efforts to establish a stakeholder theory of strategic management by proposing an integrated model of protection devices, which seeks to overcome the incentive dilemma in reducing both uncertainties by reducing barriers to stakeholder firm-specific investment. Our model also explores the conflicts and complementarities associated with device implementation. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities associated with our model. Q Academy of Management Review 2018

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of political connections on earnings quality by simultaneously controlling the firm characteristics; to test whether Pakistani firms' ownership, specifically family ownership, plays a significant role in political connections-earnings quality association; to draw a conclusion about the agency theory in the context of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was used to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership on the earnings quality of listed firms in Pakistan. The study uses historical data from 238 active non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during the period of 2009-2015. The final data set comprises more than 1,600 firm-year observations from ten major non-financial industry classifications. To enhance the robustness of the empirical relationship, the study used several proxies of earnings quality in conjunction with robust regression methods and diagnostic checks. Findings: The present study's findings are consistent with the findings of the studies on agency theory previous literature, where politically connected firms have significantly lower earnings quality as compared to non-connected firms. The results also indicate that family firms have superior earnings quality than non-family-controlled firms. Furthermore, family ownership moderates the negative influence of political connections on earnings quality. This implies that family ownership diminishes the costs of political connections and improves the earnings quality of the firm. Originality/value: This study is different from previous research in three respects. First, it examines whether family ownership concentration has a moderating influence on the relationship between political connections and earnings quality. Second, it uses a robust methodology and extensive data set to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership concentration on earnings quality. Further, this study is the first to analyze the nexus between financial reporting quality and the political business environment in the context of Pakistan. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper sheds light on the incongruent findings concerning the relationship between family involvement and firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR). While prior studies have mainly taken the perspective of families' socioemotional wealth preservation, we approach this relationship from the perspective of behavioral agency theory, highlighting the important role played by CEOs' family memberships. Specifically, we posit that family firms are more likely to invest in CSR when their CEOs are members of the controlling families. Furthermore, we examine how family firms can employ long-term incentives to encourage non-family CEOs to act in the interests of the controlling families to preserve SEW and thus enhancing family firms' CSR performance. We tested our hypotheses using hand-collected data of family firms included in the S&P 500 index, in the period of 2003-2010. The empirical findings support our hypotheses that (a) family firms with family members as the CEOs have better CSR performance and (b) family firms tend to provide a high level of long-term incentives to non-family than family CEOs. In addition, long-term incentives strongly motivate CEOs to improve firms' CSR performance, regardless of their family memberships. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

In this study, we draw upon insights from agency theory to examine the impact of managerial political ties on cost of debt and also to explore whether corporate governance mediates this impact. We hypothesize that political ties reduce financial reporting quality, disclosure of non-financial information and board independence, and are therefore associated with higher interest rates. We also hypothesize that the negative effect of political ties on the cost of debt will be stronger if firms borrow from privately-owned banks versus government-owned banks. Using data from Ghana, we find support for our direct and moderation hypotheses; political ties are associated with high interest rates and poor corporate governance. However, we do not find evidence of mediation. Altogether, the findings reveal the dark side of political connections and highlight the cost of political embeddedness in emerging credit markets.

In much of the developing world, families represent the dominant form of firm ownership. This study investigates how this influences equity ownership strategies when firms venture abroad. Drawing on agency theory and institutional theory, we investigate the direct effect of board composition and family ownership on the equity-based ownership strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in their affiliates, and how institutional distance may moderate this. Examining foreign affiliates of listed Turkish MNEs, we find that a high ratio of independent directors is negatively linked to levels of equity ownership of MNE affiliates. We also find that a high ratio of inside directors on the board is positively associated with the equity stake of MNEs in their affiliates. The significant interaction effect between board composition, family ownership and institutional distance helps explain the unexpectedly weak effects of institutional distance. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to provide a twofold empirical comparison: first, a comparison between the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on agency costs proxies and firm performance measures, and second, this comparison was used before and after the 2008 financial crisis, capturing two different economic states. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression methods were applied to two data sets of non-financial firms incorporated in the FTSE ALL-Share index over the period 2005-2011. Findings: The results provide evidence that not all mechanisms lead to lower agency conflicts and/or higher firm performance. Ownership identity has a significant impact and the role of the governance mechanisms changes with the changes in the economic conditions surrounding the firm. Research limitations/implications: The results lend support to the notion that forcing a certain code of practice on firms to follow could compel them to move away from conflict reduction governance structures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comparison of empirical evidence for the impact of board characteristics and ownership identity on agency costs and firm performance by using a comprehensive set of corporate governance mechanisms. This comparison challenges the prior studies that use performance as an indirect proxy for lower agency costs. Additionally, it compares the impact of the governance mechanisms during two different economic conditions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Radical innovation is critical for firms to enhance their competitiveness. Whether they can achieve it, however, depends on organizational factors, including the corporate governance of the firm. In emerging economies in which shareholder protection is weak, large shareholders are widely used as an efficient governance mechanism to reduce agency problems. The literature on agency theory contains conflicting arguments regarding the role of large shareholders in firm innovation performance and has underestimated the role of social relationships between large shareholders and managers in determining the firm's innovation performance. By applying a stewardship theory perspective, this article argues that the characteristics of the relationship between large shareholders (owners) and managers, manifested as trust and shared goals, may explain variations in a firm's radical innovation. Drawing on data from 174 Chinese firms with large shareholders, our results show that trust has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm radical innovation, whereas shared goals exhibit a positive linear relationship with radical innovation. Shared goals further moderate the nonlinear effect of trust on radical innovation. Trust is almost negatively related to firm radical innovation when there is a low level of shared goals. However, when there is a high level of shared goals, the relationship between trust and firm radical innovation is first positive, then plateaus, and finally becomes negative. These findings advance our understanding of the role of the relationship between large shareholders and managers as a driver of radical innovation and contribute to the innovation literature by providing a nuanced understanding of the key factors that influence the effects of the social aspects of governance on firm radical innovation.

This paper examines the effects of board composition and monitoring on the credit risk in the UK banking sector. The study finds CEO duality, pay and board independence to have a positive and significant effect on credit risk of the UK banks. However, board size and women on board have a negative and significant influence on credit risk. Further analysis using sub-samples divided into pre-financial crisis, during the financial crisis and post crisis reinforce the robustness of our findings. Overall, the paper sheds light on the effectiveness of the within-firm monitoring arrangement, particularly, the effects of CEO power and board independence on credit risk decisions thereby contributing to the agency theory.

Purpose: Agency theory suggests that divergences will occur when a principal, e.g. client, and agent e.g. a project manager, interests are different in the execution of a project. The purpose of this paper is to explore if the agency theory can explain the subtleties integral to the behaviours and relationships between players delivering a public-private-partnership (PPP) in the context of an international development (ID) project. The intra-/interpersonal dynamics include governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private commercial service providers. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide evidence from a case study of the testing of a Road Safety Toolkit in Kenya to explore several propositions. Design/methodology/approach: Extant literature identified application of the agency theory, and the development of a conceptual framework. A case study describing an ID project was used to validate the propositions prior to the expansion of a research instrument for data collection in the field. Findings: Through the lens of the agency theory and the limitations imposed by exploring a series of propositions, several insightful conclusions have been derived from the case. ID projects have particular nuisances that make them unique when compared to the majority of commercial applications. An added dimension and level of complexity is a consequence of the PPP incorporating government, NGOs and private corporations. The case exemplified the need for PPP ID projects to build on partner networks to influence and disseminate outcomes. Some agency problems were far less prominent than would normally be seen in a commercial project. Research limitations/implications: The methodologies presented in this paper need to be adapted and practiced in different kinds of ID projects in order to get confirmatory analytical results. The limitations imposed by the use of the single case, whilst drawing insightful conclusions, would necessitate greater testing in the field. Practical implications: Although the problems of the agency theory are well researched in the operations management literature, there is limited application to ID projects and no previous research within the context of a PPP. Therefore, this work is important for greater understanding of the specific issues associated with project delivery of an ID. Social implications: Conflicting goals between principals and agents are common for organisations, which in turn affect inter-relationships on an international footing. The agency theory has had little attention in the project management field, yet is fundamental to relationships and communication. Originality/value: There has been little research that explores the agency theory in the context of a PPP involving governments, NGOs and private commercial service providers, executed as an ID project. This work, therefore, exhibits new and novel findings. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of some corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation on audit fees in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study population consists of 540 observations and 90 listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during the years 2009-2014. The statistical model used in this study is a multivariate regression model; besides, the statistical technique used to test the hypotheses proposed in this research is panel data. Findings: The changes in the value of a CEO's own firm stock option portfolio, in thousands of rials (Iran's currency), for a 0.01 change in stock return volatility and stock price are defined as Vega and Delta, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is a positive association between audit fees and delta, but not Vega; this means that a fee premium is linked to CEO Delta incentives. The findings show that Iranian companies pay more audit fees when they give managers more rewards. In addition, the results show that there is not a significant relationship between fees resulting from audit risk and Delta and Vega incentives of the board. Inconsistent with agency theory, the authors found that the independence of board members did not have any effect on audit fees. As a final point, the outcomes of the paper demonstrate that managers who invest in companies under their own management do not have any impact on the amount of audit fee. To put it another way, there is not any significant connection between the board ownership and audit fees. Practical implications: This is one of the most important studies that simultaneously surveys the impacts of corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation in the Iranian audit market. The results of this study will reveal more than the role of corporate governance mechanisms for society and users of financial statements because as tools on the CEO actions, they always have to pay attention to the implementation of corporate principles in the economic entity' operation. Originality/value: The present study has examined the relationship between two cases of corporate governance mechanisms named the board independence and the board ownership with audit fees in a country where, to the authors' knowledge as in most other developing markets, such a relationship has not been a subject of empirical research. Moreover, the use of a two-dimensional measure of executive compensation, namely, Delta and Vega incentives, primarily considering research undertaken in an emerging market, as a valuable contribution may be observed.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance, with particular reference to the role of independent directors on boards and audit committees, and media coverage on corporate transparency and disclosure. In addition, the paper also investigates the role of the media on independent directors' behaviours towards corporate transparency and disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the well-developed two-step system generalised method of moments approach on a sample of 99 Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) listed financial firms over the period 2007-2012. Findings: The empirical analysis shows that media and independent directors on audit committees play a significant positive role in line with agenda setting and agency theories in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. On the contrary, the boards' independent directors are risk-averse and hold the information to protect their reputation. Nevertheless, the study does not find any significant influence of media coverage on independent directors' behaviours in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. Practical implications: The findings provide some useful insight into cost benefits analysis of media coverage towards an understanding of independent directors' behaviours for promoting transparency and disclosure in financial sector. Moreover, the study findings can be useful for both shareholders and stakeholders in taking decisions about firm activities. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that proposed and tested a multi-level framework for corporate transparency and disclosure practices. In addition, this study is also among the very few studies that use financial sectors as a sample, in particular, and media coverage, specifically, thus adding some value to the limited literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of Islamic banks (IBs) product and services disclosure (PSD). Design/methodology/approach: A computer-based content analysis is run upon the annual reports for a sample of 78 IBs operating in 11 countries from 2004 to 2012 to find the number of product and services statements. The levels and trends of PSD are identified. A regression analysis to identify the factors affecting PSD in IBs is also used. Findings: The findings suggest that there has been a significant improvement of PSD over time. The results show a positive association between PSD and Shariah board size, board size, chief executive officer (CEO) tenure, duality in position, blockholders and investment account holders. However, they show a negative association between PSD and institutional ownership. In addition, it appears that board independence does not affect significantly banks' PSD. It is also found that the bank performance, bank age, leverage, listing, adoption of international financial reporting standards, adoption of Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions and country transparency index have a positive effect on the PSD. Originality/value: This study offers an original contribution to corporate disclosure literature by being the first to develop and investigate PSD for a large sample of IBs during a long period of time. It links P&S with bank corporate governance characteristics. The findings have many important policy implications. More specifically, this paper encourages regulators in the studied countries to improve corporate governance mechanisms in their Islamic banking systems through the optimization of ownership structure, CEO's characteristics and the board's characteristics, to promote PSD. Moreover, the findings support the theoretical predictions of the generalized agency theory. This study's empirical evidence enhances the understanding of the corporate social responsibility disclosure environment in general and the PSD environment in particular for IBs. This study is the first one that measures PSD in the annual reports for a large cross-countries sample of IBs during a long period of time. It is also the first one that links PSD with IBs corporate governance mechanisms. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in non-financial firms in Malaysia. Managerial ownership and incentive compensation are used as proxies to reflect corporate governance conduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data set to analyse 286 non-financial listed companies on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2010-2012. Tax disclosure was gathered from the financial statements, particularly in the consolidated of tax expenses. Tax disclosure was measured using modified effective tax rate reconciling items. Multivariate statistical analyses were run on the sample data. Findings: This study finds that managerial ownership and incentive compensation do not significantly influence tax disclosure. On the other hand, it is found that there are significant positive associations between each of firm size and industry dummy, and tax disclosure. This means that company-specific characteristics are important factors affecting corporate tax disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the work of previous studies by suggesting that the signalling theory and the agency theory are the main theories concerned with tax disclosure and corporate governance. The authors add an additional appreciation of the contribution of corporate governance from the interested parties' tax disclosure evaluation in the Malaysian environment. Practical implications: The evidence found by this study has important policy and practical knowledge implications for the authorities, researchers, decisionmakers and firm managers. The findings provide them with some relevant insights on the importance of corporate governance practices from the companies' perspectives and contribute to the discussion of who verifies and deduces from tax disclosure directed by companies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine the influence of the corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in a developing nation like Malaysia. Although this paper focuses on a single country, it contributes significantly to the debate about tax disclosure in relation to "comply or explain", as suggested in the Code of Corporate Governance. This study shows that companies are trying to avoid as far as possible disclosing tax-related information. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although agency theory implies that greater parent ownership can help mitigate agency conflict, principal-principal conflicts could arise among controlling and other minority shareholders. This study investigates corporate governance in publicly listed subsidiary firms after the establishment of small-cap markets, which is a unique setting in Japan. The results show that parent control has a negative relationship to dividend payout and firm profitability. However, parent control enhances sales growth, which is not consistent with parent control exploitation. Foreign shareholders moderate the conflict between parent firms and other shareholders related to dividends and firm profitability. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Related party transactions have become a key issue as a result of recent financial scandals. This study examines whether firms use related party transactions for earnings management, and then, whether they try to minimize detection through the format of related party transactions disclosure. Firstly, we analyze the association between related party transactions structure (types and parties involved) and the probability of reporting small earnings increase. Related party transactions may have significant impact on, and implications for, earnings management. According to the agency theory, related party transactions are used opportunistically, while the efficient transaction hypothesis argues that related party transactions meet the economic needs of the business. We next investigate the association between the probability of reporting small earnings increases through related party transactions and disclosure quality. Disclosure quality should be studied in relation to impression management and investor attention; this approach takes account of the idea that earnings management behavior may influence the quality of disclosure as a possible way of lowering conflict of interest. In line with the agency theory, our findings show that revenue related party transactions are more likely to be used to manage earnings than other types of transaction; related party transactions with ultimate parents are associated with lower probability of reporting small earnings increases compared to operations with other related parties. Lastly, our results confirm that the decision to engage in earnings management is related to lower disclosure quality. (c) 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between corporate governance structures and stakeholder and shareholder value maximization perspectives in 267 African banks from 2006 to 2011. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the Prais-Winsten ordinary least squares and random effect regression models to explore this relationship to ensure consistency and efficiency in results. The data for this study were collected from Bankscope. Findings: The results of this study show that corporate governance structures such as CEO duality, nonexecutive members and extreme large board size lead to a reduction in both shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. However, audit independence and board size also promote both shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. Although gender diversity promotes profit maximization, it was not significant in any of the models estimated. The results further suggest that the same corporate governance structures promote and detract shareholder and stakeholder value maximization in Africa although the effect of corporate governance structures was weightier on shareholder value maximization confirming the agency theory. Practical implications: From these findings, bank management must pursue the institution of good corporate governance structures and avoid weak corporate governance structures to promote shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. Also equity holders may have to pay particular attention to corporate governance structures because they benefit the most from the institution of good corporate governance structures. Originality/value: This study explores and compares how corporate governance structures promote shareholder and stakeholder value maximization separately in African banks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first of such studies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This chapter reviews prior, so far inconclusive, research on the risk behavior of family firms. On the one hand, scholars assume risk-averse behavior of family firms based on agency theory and wealth concentration arguments. On the other hand, scholars predict that family firms are willing to take substantial financial risks to preserve their SEW. By integrating finance, management, and entrepreneurship literature, we show that different underlying definitions of "risk" are key for a better understanding of family firms' risk behavior and subsequent strategic decisions. We provide a conceptual model, highlight gaps in the existing literature, and propose fruitful areas for further research. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We investigate if agency theory effectively explains agency conflict in the context of a developing country namely, Pakistan. Utilising data from 26 semi-structured interviews, we found that in Pakistan, there is no variation in risk preferences of principals (minority shareholders) and agents (majority shareholders). We also found that remuneration packages and board independence are not effective tools for governing owner managers in Pakistan. Thus, policy makers must shift their focus from soft internal governance mechanisms of appropriate remuneration and board independence. We propose for a rigorous external audit function, and appointment of independent directors and external audit firms by regulator. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

Family involvement in corporate governance through ownership, management, and board membership presents a unique dilemma for understanding the strategic impetus and costs of entrenchment decisions. The presence of shared family ties and the family-centered goals of firm principals call to question the applicability of extant agency arguments regarding the nature and antecedents of managerial entrenchment. Exploring this, we develop and test a model of family firm-specific determinants (i.e., family ownership and family's involvement in management and governance) of entrenchment in publicly traded firms by drawing upon principal-principal agency theory. Findings of the empirical analysis of family owned S&P 500 firms suggest family firms are motivated to entrench managers when doing so supports the pursuit of family-centric goals. However, the extent to which entrenchment supports such goals varies at different levels of family ownership. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

This study investigates the relationship between agency costs and ownership structure for a sample of listed Italian companies to determine the impact of shareholder coalitions on agency costs. Using a balanced panel dataset of 1956 firm-year observations for the period 2002-2013, the results provide evidence that ownership concentration and debt play a limited role in monitoring agency costs, whereas the type of shareholder plays an important role in either mitigating or exacerbating agency costs. Family-controlled firms and coalitions among non-controlling shareholders seem helpful in reducing agency costs. The results suggest that coalitions among non-controlling shareholders both in family and non-family firms reduce agency costs. The findings also indicate that multiple blockholders play a key role as mediators. The paper provides a new perspective on assessing the role of agency costs in a bank-based, civil law country. The results enable one to better understand the impact of blockholders on agency costs and their interactions within family-controlled firms. The results also provide support for both the entrenchment effect and the alignment-of-interests hypothesis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Agency theory suggests that CEOs view dividends unfavorably because dividend payouts deprive them of the free cash flow they could otherwise exploit. Using Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer's (2011) CEO pay slice (CPS) to measure CEO power, we find that an increase in CEO power by one standard deviation decreases the probability of paying dividends by 17.48%. For dividend-paying firms, a rise in CEO power by one standard deviation reduces the size of dividend payouts by 5.91%. Share repurchases, however, are not influenced by CEO power, although they too take away the free cash flow from the CEO. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates how cash flow influences the levels of investment and dividends in the shipping industry. Using generalized least squares (GLS) regressions the study reports how free cash flow (FCF) of shipping firms of different sizes influence investment and dividends. Moreover, it shows the role of debt in financing investment. The paper finds that FCF is a determinant of investment and dividends. Greater FCF leads firms to increase investment and reduce dividends. The use of debt alleviates overinvestment. This paper illustrates how shipping firms allocate FCF. The paper verifies that the agency theory can explain behaviour of managers with respect to the investment strategy. (c) 2018 The Authors

Purpose: This paper aims to assess the risk reporting practices extent to which firm's and corporate governance characteristics explain risk-related disclosures (RRD) motivations across two European Latin countries (Portugal and Spain). Moreover, drawn on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory, this study also intends to assess whether the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on risk reporting is mediated by strategic/institutional legitimacy interests. Design/methodology/approach: From a sample of 60 non-finance Portuguese and Spanish companies with securities traded on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange market and on the Madrid stock exchange market, respectively, at December, 2011, the Corporate Governance reports and the "risk/risk management" sections of the Management reports included on consolidated annual reports for 2011 were manually content analysed, according to prior literature. Further, multiple linear regressions were used to assess the potential relationships between corporate governance mechanisms and risk reporting. The paper's theoretical framework draws on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory. To understand the risk reporting practices of Portuguese and Spanish non-finance listed companies, the paper conducts a content analysis of 60 consolidated annual reports for 2011. Findings: Results indicate that visible companies, operating in a country with a weaker legal environment, and during periods of financial distress disclose more discretionary RRD, basically to contextualize their negative outcomes. Some corporate governance mechanisms were crucial to improve risk information. Originality/value: The paper goes beyond prior literature work and assesses whether the theoretical framework grounded on agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspective and institutional theory is suitable in explaining RRD in an under-researched setting (European Latin countries, such as Portugal and Spain, with low agency costs and different corporate governance models). Moreover, the analysis embraces a wider and homogeneous range of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms and uses a period in which both countries were severely affected by a sovereign debt crisis with negative impacts on company's liquidity and financial risks. A research setting like this has not been studied hitherto. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Drawing from agency theory and the attention-based view of the firm, this study extends the understanding of the conditions under which CEO duality is negatively associated with board monitoring in a privately held firm context. Measuring monitoring in terms of board members' involvement in behavioral control, output control, and strategy control tasks (Huse), results show that CEO duality is significantly and negatively related only to the behavioral control task. In addition, we show that this negative effect is contingent on whether ownership is concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder as well as the type of controlling shareholder.

Proxy advisors are information intermediaries that enable shareholders to exercise their voting rights. While proxy advisors' influence is documented in market-based corporate governance systems, we know little about the corporate governance role of proxy advice in relationship-based governance systems. Drawing on agency theory and the comparative corporate governance literature, we theorize that shareholders are sensitive to the costs and benefits of monitoring by considering internal monitoring capabilities. We also theorize that relative to market-based corporate governance systems, proxy advice is both less influential and has lower predictive quality in relationship-based governance systems. We test our multilevel model using 13,497 voting results from 613 firms in 16 Western European countries and generally find support for our predictions. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Stewardship theory of corporate governance is a normative alternative to agency theory. This article argues that the stewardship behaviour of managers results in exemplary corporate governance practices when the espoused values of the firm are aligned with the enacted values. The case study method is used to prove this argument by studying corporate governance practices in a family-owned business group in India. The Murugappa Group is a 100-year-old family-owned business group, known for their ethical practices and currently managed by the fourth-generation family members, without undergoing any split. The espoused as well enacted values of the group are studied and corporate governance practices of the group firms analysed in this article. The article focuses on the governance structure of the group, its succession planning practices and the ownership structure. The analysis indicates that aligning the enacted values with the espoused value helped the group to adapt itself to the changing external economic environment and continue creating shareholder value, the essence of corporate governance.

Family business research typically views family firms using the frameworks developed for non-family businesses (e.g., agency theory, institutional theory). Thus, using an evolutionary perspective on family may help address gaps in the family business literature, particularly regarding deviance. In the current study, we use kin selection theory to predict that family members receive preferential treatment and this history of privileges can create entitlement and lead genetically-related employees to misuse company resources. Using an experimental vignette methodology and data from 161 people recruited from an online panel, we found that the participants' purported genetic relatedness to the owner of a business increased their theft intentions and decreased their expected severity of sanctions and likelihood of being reported. Biological sex moderated the relationships between genetic relatedness and theft intentions, as well as between expectations of punishment and theft intentions. Specifically, when females expected higher severity of sanctions or likelihood of whistleblowing, they were less likely to report theft intentions, compared to males. The results of this study suggest that family business owners should protect against theft by all employees, including genetic relatives. Future research using field samples would help provide context for these findings. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the effects of family firms on the corporate social performance of Korean firms and analyses how their effect varies depending on the presence of family CEOs or chaebols. Based on the agency theory, we find that family firms exhibit lower corporate social performance. In particular, there is no difference in the performance of related stakeholders, such as society, consumers, environment, and employees, compared to non-family firms, but corporate governance registers as low performance. We further find that family firms managed by family CEOs show lower corporate social performance, whereas chaebol firms show higher corporate social performance.

For decades, the economic theory of the firm referred to as agency theory has dominated business research and education in the United States. Although agency theory has been influential in accounting, finance, and managerial economics, it lacks informal and nonfinancial controls. Douglas E. Stevens resolves to enhance this theory through the incorporation of social norms. Drawing on historical context related to the firm, the theory of the firm, and social norm theory related to the firm, he demonstrates the importance of social norms in the formation and development of free-market capitalism and the firm. He also describes the latest theoretical, experimental, and archival evidence to exhibit the growing body of research that incorporates social norms into the theory of the firm. These foundations enable Stevens to create a comprehensive roadmap of agency theory that will have strong implications for practice and public policy. (c) Douglas E. Stevens 2019.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of board attributes on Sukuk rating in firms listed in Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Stock Exchange) during the period of 2008 to 2013. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses ordinal logit regression model to examine the influence of board attributes (CEO-chairman duality, board size and board independence) on the dependent variable (RATING). Findings: The findings of this paper generally support the agency theory and stakeholder theory. Results show that after controlling for firm characteristics, the Sukuk rating is positively associated with CEO-chairman duality, board size and board independence; and negatively correlated with leverage while positively related to profitability and size. The findings of this study also provide evidence that having two positions in an organization as CEO and chairman could have added higher responsibility towards making corporate decisions and provide better Sukuk rating performance. In addition, findings show that the larger the board size, the better Sukuk rating. Also, higher board independence enjoys higher rating. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to the investigation of the relationship between board attributes (CEO duality, board size and board independence) on Sukuk ratings using aggregate data from 2008 to 2013 among Malaysian Sukuk issuers. Practical implications: The findings of this paper describe the impact of board attributes on Sukuk rating in Malaysian Sukuk market which in turn gives the useful insights to many of the actors in the markets such as issuers, investors and policymakers which can be relied upon in making strategic decisions to issue and invest in Islamic bonds in Malaysian market. In addition, the findings could prove to be useful also for regulators because they are responsible for the acceptable level of corporate governance standards. Originality/value: This study contributes to the body of knowledge by focusing heavily on enhancing Sukuk ratings by reducing conflict between managers and Sukuk holders in Malaysia. Additionally, this study benefits from the agency theory and stakeholder theory to provide evidence on the effect of board attributes on Sukuk rating. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines how the specific attributes of one type of voluntary corporate governance mechanism, a specialized political contribution committee, improves the transparency of corporate political disclosure (CPD). The results demonstrate that the existence of a committee that establishes and reviews key political activities and disclosure policies, particularly one composed entirely of outside directors, significantly enhances the transparency of corporate political disclosure, and reveal that an under-studied board committee, the political contribution committee, effectively improves CPD transparency. The results are consistent with agency theory and further support the more generalizable idea that specialized governance mechanisms (e.g., a political contribution committee) and fully independent committees lead to more transparent disclosure. Finally, the results suggest that the existence of a political contribution committee and committee independence are channels to improve CPD transparency. Public-policy makers and regulators seeking to enhance CPD transparency might consider implementing regulations that mandate or recommend these governance mechanisms as best practice.

The study aims to evaluate the relation between ownership structure and firm performance; the sample included 171 firms from all the sectors in (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) KSA for two years, 2013-2014. Two dimensions of ownership structure were studied, concentration and identity of owner, which was subdivided into foreign, managerial, family and institutional ownership. One major financial tool was used to measure firm performance: return on assets (ROA). The study evaluated this relation using several control variables which are: firm size, firm age, financial leverage and industry sector. Ownership concentration was found to have a positive, statistically insignificant effect on company performance. Institutional ownership was found to have a positive effect on company performance. Managerial ownership did not have a significant effect on company performance; however, managerial ownership had a positive effect on performance. Foreign ownership was found to have a negative, statistically significant effect on firm performance, and family ownership was found to have a positive and statistically insignificant effect on firm performance. Other results were revealed by the study regarding company age, size, leverage and sector. The study contributes to the debate about agency theory and the separation that exists between shareholders and management. The study may benefit many interested groups in the KSA and other countries in making business decisions concerning this topic and other related decisions.

The objective of this study is to examine the effect of controlling shareholders' monitoring on firm performance through the implementation of operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness. Non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and joining the Environmental Performance Assessment Program (PROPER) are determined as the sample. Results indicate that controlling shareholders have a positive impact on operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness and also on firm performance. In addition, other key findings indicate that the controlling shareholders can improve firm performance through the implementation of operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness. The results of this study support the position of the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, and the legitimacy theory. Operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness is then suggested to be a meaningful strategy for the firms to obtain sustainable performance. (c) 2018 Vilnius University.

Manuscript type: Review paper Research aims: This paper offers Southeast Asian researchers, particularly those from ASEAN, a vision to contribute to international agency theory literature. Design/Methodology/Approach: Most of the studies reviewed were identified during the author's preparation for this paper which involves Malaysia. Research findings: Three research streams to which Malaysian researchers can contribute are: political connections, family companies and corporate recovery. The socio-political contexts that have resulted in Malaysia being a suitable environment are also discussed. This paper identifies gaps in the literature; it accumulates arguments defining why the Malaysian setting is apposite and it also offers research design suggestions for Malaysians and researchers from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, with some defining differences, to follow. Theoretical contributions/Originality: The outcome drawn from this paper assists Malaysian researchers in utilising the agency based theory to approach various topic selections and executions. The comparisons and contrasts made between Malaysia and the other three ASEAN countries may further motivate researchers of the ASEAN region to engage agency theory as a base for their research. Research limitation: A limitation to this paper is that the boundaries between the proposed categories of shareholder political connections are blurred. (c) 2018, University of Malaya.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) exhibit a wide variety of ownership structures but most are entrepreneurially controlled by founders or families. We investigate the relation between REIT ownership/control and REIT valuation. Using proxy data from 1994 through 2007, our analysis shows that, consistent with the incentive alignment prediction of agency theory, founder/family REITs, on average, have a higher valuation than non-founder/ non-family REITs. This result is driven by first-generation family and lone-founder REITs. Our results are also consistent with the entrenchment prediction of agency theory: limits on private benefits of control could lead to higher REIT valuation when founders/families do not occupy both board chairman and CEO positions.

Relying on two years' observations of 74 United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms, we examined the association between governance mechanisms (board size, audit committee, percentage of independent non-executive directors, external auditor, firm leverage and product market competition) and agency costs while controlling for firm size and industry type. We also utilised four different proxies to measure agency costs (asset utilisation, audit fees, expenses ratio and free cash flow measures) to test whether the effect of product market competition on agency costs is substitutive or complementary to internal governance mechanisms. The results show that the percentage of independent non-executive directors and type of external audit significantly influence proxies of agency costs when product market competition is factored out. However, this effect disappears when regressions include product market competition, suggesting that the competitive position of a firm has a substitutive effect to internal governance mechanisms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of investor protection on earnings management before and after IFRS adoption. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 companies listed on Germany, France and Belgium stock markets for the pre-IFRS (2000-2004) and post-IFRS (2006-2011) periods was used. This research is based on a comparative study between the pre- and the post-IFRS periods. Findings: The results showed that investor protection better explains earnings management after the transition to IFRS. The findings revealed that international standards and investor protection are significant in jointly explaining earnings management for the second reporting period. Originality/value: The study gives rise to a score that is considered as a proxy of investor protection that regroups several macroeconomic indexes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of ownership structure on firm valuation and performance across different geographical regions within mainland China. Design/methodology/approach: The authors classify China in six geographical regions and use cross-sectional data of companies with A-shares listed on domestic stock exchanges in China for the year-end 2015. Using data from CSMAR and Wind database, they use multivariate regression technique and analytically compare the consistency of relationship between operational variables of ownership structure with corporate performance and evaluation. Findings: The authors find that institutional ownership and state ownership negatively affect market valuation throughout various geographical regions of China. Further, in East, Northwest, South Central and Southwestern parts of China, managerial ownership and concentration of shareholding among top ten shareholders positively influence return on equity (ROE). Interestingly, institutional shareholding negatively affects return on assets (ROA), while institutional ownership has a neutral effect on profitability margin in Northeast China. Although in northern part of China, this relationship is slightly positive. In East China region, state ownership and ownership concentration are directly proportional to profitability margin. Practical implications: As some of the findings exhibit weak state of market efficiency in some regions, the study may also be useful in identifying arbitrage opportunities across different regions. Moreover, this study suggests that regions with the same business environment and conditions anywhere around the globe invite same or similar ownership structure for better firm performance and valuation. Originality/value: The study provides unique understanding of relationship between ownership structure, market valuation and firm performance in various parts of China and will be an addition to the relevant literature. Given a change in company's ownership structure and considering its region of incorporation, this study will help investment analysts in assessing performance and market valuation of the firm. It will also assist several classes of investors, financial institutions and international businesses in making their investment decisions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Boards sometimes cut a CEO's pay following poor performance. This study examines whether such CEO paycuts really work. We identify 1,496 instances of large CEO paycuts during the period 1994-2013. We then create a propensity-score-matched control group of firms that did not cut their CEOs' pay and employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the consequences of paycuts. Our results show that, following a paycut, CEOs are likely to engage in earnings management in an attempt to accelerate improvement in the reported performance and to achieve a speedier restoration of their pay to pre-cut levels. Further, we find that improvement in long-term performance after a paycut occurs only for those firms with lower levels of earnings management after the paycut. Finally, we show that paycuts are more likely to lead to unintended value-destroying consequences in the absence of high institutional ownership or when the CEO is sufficiently entrenched, thereby impairing the effectiveness of internal monitoring by boards.

Debt-ridden corporate growth and increased vulnerability was one of the causes of the 1997 financial crisis in Korea. Introduction of the outside director system has been the core part of the board reforms following the crisis. Our estimation using instruments obtained from a natural experiment illustrates that outside monitoring has (i) improved capital structure of firms even when we control for the leverage regulation effect, (ii) enhanced compliance with leverage regulation and thus reduced business risks, and (iii) reduced excessive growth and excessive investment more consistently for the top 10 largest chaebols than non-chaebol firms and smaller sized chaebol affiliates. Our results shed some light on why existing studies report the positive effect of outsiders on firm value and add value to existing agency theory by illustrating that the effect of improved governance on capital structure could be non-linear.

This article aims at studying the influence of boardroom attributes on access to leverage in the French context. The empirical findings lead to several interesting results. They reveal a negative relation between the number of female directors on the board and the total and long-term leverage ratios. Due likely to the risk aversion of women, firms with more gender-diverse boards appear to use less levels of debt. This is consistent with the pecking order theory. The results also show that the size of the board, the frequency of its meetings and the average age of its independent directors positively affect the leverage ratios. They are coherent with the disciplinary role of the board stipulated by the agency theory. (c) 2018.

The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains--technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance. (c) 2018

Our study investigates whether agency costs arising from organizational structure in terms of the number of investment layers which connect the parent firm and its lowest-tiered subsidiaries within the corporate pyramid are associated with the value of cash holdings. Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly traded firms, we find that a change of a dollar in cash holdings is associated with less than a dollar change in market value. In line with our expectation, we find that the marginal value of cash decreases with the number of investment layers, supporting the agency theory of excess cash holdings. We also find that the negative association between the number of layers and the value of cash holdings is stronger for firms with high deviation between cash flow and voting rights and for family-controlled firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether real estate companies manipulate their earnings through the brokerage fee across ownership expropriation or not. Design/methodology/approach: This study considers Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange listed real estate firms to investigate how the brokerage fee in the real estate industry might affect the earnings management of firms across its ownership expropriation. Using annual report data, the authors investigate the associations over a panel for the period 2008-2012. Robust panel regression is used to divulge the probability values with reference by probit regression. Findings: Overall, the results show that high brokerage fees would drive more events of earnings management and that, generally, the ownership concentration among Malaysian real estate firms significantly affects the earnings management of the firms. Practical implications: This study shows that firm profitability and brokerage fees enhance the probability of firm's earnings management. A low brokerage fee would reflect low revenue to the company. Therefore, management would opt to manipulate earnings in order to overstate earnings, which garners more interest from investors. Originality/value: Real estate values in Malaysia have climbed steadily over the years due to a combination of reasons giving companies a higher brokerage fee. Earnings management has become a big issue for property investors. The study demonstrates the relationship between earnings management and brokerage fee across ownership expropriation which can be considered by shareholders in their own strategic planning and investors in their own investing.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between corporate governance and corporate events' performance. Firms that engage in corporate events seem to perform at least as bad as similar firms that did not. Based on agency theory, the authors hypothesize that lower corporate performance is associated to differences in governance levels. Design/methodology/approach: Bessembinder and Zhang's (2013) approach to evaluate the performance of corporate events has been expanded by considering unique corporate governance features from Brazilian stock market. Findings: The results suggest that after controlling for governance levels, event rms and control rms have similar performance. A number of analyses were performed to rule out alternative explanations. Originality/value: The results call attention for the role of agency costs in evaluating corporate events' performance.

Different institutional features have been found to affect capital structure decisions, but their connections to corporate finance theories are not always clear. This study aims to assess the predictive power of the agency and pecking order theories in two distinct information environments. The strategy is to compare two similar groups of property firms listed on the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges respectively. Both groups operate in the Mainland property market and are subject to the same tax code, but the degrees of transparency and integrity of the stock markets are weaker for the Mainland-listed firms. We find that factors related to agency conflicts and information asymmetries exert a stronger influence on the capital structure decisions of Mainland-listed firms than on those of the Hong Kong-listed firms. This is confirmed by a test of the agency theory using such corporate governance factors as managerial shareholding and shareholding concentration and by a test of the pecking order theory using an error correction model. A further test on the increments of R-squared in the regression models shows that variables derived from the two theories better explain the variations of the capital structure of Mainland-listed firms than those of Hong Kong-listed firms.

Recent development in Myanmar shows a growing concern of the needs of corporate governance. With enormous economic and political transformations in Myanmar, corporate governance is really important to increase Myanmar's economic potential and foreign direct investment. With the hope and expectation of growing economic potential following the current transformation in Myanmar, the need of good corporate governance is inevitable. Similar to other Southeast Asian countries, the most severe problems in Myanmar arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders instead of problems which arise from the separation of ownership and management. This type of problems is referred as type II agency problems. This paper, to my best knowledge, may be among the first paper which discusses corporate governance in Myanmar. Thus, it should encourage greater debates and discussions on Myanmar's corporate governance. Applying institutional theory and agency theory, this paper provides recommendations to combat type II agency problems and promote good corporate governance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the effect of French family control on the cash flow sensitivity of cash (CFSC). It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French-listed companies from 2012 to 2014, the authors use GLS regression models on panel data estimated with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Findings: The results show that family control is positively associated with the CFSC. This finding suggests that families are likely to hold more cash out of their cash flows for entrenchment and expropriation purposes. A further analysis shows that board size, independence and the two-tier board structure negatively affect the CFSC in family firms. Board efficiency is then a guarantee of minority shareholders' interests against family expropriation risks in France. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that French family firms are likely to expropriate minority interests by extracting rents through their cash holding behavior. However, in the presence of high-quality board features, the relation turns negative, suggesting that the quality of the board is an efficient corporate governance device that is likely to monitor family corporate decisions. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research by investigating the moderating effect of board features on the relation between family control and the CFSC. The research provides a metric for agency problems that is the sensitivity of cash to cash flows and offers theoretical support for the agency argument of hoarding cash.

Built upon the agency theory and the stewardship theory, this study examines the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities among Chinese publicly listed firms. Using a founder-CEO indicator, we separate steward effects from agency effects, and find that Chinese firms' M&A activities are significantly influenced by the steward factors after controlling for the agency factors. Firms, of which CEO is a founder, enjoy relatively higher premium during M&A. Further investigation reveals that the steward effects vary in the power of CEO. The results show that steward effect is reinforced when founder-CEO is more powerful. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Despite the increasing number of studies on corporate governance, the study of what is understood as ''good'' corporate governance and how this ''quality'' is measured has not been extensively approached; thus, what constitutes good corporate governance remains unsolved. To examine the substance of corporate governance quality, we undertake an interpretative analysis of this concept. We conclude that the deep meaning of corporate governance quality is anchored to the theoretical lens adopted to approach it and that agency theory represents the mainstream method employed in this task. Our results question the validity of agency-based metrics of corporate governance for the two following reasons: the endogeneity problem they embed and the agency Universalist approach that does not capture the holistic complexity of corporate governance at a firm level. To tackle such limitations, we propose the behavioural approach to fully capture the substance of what makes 'good' corporate governance and to measure it.

Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are corporate restructuring transactions involving the transfer of whole companies or company divisions to new owners. This chapter reviews the agency and entrepreneurship perspectives of LBOs and outlines arguments concerning their impact on jobs and wages. The seminal work of Jensen provides an agency theory perspective through which LBOs have traditionally been understood. The entrepreneurial perspective is the impact of the LBO governance structure and the role that private equity (PE) firms play in their interaction with portfolio firms. While the theoretical perspectives provide an academic framework for understanding the impact of LBOs on jobs and wages, the nature of the PE business model has also received attention for how it impacts on jobs and wages. Davis et al. conduct one of the most comprehensive studies to date by analyzing the employment effects of PE-backed LBOs at both establishment and firm levels.

The purpose of this conceptual paper is to address the link between corporate governance and operating performance during and after GST implementation. With the support of agency theory, this paper develops six propositions to the relationship between corporate governance and operating performance (SG and CR) during and after GST implementation. The nature of their relationship shall contribute to all stakeholders on the impact of corporate governance to operating performance. This displays on the governance effectives in discharging their roles to strengthen operating performance particularly during a new financial or tax policy implementation that requires necessary changes in business processes. It uncovers the transparency of Malaysian corporate governance commitment and acceptance to GST for firm and country sustainable development. In sum, for business friendly GST requires effective governance to support the firm operating system. (c) Exceling Tech Pub, UK.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of minority shareholders' rights on client's demand for audit quality. Specially, this paper investigates the impact of shareholders' with at least 10% holdings on clients' demand for audit quality. The sample consists of the top 100 listed firms on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) for 2014 and 2015. The result is aligned with the suggestions of the agency theory that shareholders with at least 10% holdings increase clients' involvement with audit quality. The results propose direction for future studies on the role of shareholders to monitor management behavior. This paper calls for future studies in the area of accounting and finance to operationalize a new measurement of Type II agency cost in order to better understand the agency conflicts and the state of the shareholders on the BIST.

Purpose: The authors provide evidence for the effects of social norms on corporate governance risk by studying "sin" stocks publicly traded companies involved in producing alcohol, firearms, biotechnology, gambling, military, nuclear power and tobacco. There is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and expropriation by controlling shareholders. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is representative of S&P 500 firms in 2014. The authors use Datastream to obtain a sample of sin stocks. The authors' descriptive analysis is completed by four variations of the basic ordinary least squares regression model according to dependent variable corporate governance risk score. Findings: The authors find that non-financial incentives alone do not explain corporate governance risk. The authors provide strong empirical support for an alignment of financial and non-financial incentives. The authors show that when sin firm's current performance is good, suggesting that the market holds a positive belief in firm's future profitability, managers will likely have more incentive to expropriate shareholders. Research limitations/implications: Belonging of firm to a sin industry does not reflect the acceptance level of social norms. The evolution of social norms towards sin stocks overcomes the drawback of assuming a constant social norms level over time. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to use the changes in consumption of sin products as a proxy for the evolution of social norms and examine does sin matter in corporate governance issue in other countries. Practical implications: Well-planned and well-managed philanthropy sin industries to creating education programmes for the disadvantaged to protecting the environment, in the name of corporate social responsibility has become a necessary ingredient in virtually every large corporation's business plan. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study does sin matter issue in corporate governance issue. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The ownership structure of large Russian companies is characterized by a high share of state participation, but the relationship of dividend policy with the ownership structure (public or private) is not defined. Statistical analysis of the Russian companies shows that this relationship exists and can be nonlinear. In the course of the regression analysis, the authors tested hypotheses about the existence of a negative relationship between the volume of dividends paid and the share of state participation. We use panel data from nonfinancial companies listed in the Moscow stock exchange from 2008 to 2016, who paid dividends during this period; 150 companies in total. Three specifications were tested: The first one uses the dividend payout ratio as a dependent variable; the second - the share of dividends in the free cash flow; the third has a quadratic form - the nonlinear dependence of dividend payout ratio and share of state participation. Control variables were based on life cycle theory. Testing has shown that in the linear form there is no statistically significant relationship between the indicators of dividend payouts and the share of state participation. We have shown that the relationship between the dividend payout ratio and the share of government participation is non-linear and has the form of an inverted U-shape parabola. For a low level of state participation the dependence is positive but for a high level of participation, it is negative. This result can be explained in the framework of the agency theory: A positive relationship indicates the use of dividend payouts to resolve the agency conflict; a negative - the concentration of money in the hands of managers due to minority shareholders weakness. Further development of the study may include the addition of institutional constraints to the model, as well as the expansion of the concept of the dividend policy outcome within the framework of the firm's sustainable development theory.

The family business is an economically relevant worldwide phenomenon. It is widespread in every industry and it takes diverse legal forms, ranging from micro, small and medium sized firms to large public companies. Its economic relevance frequently impacts more than half of the national GDP and it becomes an essential source of employment. After, presenting some facts and figures about the family business around the world, this chapter shows the two main approaches used to define a family firm, namely the essence and component approaches. We thus review more than 180 definitions of family firms and organise them within a table according to the following three main criteria: (1) Percentage of ownership held by the family, (2) Members of the family involved in management and control positions, and (3) Generational stages of the family firm. The intersection of these three criteria gives rise to other four groups of family firm definitions, theoretically proving the multidimensionality of the phenomenon. We then review the studies on family business and accounting and discuss the main theoretical framework used, with a specific focus on the transition from a mainly agency theory-based literature to the derived socioemotional wealth theory. Finally, this chapter pinpoints some early conclusions on the family business providing a bridge with the ensuing chapter stressing the relations between family firms and accounting choices.

This chapter begins the discussion about earnings quality in family firms. It examines whether family firms differently manage their earnings compared to non-family firms. We show that both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, prior research documents show that family firms manage less their earnings relative to non-family firms. Nonetheless, we also look at deviations from these results, mainly due to the differences in the institutional environment, and/or in the management structure. Moreover, there has been a shift from the agency theory to the socioemotional wealth theory to explain family firms' decisions with regards to earnings management. We conclude this chapter by suggesting future avenues for research, in particular in terms of theoretical framework and research design. The discussion about earnings quality continues in Chap. 4, where we investigate accounting conservatism in family firms. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Dividend Policy is one of the most re-searchable topics in the area of Corporate Finance. Numerous Hypotheses and empirical researches have been done to explain the dividend policy of firms. The most popular is Lintner model (1956), which suggests on previous year dividend and Earnings per share as significant determinants of dividend policy. The pertinent question arises is why some firms pay regular dividends when dividends can be sacrificed for growth and financial stability. The Agency theory highlights the conflict between promoters and managers for dividends over surplus utilization. The Life cycle theory suggests that mature firms tend to ensure regular dividend payout compared to younger firms. Under this context the present paper investigates the Managers Remuneration to ensure dividend stability while maintaining Investment and Financing decisions. The results show that mean of past dividend, managerial remuneration, firm size, return on net worth, firm maturity and debt to equity are the significant variables that influence the regular dividend paying behavior of the Indian firms. However the firm growth, quick ratio, promoter holding and cash earnings per share are not found to be significant determinants of regular dividend of Indian firms. This paper contributes to the literature on dividend policy for Indian firms who are maintaining stable dividend policy. (c) Allied Academies.

The relation between firm performance and shareholding is a critical issue in corporate governance. In this paper, we examine if significant associations exist between firm performance and (1) directors' shareholdings or (2) directors' family shareholdings among Taiwanese listed firms. After addressing for possible endogeneity and controlling for firm specific variables, we find a positive association between executive director's shareholding and firm performance. Consistent with incentive effect in agency theory, this result indicates that executive directors have incentive to maximize firms' value. Also, we find that executive directors' family shareholding is positively related to firm performance, which implies that executive directors may be motivated by their family members to improve firm value. The results also imply that the majority-minority agency problem can be mitigated when director's family welfare is at stake. In addition, we divide research sample into subsets to accommodate the effect of mandatory independent director regulation in Taiwan since 2007. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of independent non-executive directors (INEDs) in Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs), other than the control role prescribed by agency theory and reformatory documents such as the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design, consisting of face-to-face interviews with 27 company directors of Malaysian-owned PLCs, was instigated. Findings: The interviews revealed that INEDs do more than just monitor their executive counterparts. Apart from the control role, INEDs of Malaysian companies provide a conduit for mitigating uncertainties in the environment and perform invaluable services to the host companies. Research limitations/implications: This research utilized interviews. Generalizations may be an issue when interviews are used as the method of inquiry. Also, the sample is not random as access to many of the interviewed directors depended on recommendations. In addition, respondents were consciously selected in order to obtain various board positions that include independent and non-independent directors. Originality/value: There are limited studies using qualitative research design in investigating INEDs' performing other roles apart from the control role of the board in developing countries. Many of previous studies and literature in this area of corporate governance were predominantly based upon experiences of western economies. (c) 2018, Hairul Azlan Annuar.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

This chapter provides an overview of the variety and trends in Management buyouts (MBOs) types or organization. It outlines the theoretical perspectives that have been advanced to explain buyouts. From an academic perspective MBOs have been largely viewed through three theoretical perspectives: agency theory, behavioral theory, and an entrepreneurial perspective. Historically, agency theory has dominated our theoretical understanding of MBOs. Although founded in 1986, the germination of the seed that was to become Centre for Management Buyout Research started in 1979 in a conversation between colleagues about divestments between parent corporations. The chapter discusses some general comments regarding the future prospects for MBOs and private equity (PE). Critics argue that PE-backed buyouts are more likely to fail or enter financial distress as a result of the high amounts of leverage taken on at the time of the deal. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. (c) 2019 selection and editorial matter, Mike Wright, Kevin Amess, Nick Bacon and Donald Siegel.

The role of private equity (PE) firms in buyouts has mainly been developed from the perspectives of agency theory and entrepreneurship theory. This chapter focuses on the part of this literature that has analyzed the effect of buyouts on capital expenditures, other types of investment, and financing constraints. Policy makers are often concerned that these leveraged buyouts make portfolio firms over-indebted. They are also concerned that PE investors have a short-term planning horizon and therefore cut investments, especially those with a long-term character. PE firms can contribute to reducing under- investment in firms with growth perspectives and reducing over-investment in firms with managers that tend to waste free cash flow. The chapter summarizes the effects of buyouts on investment from a theoretical point of view. It introduces the empirical methodology employed by empirical studies and related findings. The chapter discusses methodological problems in the existing literature and suggestions for future research, and the final section concludes.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

In this article, we review recent literature (79 articles) on the impact of corporate governance on corporate tax avoidance. Applying a stakeholder-oriented view, we find that various aspects of corporate governance, such as incentive alignment between management and shareholders, board composition, ownership structure, capital market monitoring, audit, enforcement and government relations, and other stakeholders' pressure have a strong influence on corporate tax avoidance. Findings indicate that effective corporate governance mechanisms steer tax avoidance at its firm-specific optimal level. The classical principal-agent theory, however, fails to fully explain corporate tax avoidance as an outcome. Investigating the determinants of corporate tax avoidance requires a more comprehensive approach taking into account corporate governance institutions and all stakeholders relevant to the firm. We show that corporate governance institutions not only have the potential to increase tax avoidance, making firms more profitable, but also to limit tax avoidance to a level where the arising risks do not outweigh the benefits.

Purpose: This study aims to link environmental disclosure quality (EDQ) to firm performance and examine the moderating role of board independence in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory and stakeholder theory, the authors developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 720 firm-year observations collected from 120 Iranian companies over six years between 2011 and 2016. In this paper, they conducted static and dynamic panel data analysis. Findings: After correcting for endogeneity bias, the results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between EDQ and firm performance. The results also showed that board independence significantly reinforces the positive effect of EDQ on performance, and firms with more independent board members are involved environmental disclosure for improved performance. This is consistent with agency theory, which posits that a more independent board of directors can better monitor the CEO and reduce incentives for pursuing personal interests, which in turn improves performance. The results are robust after performing sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: This paper takes the perspective of corporate governance to empirically examine the effect of EDQ on firm performance. This study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that board independence moderates the effects of EDQ on firm performance. Practical implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. Originality/value: The study adds value to the understanding of the effect of the EDQ on performance and how board independence influences this relationship, particularly in an emerging economy like Iran.

A number of earlier studies suggest that earnings quality improves when females are in senior management because of gender differences in risk-taking and ethical attitude. We extend this literature by using gender socialization theory and agency theory to examine the earnings management behavior of female Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) conditional on their equity incentives. We show that female CEOs do not necessarily reduce earnings management. At lower levels of equity-based compensation, female CEOs manipulate earnings to a lesser degree than their male counterparts. However, at higher levels of equity-based compensation, female and male CEOs exhibit very similar earnings management behaviors. Thus, given high equity incentives, all CEOs - regardless of gender - undertake a greater degree of earnings management activities. Consequently, there is little evidence that the gender of a CEO mitigates the propensity to increase the value of equity-based compensation by manipulating earnings. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using a sample of 22,839 US firm-year observations over the 1991-2012 period, we find that high CSR firms pay more dividends than low CSR firms. The analysis of individual components of CSR provides strong support for this main finding: five of the six individual dimensions are also associated with high dividend payout. When analyzing the stability of dividend payout, our results show that socially irresponsible firms adjust dividends more rapidly than socially responsible firms do: dividend payout is more stable in high CSR firms. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions and model specifications, alternative measures of dividend, additional control, and several approaches to address endogeneity. Overall, our results are consistent with the expectation that high CSR firms may use dividend policy to manage the agency problems related to overinvestment in CSR. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the role of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in restraining earnings management activities of firms under varying levels of investor protection. Firms manage their earnings less when independent FIIs are among their shareholders, especially for firms in which monitoring is more valuable - firms in weak investor protection countries and when firms have greater growth opportunities. These effects are robust to a quasi-exogenous shock to FIIs' shareholdings, unobserved firm heterogeneity, and alternative earning management measures. FIIs are associated with an increase in foreign director presence on corporate boards and audit committees. (c) 2018, Academy of International Business.

Stewardship theory is a popular alternative to agency theory for studying family firm governance. Despite its contributions to management and family business studies, stewardship theory's assumptions limit its realism and relevance. Using agency theory as a standard of comparison, I discuss stewardship theory's model of man and its assumptions concerning goal alignment and control systems. I also discuss stewardship theory's lack of assumptions about bounded rationality and pre-employment situations since the neglect of those issues reduce its realism and relevance. Based on this discussion, I argue that to increase its realism and relevance, stewardship theory's assumptions should be revised. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study examines the impact of CEO duality on firms' internal capital allocation efficiency. We observe that when the CEO is also chair of the board, diversified firms make inefficient investments, as they allocate more capital to business segments with relatively low growth opportunities over segments with high growth opportunities. The adverse impact of CEO duality on investment efficiency prevails only among firms that face high agency problems, as captured by high free cash flows, staggered board structure and low board independence. Depending on the severity of the agency problem, CEO duality is associated with a decrease in industry-adjusted investment in high-growth segments of 1% to 2.1% over the following year, relative to that in low-growth segments. However, CEOs' equity-based compensation curbs the negative effect of CEO duality on internal capital allocation efficiency. Overall, the findings of this study offer strong support for the agency theory and postulate the internal capital allocation policy as an important channel through which CEO duality lowers firm value in diversified firms.

Purpose: The aim of the paper is to examine the association of corporate governance (CG), the firms' characteristics and the financial performance of firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region after Arab Spring. The study focuses on CG, exemplified by boards' composition and ownership structure. It also explores the possible moderating effects of environmental social and governance characteristics (ESG), leverage and size on the relationship between CG and the company's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using Thomson-Reuters database, a sample of 67 firms was extracted in the MENA region to measure CG and financial performance post Arab Spring from 2012 to 2016. Panel GLS regression random effects is used to quantify the relationship; robustness is checked by using several alternative regressions and specifications to the performance measure. Findings: The results reveal that board independence (BI) is negatively correlated with firm profitability but ownership concentration and board gender diversification contribute to profits. When firms that voluntarily form a governance committee are examined, ownership is less concentrated. We obtain a stronger impact of good governance on performance in these firms: board composition, in general, and workers' satisfaction generate more profits; and undertaking ESG activities become a more dispensable activity. The effect of board size (BS) and forming a governance committee are studied and ensuing recommendations are drawn. In addition, relevant internal control of firms' characteristics that strongly predict firms' market values are discussed in the context of agency and stewardship theories. Originality/value: Despite the fact that governance-performance nexus has been extensively discussed and examined, the focus of this volume of research is on western developed countries. The growing economies of the MENA countries, and the limited governance-performance literature in the MENA context have created a demand to understand the governance environment in these countries and its influence on firm's performance. In this region where firms' owners are mainly family members, governments and/or institutions, governance is typically weak; moreover, ownership concentration is expected to guarantee good performance, as the role of independent directors becomes ineffective. For firms where ownership is more diluted, a sound governance system should be established to replace ownership concentration, and to more efficiently monitor management, and consequently improve firm performance. Therefore, this study not only contributes a summary of the prevailing corporate structure in MENA. Moreover, it explains the settings where both the stewardship and agency theories apply in MENA firms. Some recommendation on the importance of changes to the existing governance rules are highlighted in terms of more rules requiring board independence, board gender diversity, limits on board size and establishing governance committees.

The purpose of this study consists in analyzing the existing literature on international business from all the research papers published in Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) during the period of time comprised between 2000 and 2015. The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the understanding and application of interactive ties creating value through board characteristics, ownership concentration and firms' performance by using a contingent theoretical-based framework based on the amalgamation of resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory, stewardship theory and institutional theory in a country with weak political environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study includes a sample of an unbalanced panel of 309 non-financial sector firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) from 2005 to 2016. In order to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneous and dynamic endogeneity, the current study employed the technique Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation under assumptions of GMM (Arellano-Bond, 1991). Findings: The empirical results suggest that the presence of concentrated ownership moderates and helps to overcome the agency problems through different governance mechanisms (such as board size, independent directors and CEO duality). The larger boards are found to be beneficial whereas the higher representation of independent directors in the board is found to be detrimental for Pakistani firms. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are, first the current study has analyzed public-listed firms from the non-financial sector, and second the study has only focused on the financial aspect of the performance. The future research could include other proxies of corporate governance and ownership structure such as board diversity and meetings, audit committee and managerial ownership, etc. Practical implications: The research also helps Pakistani policy makers in numerous ways. First, the current study confirms the monitoring and expropriation effect of ownership concentration in corporate governance and performance mechanism. Thus, the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) should make such policies which protect the corporate board against the influence of concentrated ownership so that the interests of the minority shareholders are protected. Second, SECP should ensure that all the listed firms declare a comprehensive profile of their directors (such as academic qualification, age and experience) in their annual reports for the better understanding of the governance-performance mechanism. Originality/value: The current study augments the emerging body of literature on corporate governance and firm performance mechanism through the amalgamation and testing of existing theories in an emerging economy like Pakistan by using wider and newer data set.

Our paper draws attention to a neglected channel of corruption--the bribe payments by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This is an important phenomenon as bribe payments by SOEs fruitlessly waste national resources, compromising public welfare and national prosperity. Using a large dataset of 30,249 firms from 50 countries, we show that, in general, SOEs are less likely to pay bribes for achieving organizational objectives owing to their political connectivity. However, in deteriorated institutional environments, SOEs may be subjected to potential managerial rent-seeking behaviors, which disproportionately increase SOE bribe propensity relative to privately owned enterprises. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of fostering democracy and rule of law, reducing prevalence of corruption and shortening power distance in reducing the incidence of SOE bribery.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between earnings management and the efficiency of French firms' investments. It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of French listed companies from 2011 to 2015, i.e. 435 firm-year observations. The authors use the instrumental variable method based on 2SLS models. Findings: The authors show that there is a negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency. This finding supports the theoretical perspective of the agency theory, as the propensity of firms to engage in earnings management practices is associated with high managerial opportunistic behavior and asymmetric information issues, leading to the problem of under and overinvestment. The findings also show that board size, independence and gender diversity are positively associated with investment efficiency. These board features moderate the relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggesting that earnings quality plays a more prominent role in guiding managers to choose the right investments when the corporate governance environment is strong. Research limitations/implications: The negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggests that firms with lower earnings quality are exposed to high information asymmetries. They are then more likely to deviate from their expected level of investments. In addition, the results highlight the importance of corporate financial transparency and board monitoring to reduce agency costs and ensure the efficiency of corporate investments, particularly in a setting where investors' interests are poorly protected. Originality/value: This paper is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge to examine the effect of earnings management, a metric for earnings quality, on the corporate investment efficiency in France. Besides, they extend previous literature by investigating how board features are able to monitor managerial actions and decisions and therefore to moderate the effect of earnings management on investment efficiency.

Interlocking directorates, in which companies are linked by the directors that serve on their boards, exist globally. It is an expression of hegemonic power exercised by the elites of a society, and has been studied with great interest by organizational sociologists, management scholars and financial economists. The interest emanates from the effect that interlocks have on wealth creation and distribution, and from the perspective that interlocks can tell us how elites in a society are networked. Although diverse theoretical perspectives have informed the research on interlocking directorates, this review shows that the Anglo-American perspective dominates. This dominance is notable not only in the volume of Anglo-American studies, but also in theories employed by international studies. For example, most international studies use agency theory to investigate the welfare implications of interlocks, but many countries do not use the Anglo-American legal regime, which is the basis for agency theory. This paper expands the theoretical basis of the review to include class hegemony and resource dependence, to articulate better the causes and consequences of interlocks in the international context. The paper also extends theory by showing that institutions have an important influence on interlocks, so that the latter can be welfare-depleting in one institutional setting, while welfare-enhancing in another. The review concludes by discussing the implication for future research. (c) 2018 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The extant literature reports mixed and inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. To provide incremental insight, this paper aims to investigate whether the bi-directional relationships among managerial ownership, board independence and firm performance are determined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a data set consisting of 9,302 firm-year observations of Australian listed companies during 2005-2015 and a three-stage least squares simultaneous equation model to test the bi-directional relationships. Findings: The results indicate that both managerial ownership and board independence inversely affect firm performance and vice versa. In addition, board independence is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and vice versa. Practical implications: The convergence-of-interests hypothesis can be achieved by manipulating managerial ownership through making contingent payments. Board independence, as a voluntary regime in Australia, can provide additional flexibility to corporate decision makers. Originality/value: This study provides additional evidence by using the convergence-of-interests hypothesis vis-a-vis the entrenchment hypothesis to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance, and tests the association of board independence and firm performance using the explanation of agency theory vis-a-vis stewardship theory.

Considering specific contextual differences (in laws, governance attributes, and CEO pay policies) found between the Anglo-American and the European corporate governance models and controlling for institutional attributes, ownership structures, and firm's features characterizing the two settings, we aim to explore if there is a link between CEO pay slice (CPS) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We follow Bebchuk et al. () to measure CPS. We consider sustainability indicators as proxy to capture CSR. Sustainability indicators are gathered from Global Reporting Initiative of sustainability standards (GRI's) report. Data cover the period 2010-2017 and consist of 1,440 U.S.-Canadian and Spanish-French firm-year observations. American and Canadian (Spanish and French) firms are considered as to refer to the Anglo-American (European) corporate governance model. Durbin-Wu-Hausman test is ruled to address endogeneity problem of dual variables and supports consistent null hypotheses of fixed effects model. Under the agency theory's "bright side" paradigm, univariate and multivariate cross-country analysis supports that CPS is positively associated with firm's initiatives to engage in CSR and that sustainability is more pronounced under stronger investor protection, strict law enforcement, and higher corporate governance quality. Robustness checks reveal that (a) the deferred CPS-CSR causal effect seems higher for option-based compensation than that for stock-based compensation and (b) within the options (stocks) rewards, unvested options (restricted stocks) are the most effective to enhance firm's CSR practices.

The effectiveness of monitoring and incentive alignment as mechanisms for controlling agency costs have been explored separately and in combination, with monitoring substituting for weaknesses in incentive alignment and vice versa; this equates to positive substitution when describing how monitoring and incentive alignment interact to influence shareholder agency costs. We draw upon behavioral agency theory and findings from finance research to offer further theoretical insight into how these mechanisms interact to influence agency costs. Our results suggest that CEO earnings management aimed at preserving their equity wealth (an incentive alignment mechanism) is accentuated by higher levels of concentrated institutional ownership, thereby imposing agency costs on less informed investors. Thus, in addition to being substitutes in controlling agency costs, as previously suggested, monitoring may accentuate the perverse effects of incentive alignment, equating to negative reinforcement, rather than positive substitution. Yet this effect is negated in the absence of CEO power due to dual occupation of the board and CEO roles. We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to empirically investigate the effect of financial reporting quality (FRQ) and audit quality (AQ) on the investment efficiency (IE) for the firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during the period 2007-2014. Design/methodology: The authors use pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression which cluster at the firm and year level to test the hypotheses. For sensitivity check, the authors also account for reverse causality and cross-sectional dependence by using the GMM and FGLS regression methods. Furthermore, the authors built their theoretical arguments based on alignment hypothesis of the agency theory and resource-based view of the firm. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and AQ are associated with higher IE. The results for these particular estimates are robust when tested using alternative estimation techniques. Overall, the outcomes of this study are in line with the arguments presented by the alignment hypothesis of the agency theory and resource-based view of the firm. Practical implications: This study is fruitful for policymakers' and investors. This study finds that the audit done by the Big 4 also reduces the information gap and, thus, reduces the moral hazard and adverse selection problems, thereby enhancing the IE. Originality: The authors extend the debate on determinates of IE and highlight two monitoring mechanisms: FRQ and AQ. The authors further extend the literature on the economic consequences of AQ in terms of IE, as proposed by Francis (2011). For the first time, this study investigates the impact of AQ on IE in a setting where minority shareholder risk of exploitation is high relative to other markets in Asia.

Ownership structure has been identified as a critical governance component due to its effect on firm performance. Within ownership structure, issues of institutional shareholders, cash flow rights of controlling owners, and ownership discrepancy have not been examined in the tourism sector. The current study uses listed tourism firms in Taiwan to empirically examine how these three variables influence firm performance. Results show a positive effect on return on assets and Tobin's Q from the presence of institutional shareholders and cash flow rights of controlling owners. Ownership discrepancy has a negative effect on Tobin's Q. The present results can make contributions to agency theory and principles for good governance. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Much of the management compensation literature focuses either on the level and structure of executives' pay or the pay-for-performance sensitivity in a set of corporate governance structure in the Western economies. In this study, we examine the interactive effect of executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance in different institutional and governance settings of an emerging market economy. Capturing monitoring and incentive alignment aspects as suggested in agency theory, we argue that in a markedly different executive compensation system in Thailand, the interrelationships between executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance would exhibit some similarities to those found in developed economies. While there remains sparse research on how these relationships operate in Thailand, using data for 432 publicly listed Thai firms between 2000 and 2011, we find evidence of a reciprocal positive significant relationship between compensation and performance, as well as between corporate governance and performance. However, a reciprocal relationship is not found between corporate governance and compensation, which shows a mono-directional positive significant relationship running from corporate governance to compensation. These findings show similarities with those of developed economies and provide support for the need for an effective governance system to determine optimal executive compensation that will enhance firm performance and value. Our findings thus add some potentially noteworthy dimensions to the compensation literature that are especially important to policy makers and other stakeholders, and aiming to shape an optimal governance system in the emerging markets around the world.

Research Question/Issue: Although there is no unified theory that can explain the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, the empirical evidence generally finds a positive association. This study argues that market competition and corporate governance play critical roles in influencing this relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large panel of nonfinancial U.S. corporations for the period 1992-2015, I find that CEO power is positively associated with total and idiosyncratic measures of risk. However, this positive association remains significant only when market competition is high or corporate governance is strong. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The research design of this study combines the predictions of agency theory, the behavioral agency model, and prospect theory to further our understanding of the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, including consideration of how competition and corporate governance influence this relationship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The empirical evidence presented in this study can help boards to more accurately gauge when CEO power is most beneficial in terms of optimal levels of corporate risk and to better understand the relationship between power and risk. The results suggest that boards should grant more power to their CEOs when their firms operate in high-competition markets or have strong corporate governance in place. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Following the agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature on board independence as a mechanism to mitigate agency costs by investigating the impact of independent minority directors on firm value in a principal-principal setting. Independent minority directors might alleviate agency costs associated to the risk of self-dealing transactions and, in turn, increase firm value. However, since non-controlling shareholders are also self-interested, particularly for firms characterized by strong uncertainty about future financial results and high information asymmetry, independent minority directors might negatively impact firm value by creating frictions within the board, increasing the risks of potential hold-ups by minority shareholders and limiting the ex-ante incentives of the block-holder to undertake profitable idiosyncratic investments. By examining a sample of Italian listed companies, we find some evidence about a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value. Although weaker, a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value is also found for firms characterized by high information asymmetry and--therefore--exposed to the risk of opportunistic actions by minority shareholders against the dominant shareholder. Our results shed new light on the relationship between board composition and firm value in a concentrated ownership setting, revealing the role played by independent minority directors in mitigating agency costs.

Purpose: High ownership concentration makes controlling blockholders powerful enough to use private benefits of control and able to shape the corporate governance system to favor their own interests. This paper aims to examine the effect of the nature of the ultimate firm owner on the quality of corporate governance in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: Econometric models are estimated to assess whether the nature of the ultimate controlling shareholder affects the quality of the corporate governance system. Models are estimated using panel data methodology with coefficients estimated by the generalized method of moments system estimator. Findings: The results show that the absence of a controlling shareholder has a positive effect on corporate governance, whereas the presence of a controlling blockholder, or a shareholder agreement among a few large shareholders, has a negative effect. This adverse effect holds when the controlling blockholder is a family or another firm. The findings are in line with the expropriation effect given that weaker corporate governance system facilitates controlling shareholders' ability to extract private benefits of control. The findings also give support to the substitution effect as powerful blockholders take on the management monitoring function by weakening the board. Originality value: Following important previous literature, the study investigates the effect of the nature of large controlling shareholders on the adoption of good corporate governance practices. The work provides additional evidence on the effect of the nature of large controlling shareholders on the quality of the corporate governance system in Brazil, taking into account the main kinds of controlling blockholders present in that market. The findings give support to both the expropriation and substitution hypotheses highlighting the presence of the principal-principal agency model in an important emerging market, Brazil.

We synthesize the empirical archival literature on the determinants of auditor choice in an international setting, critique the findings, and offer suggestions for future research. We categorize the determinants into (i) firm-level ownership variables, (ii) nonownership corporate governance determinants, (iii) economic determinants driven by the risk of information asymmetry, and (iv) country-level institutional determinants, including legal protection of investors, political connections, and national culture. Our comprehensive review not only enriches the academic literature, but also provides material of considerable interest to investors, practitioners (auditors), and regulators.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of two monitoring mechanisms: family ownership (FO) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on investment efficiency (IE) over the period of 2007-2014 for listed firms on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ two-dimensional pooled OLS cluster at the firm and year level, two-stage least square regression and feasible generalized lease square regression regression methods. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and FO are associated with higher IE. Further, the authors report that higher FRQ and FO mitigate over- and under-investment. The impact of FRQ on IE is stronger (weaker) for family-controlled businesses. The results for these particular estimates are robust for alternative estimation techniques and measures of FRQ and FO. Originality/value: The study draws on both agency and behavioral agency theories and therefore contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, the authors examine a relationship between FRQ and IE. Second, the authors test the impact of FO on IE. Third, the authors test the moderating impact of FO on the relationship between FRQ and the IE of family and non-family firms in relatively less regulated emerging market.

Purpose: In order to deepen our knowledge of governance of family firms, the purpose of this paper is to focus our attention on the relation between family owners who are members of the board of directors and firm performance. Also, this study sheds more light on how the generation in charge of the family firm affects that relationship, as generational involvement may be a unique predictor of governance behavior in these firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 313 non-listed Spanish family SMEs. The authors suggest the possibility of a non-linear relationship between the percentage of ownership by family members of the board of directors and firm performance, and specifically, the authors propose an S-shaped effect that implies two breakpoints. Findings: The authors find not only that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists, but also an S-shaped relationship between family board members' ownership and firm performance in family SMEs. Nevertheless, the results are different in comparing first-, second- and later-generation family firms. Originality/value: This is one of the few empirical studies that examine the relationship between family board ownership and firm performance in the context of non-listed family SMEs. The authors consider that the influences of family directors on the board of directors as well as the concentration of family ownership on the board of directors are worth studying in non-listed family SMEs. Moreover, previous studies have focused mainly on large listed family firms but not on unlisted ones. (c) 2019, Amaia Maseda, Txomin Iturralde, Gloria Aparicio, Lotfi Boulkeroua and Sarah Cooper.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Based on both institutionalized agency theory and meso-level theory, this study examines corporate governance disclosure in an audit firm's transparency report (TR) and whether more disclosure is associated with (a) the audit function of the country in which it is disclosed; (b) high levels of investor confidence in public interest entities (PIEs) shown in the portfolio of the audit firm; and (c) increased competition within the audit market. Research Findings/Insights: On the basis of content analysis, different measures of a corporate governance disclosure index (CGDI) are calculated for a sample of 122 auditing firms from 10 European countries over the period 2010-2012. Despite attempts at harmonizing audit practice across the EU, results confirm the role of institutional context in explaining differences among European countries. Moreover, while the CGDI reveals that the TR does improve investor confidence, no evidence was found that the new disclosure requirement unsettled audit market concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support arguments of the institutionalized agency theory that audit firms' corporate governance disclosures depend on both firm- and country-level factors. Moreover, the interplay between these macro and meso factors explains the information asymmetry reduction that exists between auditors and shareholders, thus improving micro-level investor confidence. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides an analysis of audit firm transparency based on the information disclosed in mandatory TRs. Policymakers and practitioners may benefit from the knowledge of items included in the TRs expected to impact on investor confidence. It also proposes the use of the TR for achieving market competition strategies, although it may be inefficient. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: Based on the agency theory and risk management perspective, this study aims to examine the relationship between CEOs' pay schemes and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the restaurant industry. Specifically, the authors propose that CEOs with a higher proportion of equity-based compensation (EBC), which induces a greater propensity for risk-taking, are prone to indulge less in CSR. In addition, the authors investigate how institutional ownership moderates the proposed main relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs two-way fixed-effects models and clustered standard errors to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results of the panel analysis show a significant negative effect of CEOs' EBC on CSR. Also, the authors found a significant positive moderating effect of institutional ownership between CEOs' EBC and CSR. Originality/value: Given the lack of empirical studies that incorporate both agency theory and the risk management perspective, and given the importance of understanding the determinants of restaurant firms' CSR activities, this study expands upon the existing literature by showing the relationship between CEOs' compensation schemes and restaurant firms' CSR activities.

We examine whether compensation committee existence (CCX) and compensation committee effectiveness (CCE) are associated with CEO pay-performance alignment, using data drawn from a sample of Australian listed companies. We find that compensation committee existence and effectiveness are positively associated with CEO pay-performance alignment. Further, our results show that the relationships hold for the pre- and post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) periods but not for the crisis period. This evidence supports the prospect theory argument that in times of macroeconomic crisis, uncontrollable factors external to the firm constitute a firm's reference point for making executive remuneration decisions. These results are robust to alternative measures of firm performance and CEO cash compensation as well as tests of endogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that compensation committees contribute to addressing agency problems pertinent to contemporary corporate governance practices. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Prior studies suggest that most expropriation of firm's resources is conducted through related party transactions (RPTs). Based on the conflict of interest view, related parties opportunistically use their authorities to expropriate firms' resources for their own benefits via RPTs subsequently increasing agency costs and reduce firm value. One important monitoring system suggested by agency theory to reduce the agency problem is corporate governance (CG). CG monitors firm's performance to align the interests of those who control and those who own the residual claims in a firm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating effect of CG characteristics on the relationship between RPTs and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: In order to clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorises RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). Applying "proportionate stratified random sampling", this study covers a panel of 271 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period of 2009-2011, using a moderated multiple regression model. Findings: This study documents that firm value is positively associated with beneficial RPTs (BRPTs) and negatively related to detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). In addition, results show that divergence can intensify the negative relationship between DRPTs and firm value. Findings support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs and restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improve CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Research limitations/implications: Research implications have been presented in Section 10. It has also been summarised in practical implications and social implications sections. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that investors, creditors and policy makers should not consider all RPTs as harmful transactions and it seems necessary to categorise RPTs into different groups including transactions which are detrimental and transactions which are beneficial to the firm. Social implications: The findings of this study support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs. They should restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improving CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Originality/value: This study contributes to the RPTs literature by showing that the effect of RPTs on firm value depends on the types of RPTs, and market participants allocate different values to different types of RPTs. Therefore, to fill the gap and clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorizes RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, in emerging economies, the relationship between a firm's corporate governance (CG) and its performance is associated with firm's affiliation to a business group. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 209 publicly listed firms in India during a 10-year period from 2007 to 2016 were studied, and the random effects model was employed for analysis. Findings: Empirical evidence showed that board size and institutional shareholding positively impacted firm performance, whereas the proportion of independent directors negatively impacted performance. In group-affiliated firms in emerging economies, chief executive officer duality negatively impacted, whereas institutional shareholding positively impacted performance. These results are consistent with the principal-principal agency theory. The study found no discernible impact of proportion of independent directors on firm performance in group-affiliated firms. Originality/value: In analyzing the governance-performance relationship and its association with business groups, this study extends current understanding by connecting business group research in emerging economies with CG and firm performance research. In examining firms from several industries over a long period of time after controlling for firm size, capital structure and spends on research and development and marketing, the results of this study offer rich empirical evidence that contributes to the extant literature on the nature of the governance-performance relationship.

The so called "dividend puzzle" has prompted many researchers to examine industry-specific factors in order to explain the dividend behaviors of various industries. However, due to the unique differences in characteristics between franchise and non-franchise restaurants, it may not be appropriate to view the restaurant industry as one entity displaying homogenous dividend behaviors. In this regard, this study investigated the role of franchising in explaining the dividend behaviors of the restaurant industry. The results of this study demonstrate that the dividend behaviors of franchise restaurants are a function of the size of institutional holdings and prior dividend payments, while those of non-franchise restaurants depend on the degree of growth opportunity and financial leverage. The findings further imply that franchise restaurants with higher free cash flows and the resulting information asymmetry closely follow agency theory and signaling theory, whereas non-franchise restaurants with insufficient internal cash strictly follow the pecking order theory.

This paper investigates how foreign ownership shapes bank information environments. Using a sample of listed banks from 60 countries over 1997-2012, we show that foreign ownership is significantly associated with greater (lower) informativeness (synchronicity) in bank stock prices. We also find that stock returns of foreign-owned banks reflect more information about future earnings. In addition, the positive association between price informativeness and foreign ownership is stronger for foreign-owned banks in countries with stronger governance, stronger banking supervision, and lower monitoring costs. Overall, our evidence suggests that foreign ownership reduces bank opacity by exporting governance, yielding important implications for regulators and governments.

Research Question/Issue: Concentrated ownership is more the rule than the exception in weak institutional environments, and the absence of external control mechanisms, leading to ineffective legal enforcement, intensifies principal-principal agency issues. Our study examines how the structuring of the corporate board plays a vital role in informing foreign investors about the risk of being expropriated, which affects their decisions to make equity investments in firms in weak institutional regimes. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed Indian firms in the period 2010-2014, we hypothesize that the presence of affiliate directors on the board has a negative impact on foreign investments. Likewise, the presence of controlling owners-directors on the board together with chief executive officers' additional directorial positions has an inverted U-shaped impact on foreign investments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By making use of agency theory and focusing on the importance of foreign financing, our study highlighted the factors that deter foreign investors from providing capital to firms in weak institutional regimes. The use of this theoretical perspective, by emphasizing the differences in agency problems prevalent in strong versus weak institutional regimes, further suggested that examination of the structure of corporate boards is an important way to detect and gauge the potential for expropriation in countries suffering from weaknesses in investor protection. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has important implications for corporations operating in markets suffering from a legal environment that offers little investor protection. Investors are less prone to invest in these countries, as the risk of expropriation by dominant shareholders means they cannot be sure of actually getting the putative return. Our work shows how corporations can structure their boards effectively to convince investors that they face less danger of expropriation and so attract foreign capital. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Agency theory argues that pay for performance alleviates the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. Furthermore, the literature finds that institutional monitoring tends to promote the performance-pay linkage, thus aligning the two parties' incentives. We find that executive compensation rigidity is negatively and significantly associated with firm value. Moreover, ownership by long-term institutional investors reduces the pay rigidity of top managers in underperforming firms, thus decreasing the value-destroying effect of the rigidity. Overall, these results reaffirm the role of institutional monitoring in mitigating managerial rent extraction. (c) 2019 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association

This study aims to examine the direct and moderating effects of the chief executive officer's (CEO) decision horizon and the board governance on a firm's entry into new technological fields, respectively. In a sample of 1727 firm-year observations for 156 Taiwanese firms in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industries for the period of 2003-2014, we found that the longer the CEO decision horizon, the more eager the focal firm is to enter new technological fields. Such a relationship is also strengthened by board power characterized by boards dominated by more outside directors, but weakened by board homogeneity of industry background. The configurational analysis further reveals that board homogeneity outweighs board power in reducing the positive influence of the CEO decision horizon on technological entry. This study not only contributes to the behavioral agency theory by infusing and testing CEO decision horizon to enhance predictions of the incidence of entering into new technological fields, but also reveals the contextual influences of board governance on executive risk taking. In addition, this study cautions against drawing a simple governance solution in support of a firm's technological entry. We point out different governance arrangements in which the CEO decision horizon will encourage more active technological entries in an environment of incessant changes. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

We examine the relationship between disproportionate insider control, enabled through dual-class share structures, and the demand for audit quality. Using a comprehensive hand-collected sample of U.S. dual-class firms, we find that, consistent with outside shareholders' increased demand for external monitoring, as well as selfbonding by entrenched insiders, disproportionate insider control is positively associated with the propensity to hire a Big 4 or industry specialist auditor, auditor independence, and audit fees. Corroborating a self-bonding explanation, additional analyses show that audit quality mitigates the negative association of disproportionate insider control and firm value. In expanded analyses, we also investigate the separate effects of insider voting and cash flow rights on the demand for audit quality in dual-class firms. Consistent with general agency theory, we find a decreased (increased) demand for audit quality from incentive-alignment (entrenchment) effects of ownership.

Over the last decade, the strategic implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have become one of the most important themes of research in the literature of business in society. While the understanding of a company has been placed for years within the presumed conflict between shareholder and stakeholder, today the shift towards an integrated approach is expected by various constituencies and driven by regulation. Thus, corporate governance (CG) focusing solely on financial performance cannot be an asset for companies if detached from the assumptions of socially and environmentally responsible business. CSR isolated from strategy and governance does not provide the fundamental change towards integrated thinking and a transition to a low-emission, resource-efficient economy. This article is based on a systematic literature review addressing links between corporate governance and CSR at the company level. We indicate a radical reorientation in both concepts and reveal the corresponding evolution of the theoretical view developing from agency theory towards enlightened shareholder value and a stakeholder-agency view. Specifically, adopting two dimensions of strategic fit between CSR activity and the core business and formal environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance, we propose a four-mode integration construct of a corporate social responsibility and corporate governance (CSR-CG) relationship. We identify actions undertaken by a company in the selected modes with respect to strategic focus, supervision, accountability, performance measures, and reporting.

We investigate private firms' ability to identify and replace poorly performing managers across countries. We document three main findings. First, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers in countries where legal institutions that protect minority investors are weak. Second, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers than public firms only in countries where governance mechanisms inherent in public equity markets limit managerial entrenchment in public firms. Third, private firm managers are less likely to be replaced even when poor performance continues for relatively long horizons. Overall, our findings provide new evidence on the potential vulnerability of minority shareholders in private firms. (c) 2019, Academy of International Business.

This paper examines the relationship between leverage, debt maturity and firm performance, employing a large panel of Chinese non-financial listed firms. The corporate finance literature widely recognizes that the debt and maturity structures are important mechanisms for addressing agency problems in modern corporations. We applied the system GMM estimator to control for endogeneity concerns in the study. We found positive associations between leverage and the proportion of long term debt, and between leverage and firm performance. Our results indicate that leverage and its maturity structure are important determinants of the profitability of Chinese listed firms. Our research has significant policy implications as it suggests that, since China's financial system is dominated by a large banking system, lenders (mainly banks) may extend more long term credit to the more productive private sector, which helps to improve performance of these firms.

Although the link between managerial ownership and firm performance is often explained in relation to a firm's risk-taking behavior, little is known about how managerial ownership affects corporate risk-taking in industries characterized by high financial and operational risks, like the restaurant industry. To understand this important and understudied link, our study draws upon agency theory to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and franchising, typically a risk-reduction strategy of restaurant firms. Our results from panel data analyses using a sample of 962 firm-year observations show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with degree of franchising. Further, we find that after considering the scope of managerial discretion, there is a U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and degree of franchising such that the degree of franchising decreases as managerial ownership increases up to a certain level, but then increases in tandem as managerial ownership increases to higher levels. Our results indicate that there is an optimal level of franchising associated with managerial ownership, implying that owners can influence their firms' risk-taking behavior by setting target managerial ownership goals and designing effective incentive contracts.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the voluntary disclosure practices of family and non-family listed firms and whether family firms have improved their disclosure practices following the introduction of the Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations in 2003 in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: Voluntary disclosures are measured by constructing an index specifically for this study. Such indexes consist of corporate governance disclosure, strategic disclosure and future disclosures. They are then regressed on firm-specific variables while controlling for family and non-family firms. A total of 60 family firms and 60 non-family firms in Australia are randomly chosen from 2001 to 2006 for examining their disclosure practices. Findings: The research findings show that family firms disclose information voluntarily to signal to the market regarding their growth potentials and abide by government regulations to improve their reputation. Despite the fact that compliance with the Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations was not compulsory, this paper finds that the recommendation encouraged family and non-family firms to disclose more corporate governance information. Practical implications: The findings from this research will help investors and regulators make more strategic decisions on investments and regulations respectively in family firms. Originality/value: There has been limited empirical evidence on the disclosure practices and their determinants of family firms in Australia. The study will thus significantly contribute to the current knowledge in this regard. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Studies in developed economies show that family-owned non-financial firms outperform others, explained by agency theory and protection of family capital. Findings in emerging economies are equivocal, while studies of family domination and banks' performance are scant. This paper examines the profit-performance of family-dominated banks in Bangladesh under competing hypotheses of bank-market structure. Using panel estimation, we model the profit-performance of banks and show that the principal drivers are costs, efficiency and non-performing loans. Family-dominated banks are less efficient and less profitable. The sources of weaker performance are higher non-performing loans and higher costs, with indirect evidence of poor corporate governance.

Scholars argue that the agency theory has some limitations as the sustaining theory of governance. It is its inability to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces effecting on organisations. This paper delivers a concise picture incorporating other management-based theories to supplement agency theory in distinguishing the wider stakeholder influencing forces as well as the consequential extended governance standard it creates. Yet, for developing the theory building approach it has reviewed and critically examined the existing literatures. Furthermore, a circumstance is built to assimilate four existing theories that supplement each other to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces. Finally, further studies have been recommended to certify the approach with wide-ranging real life institutional settings.

The dividend puzzle remains an interesting subject especially in emerging markets where agency problem is severe. This study examines the issues by assessing the large shareholders controlling interest in manager owned firms and corporation owned firms. A sample data of 762 Malaysian public listed firms covering the period from 2008 to 2014 are examined. The results show a statistically significant non-linear relationship between the largest shareholder (LO) and dividend payout for manager owned (MO) firms. MO firms reduce dividend distribution according to assets and revenue when the largest shareholder's controlling stake is low. However, at a higher level of controlling stake, MO firms increase dividend distribution, irrespective of firms share prices, assets and revenues. The study shows that corporation owned (CO) firms do not associate significantly with the dividend payout, but MO firms pursue different types of dividend distribution policies. Lastly, there is a need to improve the role of the second largest shareholder as a governance mechanism. (c) 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.

Purpose: Motivated by agency theory, this paper aims to explore the impact of bank diversification and bank independency on the likelihood of bank failure. The effects of corporate governance (ownership and board structures) are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regressions are used to explore the role of corporate governance on bank failure risk. This sample covers 608 banks from eight European countries. Findings: The results suggest that the well-documented finding that diversification and bank independency may increase bank failure risk does not persist under strong corporate governance mechanism. Thus, to reduce the bank failure risk, diversification should be strongly monitored by the management to avoid excessive risk-taking by shareholders. Originality/value: The approach used in this study differs from that used in previous studies from certain perspectives. First, unlike most previous studies that focused on the relationship between bank performance and bank diversification, the impact of income and asset diversification on bank failure is tested. Also, the impact of a combined effect of diversification and corporate governance variables on bank failure is tested. This allows the control for different ownership and board variables as factors that would potentially affect the likelihood of bank failure. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores new evidence considering the global debate regarding board leadership structure and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance by observing 80 microfinance institutions in Bangladesh from 2010 to 2015. Random (GLS) and fixed (LSDV) effects models were applied in identifying the insignificant positive effects of CEO duality into microfinance sustainability and the negative effects on outreach of the poor. Results indicate that the structure of board leadership, have positive effects on the sustainability performance of microfinance but have negative effects on outreach performance. The findings contribute to the microfinance governance literature on board leadership and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance.

Using Continental European data on Indonesia, this research investigates the effect of Board of Commissioners involvement which is measured by responsibility, seniority, women participation and independency on shareholder's wealth. This paper is the first research that examines the association between Board of Commissioners involvement and shareholder's wealth based on 249 Indonesia listed companies. Panel data analysis was used to assess whether the Board of Commissioners responsibility and independency have positive effect on shareholder's wealth. Based on the finding, seniority and women involvement have a negative relationship with shareholder's wealth. These findings have practical implication, i.e. the shareholders should consider the Board of Commissioners involvement in appointing and dismissing them. Theoretically, these findings contributed to the agency theory in the way that the Board of Commissioners involvement could reduce the agency cost and increase the wealth of shareholders. (c) BEIESP.

When a firm is facing default, equity holders have incentives to engage in asset substitution, underinvest, or directly transfer wealth. Few papers document investment distortions on account of debt-equity agency conflicts, only that the threat of distortions influence ex ante financing costs. A nonagency residential mortgage-backed security deal represents an entity that is highly leveraged where, ex ante, equity holders know they will face default. This provides an ideal laboratory for testing whether the threat of default creates any of the distortions predicted in theory. We estimate a lower bound on agency costs associated with direct wealth transfers to be in the range of $.018 per dollar. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

This study investigates whether agency conflicts affected the demand of audit quality by Tunisian listed firms. Our theoretical framework suggests that firms with high agency conflicts were more likely to demand audit quality. Focusing on owners, shareholders and lenders agency conflicts, we conduct an empirical study based on data from 253 firm-year observations. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of agency theory. We show that an increase in managerial ownership decreases the likelihood that the firm will engage a Big 4 auditor. An increase in ownership concentration and leverage in high investment opportunities set, on the other hand, increases the likelihood of a firm demanding higher audit quality. We document that size of audited client is also a significant determinant of audit quality demand. (c) 2020, Economics Bulletin.

The effectiveness of corporate governance provides a promising value creation to firm even during implementation of new policy for example during Goods & Services Tax (GST) implementation in year 2015. By embracing agency theory, this paper investigates five corporate governance variables relationship with operating performance (sales growth and current ratio) during and after GST implementation. This study examines 265 Malaysian listed firms for year 2015 (during) and 2016 (after) GST implementation period. The OLS regression results report that there is significant relationship of corporate governance in firm operating performance particularly during and after GST implementation. Board independent, CEO age and family CEO have positively contribute to sales growth during and after GST implementation. For working capital effectiveness during and after GST implementation, the CEO age and family CEO delineate significant positive association with operating performance (current ratio). This displays on the governance effectives in discharging their roles to strengthen operating performance particularly during a new financial or tax policy implementation that requires necessary changes in business processes. It uncovers the transparency of Malaysian corporate governance commitment and acceptance to GST for firm and country sustainable development. In sum, an effective governance system that supports the firm operating performance makes GST as a business friendly tax system. (c) ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

This study investigates the impact of insider-ownership of publicly traded firms on their performance, cost of debt (COD) and cost of equity. We use a sample of 104 non-finance listed companies of Pakistan for the period from 2006 to 2016. Our study is conducted in Pakistan as a developing country in which insider-ownership is dominant, and a weak external corporate governance mechanism increases the payoffs from insider-ownership. We use feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression methods to examine these hypotheses. Based on agency theory, we find that insider-ownership enhances firm performance. Furthermore, our results show that insider-ownership reduced the COD and equity. Higher ownership decreases the opportunistic behavior of insiders. It also reduces the creditor's perception of the likelihood of default on loan payments and reduces agency issues among shareholders. The insider will invest in positive NPV projects which will help maximize shareholders' wealth and minimize the COD. Similarly, the relationship between insider-ownership and cost of equity is significant but negative. Supporting the convergence of interest increase in ownership helps in aligning the goals of managers and stakeholders whereby the insider will focus on value creation by minimizing equity cost.

This chapter illustrates the main issues with respect to innovation process within family firms. In the first part, it describes the main theories underlying the innovation process of family firms (agency theory, altruism, portfolio theory, stewardship theory, socioemotional wealth perspective). In the second part, it exposes the R&D underinvestment problem in large companies with a focus on the effect of the family ownership on the R&D investments. In the third part, it describes the effect of family ownership on the innovation output with a focus on the kind of innovation (radical vs. incremental). In the fourth section, studies exploring the innovation strategies of family firms (prospectors, analysers, defenders, reactors) are examined. In the fifth section, it sheds light on the innovation management process of family firms. In this part, it explores the issues of internal innovation process (functional vs. cross-functional structure) and of the partnerships with external actors aimed to generate innovation.

This chapter analyses the relationship between ownership structure and leverage, providing an integrated theoretical approach that combines traditional financial theories, agency theory, and recently developed theories relating to non-financial preferences. The results show that, after controlling for endogeneity, being a family firm has a positive effect on the propensity to incur debt. These findings add to the existing body of literature and underline the need for a multi-theoretical approach when explaining the capital structure of family firms. The authors apply panel data methodology to control for individual heterogeneity of family firms. The chapter uses a sample of Spanish firms operating in the tourism industry. (c) 2020, IGI Global.

Preference for appearance over substance (AOS) refers to people's desire to look better than their actual appearance. In this paper, we explore the economic implications of AOS on corporate investment. Using novel country-level proxies for AOS based on the prevalence of plastic surgery and cosmetic industry concentration, we first document that AOS is negatively (positively) associated with investment sensitivity to growth opportunities (cash flows). Second, external financing is less (more) affected by growth opportunities (cash flows) in stronger AOS countries than in weaker AOS countries. We conclude that people's preference for AOS leads firms to suboptimal investment. (c) 2019 Korean Securities Association

While prior work has investigated the impact of (a) ownership structure and (b) board gender diversity separately on corporate environmental performance, researchers have not studied the potentially important relationship between ownership control and female board diversity in influencing corporate environmental performance jointly. We do so in the context of majority ownership in family-controlled and dual-class firms whose motives and influence are theoretically different from that of the firm's minority shareholders. Drawing on resource dependency, socioemotional wealth theory, and secondary agency theory, we hypothesize that majority family owners and dual-class owners likely choose women directors to help advance their personal preferences for environmental corporate social responsibility. Our empirical tests utilizing 2,755 U.S. firm years over the 2010-2015 show that, as hypothesized, these two majority ownership types interact with board gender diversity to positively influence corporate environmental performance.

Integrated reporting (IR) is used to demonstrate a firm's capacity to create value in the short, medium, and long term. It can better represent existing relationships between the company and its stakeholders, with a particular focus on investors. Attention to IR has grown considerably in recent years. However, studies on the determinants of IR quality are still limited. This study aims to bridge this literature gap by being the first study to analyse the role of ownership structure in IR context. To this end, it uses agency theory and is based on a sample of 152 international companies that have adopted IR. The results indicate a positive effect of institutional ownership and a negative effect of ownership concentration, managerial ownership and state ownership on the quality of integrated reports. These results are also consistent with the level of alignment of integrated reports with the <IR> framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the role of ownership structure in the IR policies. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Capital structure is the outcome of market conditions, financial decisions taken by the firm, and credit rationing of fund providers. Research on the capital structure of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has gained momentum in recent years. The present study aims to identify key contributors, key areas, current dynamics, and suggests future research directions in the field of the capital structure of SMEs. This paper adopts a systematic literature review methodology along with bibliometric, network, and content analysis on a sample of 262 studies taken from the Web of Science database to examine the research activities that have taken place on this topic. Most influential papers are identified based on citations and PageRank, along with the most influential authors. The co-citation network is developed to see the intellectual structure of this research area. Applying bibliometric tools, four research clusters have been identified and content analysis performed on the papers identified in the clusters. It is found that the major research focus in this area is around theory testing--mainly, pecking order theory, trade-off theory, and agency theory. Determinants of capital structure, trade credit, corporate governance, and bankruptcy are also the prominent research topics in this field. Also, this study has identified the research gaps and has proposed five actionable research directions for the future. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the role that the chief executive officer (CEO) has on integrated reporting (IR) adoption and whether this role is moderated by incentives to promote corporate transparency, including information asymmetry problems and financial constraints. IR represents the last frontier of corporate disclosure and aims to represent, through the annual integrated report, the ability of an organization to create value over time. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on 10,819 observations (an unbalanced data panel of 1,588 firms for the period 2009-2017). A logistic regression model is used to examine the association between CEO power and disclosure of an integrated report. Findings: The results show that CEOs with greater power oppose the disclosure of integrated information, and this behaviour is not modified by firms' incentives. Furthermore, greater growth opportunities increase CEO opposition to disclosing integrated information on the creation of value, perhaps as a consequence of the possible use of it by competitors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature. First, it expands the scientific debate on the topic of IR. Second, it extends the application field of agency theory, which is seldom used to explain the phenomena related to IR. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine whether board gender diversity reduces the agency costs of firms in the context of Chinese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a large sample of 23,340 firm-year observations of Chinese listed companies during 2004-2017. The authors use ordinary least squares regressions as the primary methodology with a wide range of methods to control for endogeneity and to check robustness, including the fixed-effect method, instrumental variable approach, lagged gender diversity measures, propensity score matching, Blau index, Shannon index and industry-adjusted measures of agency costs. Findings: The evidence reveals that the participation of female directors in corporate board reduces agency costs, which correlates with conflicts of interest. Moreover, gender-diverse boards are more effective in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in which agency issues are more severe. Female directors also provide better monitoring roles in more-developed areas. Finally, corporate boards that have a critical mass of female directors have a greater tendency to reduce agency costs as compared to their token participation. Overall, all findings support the validity of agency theory. Practical implications: This study shows the economic benefit of female directors in the boardroom by reducing agency costs and by improving firms' governance structure. Regarding the government, which is gradually introducing board gender diversity policies, this study provides valuable pragmatic information for Chinese regulators on this issue. Originality/value: This study extends the literature by providing evidence that gender diversity in boardroom matters for shareholders' wealth maximization. It provides novel evidence that a critical mass of female directors is more effective in reducing agency costs compared to a single female on the board, and that the effect of gender diversity varies in relation to ownership structure and region.

Previous literature has found that listed family firms underperform their nonfamily counterparts in terms of environmental performance, but has not explained why this occurs. We address this research gap by hypothesizing that training and development practices (i.e., managerial practices devoted to providing training and development for the workforce) mediate the relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Using a sample of 33,901 firm-year observations from 2002 to 2016 distributed across 56 countries and employing the structural equation model technique, we find that investment in training and development practices explains almost half of the negative relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Our study contributes to the agency theory debate on principal-principal problems by explaining why family blockholders could damage other blockholders and minority shareholders.

Many studies have examined the direct relationship between the two corporate practices: corporate social responsibility (CSR) and earnings management (EM); however, the results remain heterogeneous. To achieve the consensus, this study builds upon the classical agency theory and examines the role of managerial entrenchment in creating organizational facades related to CSR and EM. More specifically, it examines the relationship between CSR performance and EM in the presence of managerial entrenchment and the direct effect of managerial entrenchment on CSR decoupling. In doing so, this article provides evidence of a previously underappreciated yet fundamentally important aspect, that is, managerial entrenchment, that may significantly affect the quality of earnings as well as the level of alignment between CSR disclosure and performance. Our analyses of longitudinal data of an international sample for the period of 2007-2016 supports that managerial entrenchment significantly moderates the relationship between CSR performance and EM. Furthermore, our study reveals that entrenched managers decouple CSR disclosure and performance. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the existing capital structure and board structure literature by examining the relationship among corporate governance, ownership structure and capital structure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a panel data of 595 firm-year observations from a unique and comprehensive data set of 119 Chinese real estate listed firms from 2014 to 2018. It uses fixed effect and random effect regression analysis techniques to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the board size, ownership concentration and firm size have positive influences on capital structure. State ownership and firm profitability have inverse influences on capital structure. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that better-governed companies in the real estate sector tend to have better capital structure. These findings highlight the unique Chinese context and also offer regulators a strong incentive to pursue corporate governance reforms formally and jointly with the ownership structure. Finally, the results suggest investors the chance to shape detailed expectations about capital structure behavior in China. Future research could investigate capital structure using different arrangement, conducting face-to-face meetings with the firm's directors and shareholders. Practical implications: The findings offer support to corporate managers and investors in forming or/and expecting an optimal capital structure and to policymakers and regulators for ratifying laws and developing institutional support to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value: This paper extends, as well as contributes to the current capital structure and corporate governance literature, by proposing new evidence on the effect of board structure and ownership structure on capital structure. The results will help policymakers in different countries in estimating the sufficiency of the available corporate governance reforms to improve capital structure management.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

In this paper, we argue that corruption is likely to increase agency costs of equity, hence shareholders have higher incentives to control managers. When corruption is higher, firm managers need to use firm resources to make unofficial payments and they tend to take this opportunity to expropriate shareholders. Consequently, shareholders recognizing this risk need to force managers to pay more dividends in order to mitigate the agency problem. This paper examines the effects of corruption on dividend decisions in the light of agency theory. With a sample of 205,316 observations from 47 countries, we find that corruption is positively related to both the decision to pay dividends and payout ratio. Moreover, this relationship is stronger under strong creditor protection. (c) 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

This study examines the relationship between corporate non-financial disclosure ratings, the Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, and three outcomes of Italian listed firms: performance, risk and agency cost. Based on stakeholder-agency theory, this study conceptualizes the role of firms' non-financial disclosures in reducing asymmetric information and agency costs between managers and broad stakeholders. Utilizing the Standard Ethics Rating (SER) as a measure of firms' non-financial disclosure rating, this study finds that SER ratings are positively related to firm value and are negatively related to firms' risk and agency costs. This study also provides evidence that the adoption of Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, along with external verifications from the SER of firms' non-financial disclosure, has a positive impact on firm outcomes. Corporate managers and investors should recognize the value added from regulations that foster non-financial disclosures and ratings issued by an independent rating agency (e.g., Standard Ethics) as they both enhance firm performance and reduce risk and agency costs.

Whereas the corporate life cycle hypothesis says firms follow structured goals along their life cycle, others argue that corporate governance objectives vary independently of predetermined life cycle stages. This study examines the impact of the corporate life cycle on corporate governance in emerging markets, where firms can self-select into stricter rules by adopting an exchange listing level that fits the governance needs of the organization independently of life cycle requirements. We find the listing-level decision is a better predictor of corporate governance quality than corporate life cycle. Firms signal improvements in corporate governance by bonding to more stringent regulation; they determine the corporate governance quality that matches their needs at any point during their life-cycle.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

The effectiveness of the well-known corporate governance practices may not be universal due to fundamental differences in the environments under which firms operate. By using hand-collected data from all the non-financial firms listed on the unexplored East African frontier markets (i.e., Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), we examine the effect of board characteristics on the performance of firms. Our results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on firm performance. The presences of foreigners and civil servants on the board play positive roles on financial performance, where the agency and resource dependence theories apply. Further, we find that board members with higher education also contribute to firm performance. These findings still hold when we consider the 2008-2009 financial crisis period. Overall, we show that in a business climate where ownership is largely dominated by few shareholders, the conventional governance mechanisms do not work effectively. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the role of accounting quality as an antecedent of dividend payout decision of firms, for both dividend levels and dividend event, in an emerging market context. Using the data for Indian firms through the years 2006-2016, we evaluate the impact of discretionary accruals on payout decision employing Tobit and Logit regression models amid set of idiosyncratic controls. We report that better earnings quality, on average, is associated with large dividend payments for Indian firms. Moreover, the likelihood of dividend payment reduces with poor earnings quality and more so when earnings manipulation is done to increase earnings. Nonetheless, we show that higher earnings quality reduces dividends during the crisis period and also for group-affiliated firms. However, the same doesn't hold true for dividend likelihood. The relationship is robust to the idiosyncratic controls and the causality test confirms that results are not susceptible to endogeneity issue. Overall, we conclude that better earnings quality takes care of free cash flow problems and alleviates the agency and information asymmetry related costs, thereby stimulating payout policy.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of corporate governance index on the cost of equity in companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. This study collects data from 975 observations during the period 2012 to 2018 to test the hypotheses using multiple linear regression model for the panel data. In this research, the independent variable of corporate governance index comprises of 27 specific corporate governance attributes. The results of hypothesis testing showed that corporate governance has a negative and significant effect on the rate of capital cost. In other words, the quality of corporate governance can lower the rate of capital cost. This result suggests that, by using a powerful corporate governance system and by declining the information asymmetry (increasing transparency) and agency conflict, we would be able to enhance the quality of financial reports. It would strengthen the capital market, attract financial suppliers and investors, and absorb the required financial resources of the firm by a lower rate. The findings of the study suggest that companies are able to reduce the cost of equity by establishing strong corporate governance. This conclusion suggests the importance and effectiveness of corporate governance in the cost of equity. (c) The Author(s).

We examine the relationship between corporate cash holdings and promoter ownership for a sample of Indian non-financial firms. Consistent with the arguments of the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis', our results broadly suggest that promoter ownership is negatively associated with cash holdings, thereby highlighting the role of large owners in preventing cash accretion in an emerging market context. Indicating prominent influence of corporate ownership on cash management, we find that corporate non-promoter ownership is also negatively related with cash holdings. With regard to promoter ownership of foreign entities, our results suggest that cash holdings share a U-shaped relationship with ownership of foreign promoter corporations. In addition, our findings provide weak evidence to support a more pronounced negative association between cash holdings and promoter ownership for group-affiliated firms as compared to non-affiliated firms since the former faces lower financial constraints on account of access to internal capital markets. Finally, we perform long-term effect analysis in order to reinforce robustness of our results. (c) 2020

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 31 Palestinian non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study uses a generalized least square method. Findings: The results show that the effects of board ownership, board independence, audit committee meeting, audit committee size, audit committee financial expertise and risk management are positive and significant on corporate performance while the effects of chief executive officer duality and audit committee size are negative and significant on corporate performance. Practical implications: The results of this paper are important to policymakers, shareholders and directors of companies to make appropriate choices about the board, audit committee characteristics and risk management to protect the interest of different stakeholders, increase the flow of capital and foreign investment into non-financial companies. Social implications: This paper fills a gap in the corporate governance literature by investigating the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance in Palestine as one of the youngest stock exchanges in a region that assists in testing the validity of agency theory in a young and small emerging market context. Originality/value: This paper is the first to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management collectively on corporate performance in Palestine as prior research on these topics has been investigated separately.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to advance the understanding of the links between the presence of independent directors (IDs) on boards and the company value in the specific context of concentrated ownership. The authors apply the framework of agency theory to identify the monitoring effect of IDs in two legal systems - common law and civil law. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test formulated hypotheses using a unique sample of 50 Mauritian and Polish companies listed during the years 2007 to 2015, amounting to a total of 394 observations adopting the fixed effect panel model. Findings: The results of the panel model show a negative relationship between independent directors on boards and company value. Specifically, the effect remains negative for companies operating in the civil law system, whereas the stronger protection offered by common law offsets the effect of concentrated ownership, resulting in a non-correlation between independent directors on board and firm value. Originality/value: This study expands the understanding of the value added by independent directors, addressing their monitoring role in the unfavorable context of concentrated ownership. It also reveals that different legal frameworks of civil law and common law may impact the monitoring performed by independent directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to extend agency theory in the context of tunneling by exploring how different owner types seek private benefits of control. Specifically, we examine how information asymmetries and board representation create different pressures for tunneling for state-owned, business group-owned, and family-owned firms. We tested our hypotheses with a meta-analytic structural equation model. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that the relationship between ownership and tunneling differs across owner types in terms of both directionality and magnitude. Our study offers a substantial theoretical contribution to the principal-principal problem literature by theorizing and testing variations of the problem among owners. Our study also advances our understanding of the role of ownership in firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings have important theory-building implications for the principal-principal literature. Controlling shareholders have been linked to performance outcomes or to tunneling in general, yet little is known about their comparative propensity to engage in tunneling. Our results, however, highlight that the propensity to engage in tunneling varies substantially among controlling shareholders. Furthermore, in the robustness checks, we disconfirm some of the assumptions of the principal-principal literature. This study demonstrates the need to theorize about specific types of ownership and reassess the core arguments of principal-principal theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policymakers interested in mitigating the risk of minority shareholders being expropriated by the controlling shareholder. As the key driver of tunneling appears to be access to private information and knowledge of the firm, we offer recommendations on what policymakers can do to minimize the asymmetry of information.

Corporate environmental performance has become a key focus of business leaders, policy makers, and scholars alike. Today, scholarship on environmental practice increasingly highlights how various aspects of corporate governance can influence environmental performance. However, the prior literature is inconclusive as to whether ownership by insiders (officers and directors) will have positive or negative environmental effects and whether insider voting control or equity control is more salient to environmental outcomes. This article leverages a unique empirical data set of dual-class firms, where insiders have voting rights disproportionate to their equity rights, to shed light on this question. We find that, on average, dual-class firms underperform their single-class peers on environmental measures and that the discrepancy comes from dual-class firms where insiders have more voting control, relative to their equity stake. While small increases in voting control are associated with improved environmental performance, too much (relative to insiders' equity stake) worsens firms' environmental performance. Insider equity control alone has no impact on environmental outcomes. Our findings have important implications for agency theory and environmental scholarship by identifying contingencies on the impact of voting and equity-based incentives. This research casts doubt on the idea that providing insiders with significant voting control will aid environmental performance. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

This study examines whether auditor-client economic bonding and corporate governance moderate the adverse effects of principal-principal agency problems on earnings quality in U.K.-listed family firms. We find that although earnings management is lower in family firms, there is a higher tendency of earnings management for those firms with economic bonding. However, such an impact may be moderated by good governance mechanisms where the latter may alleviate the adverse effects of the lack of auditor independence on the association between earnings management and family firms.

We investigate the association between controlling shareholders' ownership (CS_Own) and firms' leverage decisions in the Singaporean context. We examine whether the impact of ownership concentration on leverage differs across excess and lower control. We report that shareholders with excess control prefer leverage financing for an optimal capital structure and focus on value maximisation rather using leverage as a tool of minority shareholders' expropriation. Our analysis shows that firms capital structure significantly influences by the coalition of shareholders particularly decisions about leverage financing in addition to the firms' specific characteristics and institutional arrangements. Our empirical evidence shows that controlling shareholders with a lower fraction of equity are more concerned about limited holding thus prefer leverage over equity financing to inflate their equity stake to protect them from the potential takeovers and mergers. We report that capital structure decisions in Singapore are linked with the trade-off between the controlling shareholders' target of mitigating firm risk and their non-dilution entrenchment needs. Further, we found an inverted U-shaped association between control ownership and leverage financing. In terms of moderating effect of family-controlled ownership, our findings exhibit that leverage financing is less pronounced for family firms in Singapore due to the under-diversified investment portfolio.

Purpose: Drawing upon agency theory, this study aims to assess the value relevance (VR) of accounting information released by non-financial firms listed on the Kuwait stock exchange for the period of 2015-2018. Also, the influence of institutional ownership level and other explanatory variables, namely, book value per share, earnings per share, growth in assets and changes in financial leverage on share prices is examined. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the Ohlson (1995) model is extended. This study uses panel data analysis and applies appropriate statistical techniques to measure empirical relationships. Findings: The results show that the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms varies over the period of 2015-2018. Book value and earnings have significant and positive effects on share prices. In recent years, the VR of book value information has been growing, while that of earnings information has been declining. Institutional ownership level has a significant and positive influence on the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms. The findings confirm a positive power, signalling growth in assets regarding the share prices. However, no significant relationship between changes in financial leverage and share prices is found. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide evidence of the linkage between VR and institutional ownership level, which promotes the understanding of the influence of institutional investors on a firm's market value. Empirical evidence from Kuwait will have international implications and can serve as a guide for accounting researchers studying other emerging markets. Capital market regulators can provide guidelines in the form of information characteristics and elements of financial statements that need improvement. Finally, the findings assist non-financial listed firms to enhance the quality of accounting information by identifying the strengths and weaknesses in their financial reports. Originality/value: This study extends the previous literature by investigating a relatively new set of data in more depth than that has been examined by prior research, which focusses on the relationship between accounting information and the firm's market value.

We examine whether the proportion of CEO inside debt holdings (pension and deferred compensation) to stock holdings benefit both shareholders and debtholders by relating CEO inside debt to a firm's dividend payout policies. Based on the positive association of CEO inside debt and the propensity and the size of the dividend payout, we find that firms paying their CEOs with large inside debt present the lower cost of debt and default risk, and these benefits transfer to better firm performance and valuation. Moreover, we find that CEO inside debt is related to superior firm performance only in dividend-paying firms. Dividends tend to increase when firms with high agency costs of equity use inside debt. We conclude that dividends serve as a channel through which CEO inside debt compensation mitigates both agency costs of debt and agency costs of equity.

This study tests the catering theory and explores the main determinants of dividend payments across a sample of eleven emerging countries. There is evidence of catering to investor sentiment for dividends in Middle Eastern and North African countries. Dividend payers are mature, profitable, large firms with lower growth opportunities, and high dividend premiums, which supports the catering, lifecycle, and agency theories. Catering behavior persists even after controlling for the effect of Arab Spring. Difference-in-difference analysis shows that countries highly affected by the political transition period are less likely to pay dividends in the post-Arab Spring period than less affected countries. Catering decreases significantly in the post-Arab Spring period as compared with during- and pre-Arab Spring periods, suggesting that investors prefer that managers retain earnings to reinvest and grow during unstable economic conditions. Furthermore, catering persists in countries with high corruption levels and poor legal quality to reduce agency cost, and substitute for weak legal systems with poor enforcement of laws.

In this study we find that firms' use of trade credit significantly facilitates their access to bank loans in the future, suggesting a complementary relationship. Such a relationship is more profound for firms with higher perceived agency costs, i.e., firms with opaque corporate information, firms located in regions with less developed external institutions, and firms at an early stage of existence. Firms switch from trade credit to bank loans as the main source of debt financing as they age. However, the process is slower for firms with a greater level of corporate information opacity and firms located in regions with weak external institutions.

Purpose: This study aims to find the determinants of the capital structure of Islamic banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). The uniqueness of the case of Islamic banks stems from the fact that they are not only subject to the supervision of financial regulatory bodies that organize the banking sector (e.g. central banks) but also subject to the guidelines of Shari'ah law governing their financial transactions, products and contracts. Such characteristics are expected to have an impact on the capital structure decisions of Islamic banks compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research purpose, an empirical model was constructed to describe the relationship between leverage and the independent variables. The empirical model was tested through multivariate regression analysis using a panel data approach of 12 Islamic banks in the GCC for the period 2005-2014. Three types of regression analysis were used as follows: ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effect and random-effect regressions on panel data. Findings: The research findings show that the leverage of Islamic banks in the GCC is positively related to size of the firm (SIZE) and growth opportunity (GROWTH); and it is negatively related to profitability of the firm (ROA), tangibility of the firm's assets (TANG) and financial market development (MRKT). The results indicate that larger Islamic banks tend to be relatively more diversified with higher credit ratings, which lower their cost of funding and relatively increase its profitability and the bank's customer/depositor base. The results also show that higher profitability ratios indicate relatively more internal funds to cover future investments, which leads to less reliance on external funds in the form of debt and/or equity. However, the higher the growth opportunities of Islamic banks, the faster the depletion rate of internal funding, and the more external debt financing is acquired to cover the expansion plans. In addition, the results show that in developed financial markets, savers tend to purchase less traditional depository products, and they prefer to invest directly in the financial markets to avoid higher commissions. The results are in line with the pecking order theory, which states that Islamic banks in the GCC tend to prefer sources of funds that have the least transaction cost and reveal minimal information to competitors. Hence, bank management resort to internally generated funds by its operations rather than acquiring external funds. Furthermore, the results are weakly explained by the agency theory, which states that as the firm assets become more tangible, the required monitoring cost is reduced; and hence, shareholders will have less tendency to raise more debt for the purpose of sharing the monitoring cost with debt holders. Research limitations/implications: This research study contributes to the theory of capital structure in re-validating the findings of a previous theoretical and empirical study on capital structure in the GCC and abroad. It helps understand the capital structure of Islamic banks in comparison with financial and non-financial firms. Future research is recommended in several areas. In terms of the methodology, it is recommended to conduct the research topic surveying management and financial executives of Islamic banks in the GCC; this will validate the results using a triangular approach supported by the findings of this paper. It is also recommended to apply the research methodology in other parts of the world where Islamic banking exists. Finally, as studies on the capital structure of financial institutions and other regulated sectors are rare, it is recommended to intensify research effort in these sectors to strengthen our knowledge of capital structure. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, this research bridges the gap between theory and practice in many aspects. The findings can serve Islamic bank executives as guidelines to understand the market and competitive reaction in response to capital structure decisions. On the other hand, research analysts and equity holders can use the findings in their debt and equity research valuations, assessment of the size of dividends and profit distributions, and to make more informed decisions to buy/sell financial securities. Furthermore, the findings help regulatory bodies to issue informed regulations in relation to capital adequacy ratios, reserve requirements, provisions and payout decisions to achieve policy intended purpose. In addition, organizations that are responsible for setting accounting and audit standards for Islamic banks will learn more about the industry practice; and hence, be able to pass practical standards. Moreover, the findings realize the recommendations of international financial regulatory bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and other concerned organizations that emphasize the importance of further understanding of financial institution practices, to enable more effective formulation of risk management techniques, which may prevent future financial crisis. Originality/value: This paper was amongst the few research studies conducted on determinants of capital structure in the GCC and specifically on the Islamic banking sector.

From an agency theory perspective, we find the increase of stock liquidity will lead to more dividend payouts. There are two potential channels, the 'outcome hypothesis' (La Porta et al. 2000) and the 'creditors substitute hypothesis' (Brockman and Unlu 2009), through which stock liquidity could increase dividend payouts. We confirm that stock liquidity influences dividend payouts mainly through the latter. (c) 2019, (c) 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Corporate governance plays a decisive role in the financial performance a firm. While the majority of the firms in China and India are owned a managed by its promoters, the present study attempts to examine the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on firm value for these two economies. The study employs panel data methodology with industry and time fixed effects on a sample of 1,042 firms listed in National Stock Exchange India and 450 firms listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange of China. The study finds promoter ownerships to positively impact a firm's value creation process, while institutional investors exert a negative influence. Although CEO duality enhances firm value in China, the results show otherwise for Indian firm Additionally, while board independence is positively correlated to firm value India, it has a negative effect on firms in China. Finally, the study finds that larger board size contributes favorably toward better decision making. (c) 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

Family business literature shows that family and nonfamily firms differ with respect to their financial reporting decisions. However, although the literature on financial reporting in family firms has developed over the last ten years, it is mostly oriented towards earnings management and management control issues. Given the specific characteristics of family firms in financing and governance, do their published accounting data have less value relevance for public investors than in the case of non-family firms? How do family firms differ from one another on this issue? While different theoretical perspectives have been used to tackle this problem, two main theses based on agency theory were the most frequently called upon. In fact, the views of interests' alignment and entrenchment are competing in explaining the differential quality of family and non-family firms accounting numbers. This paper draws on this theoretical lens and contributes to filling this research gap by conducting a comparative analysis of earnings' value relevance for a sample of quoted French family and non-family firms. First, it examines whether family firms show more or less relevant accounting earnings than non-family firms. Second, it seeks to study the heterogeneity of family firms in terms of earnings figures' relevance by considering the extent of family control and the involvement of a family CEO as mechanisms leading to alignment or entrenchment. The findings show that family firms exhibit better earnings' value relevance than non-family firms. In addition, when owning families' control becomes high, earnings' value relevance worsens, which suggests a possible entrenchment effect on behalf of controlling families.

We investigate whether diversification affects bank risk taking in the U.S. banking industry, and whether this relation is partially explained by agency theory. Our results show that U.S. banks with a relatively high share of noninterest income become riskier when moving toward non-interest-income-generating activities, especially activities from investment banking, proprietary trading, and so on. Diversification not only affects conditional average risk, but also the dispersion of risk. Moreover, diversified banks that received assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) become riskier than diversified nonrecipients after TARP capital injections. Our main findings are robust to a battery of robustness tests. The results are partially explained under agency frameworks related to poor corporate governance.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ownership structure on merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions of Brazilian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an applied and explanatory research based on secondary data. The sample is comprises non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa between 1998 and 2007. Considering that the dependent variable is binary, the authors estimate panel data logistic regression models. Considering the existence of conflicts of interest among those who have the decision-making power and the supplier of capital for M&A transactions, they draw upon the Agency Theory to develop the theoretical hypotheses. Findings: The results show that, for a sample of Brazilian non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa (B3), from 1998 to 2007, Brazilian firms present, on average, a highly concentrated ownership structure and the major controlling shareholders are families or the State. These characteristics are negatively related to the likelihood of M&A transactions, as most of these controlling shareholders are reluctant to adopt mechanisms that reduce their control. Research limitations/implications: With regard to the limitations, this study considered only the M&A definitions as stated by the Bureau van Dijk database. In this sense, future studies may analyze the effects of ownership structure based on other M&A definitions and typologies. In addition, the study is limited to the period from 1998 to 2007, which is prior to the international financial crisis. Future studies may extend the analysis period to include the post-crisis period (2008) to check if there are differences in M&A strategies before and after the crisis. Practical implications: From a managerial perspective, the results show that minority shareholders have little or no influence over an M&A decision, so they cannot decide on the use of resources for fast growth and access to new markets through M&A. Thus, the investment decision must take into account the nature and the quality of the controlling shareholder. Social implications: This study shows a significant and negative effect of ownership concentration on the likelihood of M&A transactions. In part, this result demonstrates the importance of understanding the behavior of controlling shareholders before inferring on other key aspects that the M&A literature tends to make fundamental in explaining M&A decisions in publicly traded companies, particularly, in an environment of low minority shareholder protection. Originality/value: Previous studies have partly found that the M&A decision is motivated by individual advantages obtained from increasing the size of the firm, or from managerial hubris. The results show that these hypotheses do not hold in the Brazilian context. Moreover, the results indicate that M&A decisions are associated with the characteristics of the controlling shareholder, their level of ownership concentration and their typology, contributing to the agency debate on whether the incentive or the entrenchment effect prevails in the context of the agency problem between controlling and minority shareholders, particularly, in an institutional environment of low shareholder protection.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Earnings management behavior is the use of accounting procedures, through accounting policies, to intentionally purposeful control in the provision of information to users. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between ownership structure factors and earnings management behavior of 30 Vietnamese commercial banks. The paper uses the ordinary least square method to examine this relationship and employs time series data of 15 years from 2005 to 2019. The study also uses agency theory an asymmetric information theory. The authors examined six independent variables related to the ownership structure and these variables are typical of Vietnamese commercial banks. The results of the study show that the foreign ownership ratio is an opposite effect, while the ownership concentration variable has a positive effect on earnings management behavior of Vietnamese commercial banks. Based on that, the article proposes a number of policy suggestions for the State bank of Vietnam and Board of directors of commercial banks as well as investors to identify and to limit the earnings management behaviors of Vietnamese commercial banks. This contributes to ensuring information transparency as well as improving the quality of accounting information of Vietnamese commercial banks in the coming years. (c) Copyright: The Author(s).

Based on the agency theory, this paper analyzes whether family firms pay more dividends compared to no-family firms and identifies whether the board composition affects the dividend policy. Brazil and Chile have established mandatory dividends, retain lower cash holdings, pay higher dividends compared with other markets in the region. The sample of study is composed by 853 observations from 49 Brazilian and 32 Chilean top publicly listed firms in terms of market capitalization over the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. Using an unbalanced panel data, results indicate that family controlled firms distribute more dividends and board composition namely; board size and the proportion of women on the board have a significant and positive impact on the dividend policy of the firm. By contrast, Chairman of Board - Chief Executive Office (COB-CEO) duality signficantly. Thus, dividend policy constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism in mitigating the family' expropriation of minority shareholders' wealth. (c) 2021 European Journal of Family Business.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to answer the research question: How do cooperative organizations perform when created by government fiat in an emerging market? Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social-political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-a-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the theoretical assumption about a weaker role of internal governance structures (namely, board and CEO) in determining sporting and financial performances in highly concentrated club ownership environment. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the Italian and English football clubs playing in their national top divisions, over the period 2006-2015, the authors apply agency theory, property rights theory and win maximization logic to test the absence of a significant impact of internal governance structures on financial performances and clubs' sporting performance. Ownership structure's variables are used as control variable. Findings: Empirical findings document an overall poor impact of board structure and CEO features on financial performances, in comparison with the influence of ownership structure; the consolidation of win maximization logic of clubs' owners has been demonstrated in this specific context. However, the authors found that some internal governance elements have also an impact on performance even if their contribute is limited: board size results negatively associated to club profitability, board independence and CEO tenure are positively related to sporting performance; in addition, CEO tenure also increases profitability. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies on the contribution arising from this empirical research, since a scarcity of empirical studies analyzing the correlation between internal governance and performance in European football sector is noticed.

Considering that principal-principal conflicts in companies under mixed public-private ownership are substantially different from the typical agency conflict model, this paper's objective is to analyze principal-principal conflicts in mixed ownership companies in the Brazilian electric power industry. In order to expand understanding of the phenomenon which we are studying, we have integrated the assumptions that underlie agency theory and institutional theory, using a qualitative approach and collecting data during semi structured interviews with companies' board members. Data was analyzed and interpreted as per Bardin (2006), with the aid of ATLAS(r)ti software. Our main findings suggest that while a government stake in a firm's ownership structure can provide a useful channel for the government to seek support and resources, in counterpoint, it can also create distortions and uncertainties, and exacerbate principal-principal conflicts. The development of stronger institutions and corporate governance could bring about useful options for providing checks and balances and, in the final analysis, mitigate principal-principal conflict. The article contributes to the literature by providing additional elements that are not available in public reports. Analysis of the conflict between principal and principal, together with theoretical integration, seek to broaden the understanding of this theme. (c) 2020 FUCAPE Business School. All rights reserved.

I examine the influence of large and small institutional investors on different components of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, using US data for 2006-2015. An increase in large institutional ownership reduces total pay and current incentive compensation (i.e., options, stocks, bonus pay), whereas small institutional investors lower long-term incentive pay (i.e., pension, deferred pay, stock incentive pay). These findings are consistent with managerial agency theory and the substitution of incentive pay by institutional monitoring. The effects are stronger for higher ownership levels and firms with weak governance, less financial distress, long-tenured CEOs, multiple segments, and more free cash flow.

A dual-class share structure creates a separation between cash flow rights and voting rights. Dual-class firms impact audit fees through their effect on supply/demand for auditing. This article examines the association between audit fees and dual-class share structure for U.S. public firms. We find that a dual-class share structure is associated with lower audit fees compared to single-class firms. Further, within dual-class firms, we find that the divergence between cash flow rights and voting rights is negatively associated with audit fees. The results are consistent with the managerial incentive-alignment effect and/or the insulation effect of a dual-class share structure on the supply/demand for audit services. This study highlights that the ownership structure of a firm constitutes an important role in audit pricing. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the strength of corporate governance influences the firm's ability to retain their key knowledge workers or inventors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper links agency and innovation theory to develop the hypotheses. Agency theory predicts that the interests of employees are counter to those of firm owners. The authors predict that as shareholder power grows as corporate governance strengthens, inventors who are highly productive, and those who pursue risky but valuable exploratory innovation will leave the firm. Given prior scholarship in innovation theory establishing the critical contributions that new knowledge creation and exploratory innovation make to firms' competitive advantage, the authors consider whether stronger firm-level corporate governance leads to the erosion of the firm's competitive advantage. The hypotheses are empirically tested using generalized least squares estimation on a data set that combines data on firms, their patents and the governance provisions these firms adopt. Findings: Using a 10-year sample of publicly traded US firms, the authors find that stronger corporate governance erodes the very foundation of a firm's innovation capabilities. Stronger corporate governance reduces management job security, which makes managers more risk-averse. This heightened "managerial myopia" results in increased departures of highly valuable inventors employed by the firm. The authors show that these departing inventors are more productive inventors than those who remain and engage in more exploratory R&D than the remaining inventors at the firm. Originality/value: The findings raise questions on the appropriateness of the adoption of governance provisions strengthening shareholder rights in firms pursuing innovation.

We examine the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings and the interplay of family ownership on this relationship through static and dynamic panel estimation models. Composite indicator for the corporate governance based on several proxies related to corporate board structure and ownership is constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). Our evidence is based on a sample of 120 publicly listed non-financial firms from Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) over the period 2013-2017. The selected sample is further divided into family and non-family firms based on 10% or more ownership. We document the negative impact of corporate governance on cash holdings. The findings reveal that family ownership as a moderator weakens the impact of corporate governance mechanism on cash holdings. The analysis of individual proxies of corporate governance and cash holdings in the whole sample, as well as sub-sample, provides some new insights that family firms with more board size, board independence, and institutional shareholdings hold more cash as compared to non-family firms. The study theoretically supports the agency theory. The study suggests that individual market participants may make investment decisions thereby keeping in view the role of family ownership. The study also provides better insights to regulatory authorities to design policies in such a way that ensure the protection of minority shareholders as corporate cash holdings decisions are different in family and non-family firms.

This study is a response to increasing interests in corporate social responsibility (CSR) after the announcement of ISO26000 and investments in South Korea. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between CSR activities and accounting transparency. To this end, CSR was divided into two categories in this study: strategic and defensive CSR. The study employed two different theories-agency theory and stakeholder theory--to explain the relationship between two different kinds of CSR and earnings management, using data from the Korea Economic Justice Institute (KEJI) index from 2013 to 2017. The samples were divided into two groups: Chaebol firms and all firms including both chaebol and non-chaebol firms, of which KEJI score was available. A modified Jones model was employed to estimate earnings management. Two major findings were drawn from this study. For all firms, the study found a negative and significant relationship between defensive CSR and earnings management. For chaebol firms only, a positively significant relationship was found between strategic CSR and earnings management. This study contributes to a better understanding of Korean firms' CSR activities and their motivations. Copyright (c) 2020 GMP Press and Printing.

Numerous studies have investigated whether regulation substitutes for or complements internal governance. The results have been inconclusive due to their over reliance on agency theory and extensive use of demographic proxy variables to real board activities. We empirically investigate the relationship between government performance evaluation (GPEs) and internal monitoring by SOE boards in the context of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs), overcoming the limitations of existing empirical studies. This analysis is enabled by data collected from the 1,525 board minutes of 170 Korean SOEs. Our prior expectation is a substitutive relationship. First, the similarity of GPE and internal monitoring by the board makes the relative cost of internal monitoring more expensive. Second, GPEs only reward managers, leaving outside directors unpaid. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation, and indicate that even in heavily regulated SOEs, internal imperatives outweigh institutional pressure. Hence, policy makers should carefully design GPEs so as not to crowd-out the potential benefit of internal monitoring by SOE boards. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

There are two competing views in explaining the motives of related party transactions (RPTs): an efficient contracting arrangement to benefit shareholders and a mean for insiders to expropriate outside shareholders via self-dealing. This study hypothesizes that, in Taiwan, a quasi-developed economic unity with high vertical-integrated products and services, a firm's different types of revenue-related RPTs will reflect its diverse characteristics and result in a distinctive earnings informativeness. We use both the product (or processing) sales and non-operating revenues to examine how RPTs influence the amount of current and future earnings embedded in current stock returns. The empirical results show that earnings informativeness is enhanced for firms disclosing high related-party's product (or processing) sales, yet it deteriorates for firms reporting high related-party' non-operating revenues. It suggests the sub-classification of revenue-related RPTs has implication to investors. We run some diagnostic checks and document results that are robust for various specifications.

We examine the effect of international acquisitions on CEO compensation for US firms from 1995 to 2016 using both domestic acquisition and no acquisition firms as benchmarks. We find that acquisitions lead to a greater increase in CEO compensation (especially incentive-based compensation), which is consistent with agency theory and inconsistent with stewardship or reputation theory. We also find that international acquisitions lead to a greater increase in CEO incentive-based compensation than domestic acquisitions, supporting matching theory given that international acquisitions are larger and more complex to manage. Additionally, we document that CEO tenure has a positive effect on CEO compensation, whereas firm relatedness has a negative effect on post-acquisition CEO compensation. This is the first study of its type based on comprehensive data, and it contributes to our understanding of the role of international and domestic acquisitions in CEO compensation.

Purpose: As widely known and well established, strategic decision-making at family firms is an interface between business interests and family considerations. The purpose of this paper is to understand the underlying basis of decision-making in setting corporate strategy and designing chief executive officer (CEO) compensation at founder- vis-a-vis descendant-led family firms in the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 BSE-listed pharmaceutical companies have been studied over the period 2012-2017 resulting in a total of 636 firm-year observations. Impact of family involvement in business (FIB) on corporate strategy and CEO compensation has been analysed by constructing multivariate panel data regression models. To deal with the problem of endogeneity, Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel data estimation procedure has moreover been conducted. Findings: Supporting stewardship theory, founder-owned and governed firms have been found to favour "growth" strategy and distribute "conservative" executive pay, thereby exerting a positive moderating impact on the strategy-compensation linkage. On the contrary, descendants/second-generation entrepreneurs have put forth a "conservative" stance for growth and innovation, and have rather been observed to favour a "liberal" compensation policy, thereby showcasing the application of behavioural agency theory. Originality/value: The research is a novel attempt to unravel the interaction between corporate strategy and CEO compensation in a family firm backdrop carried out in the context of an emerging economy. The study, moreover, adopted an all-encompassing definition of FIB (ownership, management and governance). (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Objective - The registration and disclosure of the company's accounting information, attributed to the accounting professional, is of utmost importance for the decision making process for the company-manager. This theoretical essay presents and discusses the main contributions of the theory on management decision making between the company and the accounting process. Methodology - In methodological terms, this study is defined as a theoretical essay, in the sense that it seeks, through the existing literature, an understanding of the issue of Corporate Governance in Non-Governmental Organizations. This study can be classified as a theoretical-conceptual bibliographic research. The study will search the existing literature of the theme, with the purpose of elaborating a theoretical reference on Agency Theory, Accounting and Corporate Governance. Results - As a contribution to the discussion, this work was developed from extensive bibliographic research in Brazilian and international journals and events, contemplating foundations related to the reality of Accounting and organizations. Although few researches address the association of these theories with accounting practice, especially regarding the production of accounting information for external users, the research findings expose the close relationship between the two fields of knowledge. Contributions - Among the main contributions of decision theories to accounting science, knowledge about human behavior that can be used in behavioral accounting, the need for subsidies for accountants to make more rational decisions and, especially, the possibility of improving accounting systems, aiming at better treatment of information for the decision-making process, stand out.

Purpose: Based on the institutionalized agency theory, this paper aims to analyses the role of earnings management (EM) in mediating the relationship between ownership structure (OS) and the cost of equity capital (COE). Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above relationship by investigating a sample of 249 European non-financial listed companies during 2005-2012. The authors adopt different measures for both EM and COE and identify three main types of ownership by the majority share of the ultimate owners. Path analysis is used to explore the role of direct, mediated (i.e. EM) and total effects of OS on COE. Findings: While OS directly affects COE, the results support the idea that an EM-mediating effect contributes to further explain this relationship in some ownership structures. Particularly European listed family-owned firms experience lower COE owing to the prevailing direct and negative effect of OS, despite the fact that both accrual and real EM mediate and have a positive effect on COE. In financial institutions-owned firms, only a direct and positive effect can be observed on COE while state-owned firms do not have a direct influence on the COE, although they do reduce real EM, which, in turn, decreases the COE in a mediated effect. Further analysis comparing the Anglo-Saxon context with Continental Europe shows more detailed results. Practical implications: The study marks its entry into the international debate on the evolution in the value relevance of accounting information by arguing that the COE implications of EM depend on institutional factors such as OS and the context investigated. Originality/value: The paper contributes to extant finance, accounting and corporate governance literature by providing new, robust evidence on the mediating role of EM in defining COE for different ownership types and their diverse risk-taking propensities in Continental Europe, which differs from the Anglo-Saxon context both institutionally and legally.

This study examines the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and financial structure decision among Malaysian public listed companies for the year ended 2013 using the agency theory. Ordinary Least Square regression is used to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on company's financial structure decision. The independent variables include board size, directors' remuneration, CEO duality, tenure of CEO, and institutional ownership. The control variable is represented by firm's size, whereas the dependent variable is financial structure decision. The results indicate that directors' remuneration and firm's size have a positive significant relationship with the financial structure decision. The corporate governance is developed to reduce the agency costs and ensuring the separation of ownership and management to protect the shareholder's rights. This aligns with corporate finance theories, which suggest that financial structure is one of the elements that contribute to the agency cost, while corporate governance is a tool that can mitigate the agency issues.

Purpose: One aspect of agency theory suggests that dominant shareholders use the firm's assets for their personal benefits and 1thus expropriate minority shareholders (tunneling). Accordingly, this paper aims to examine the effect of capital structure and cash holding decisions on minority shareholders' expropriation for short and long periods. Design/methodology/approach: Data of 16 years (2000-2015) has been obtained from 200 non-financial firms registered at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The study used fixed effect and autoregressive distributed lagged to obtain the results. Findings: The results suggest that the presence of more debts in capital structure is positively associated with minority shareholders' expropriation, whereas a negative association has been found between the level of cash holding and minority shareholders expropriation. These results have been observed as significant both for the short and long run. Research limitations/implications: This study also suggests some important measures to control minority shareholders' expropriation by the dominant shareholders and thus to protect their rights. Originality/value: There is a lack of literature for this severe issue in the developing countries especially Pakistan, so this study narrates the potential measures to the regulatory authority of the market to curb tunneling and to protect minority shareholders.

The results show that firms with combined leadership structure are more diversified while firms with more independent directors are less diversified. There is a U-shaped relationship between ownership concentration and diversification. No significant association between country-level shareholder protection and diversification is demonstrated.

Purpose: Although principal-agent theory has gained a prominent place in research, its negative image of self-serving managers is frequently criticized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how existing theories of agency and stewardship can be combined by using behavioral characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed articles on the behavior of agents and stewards from the domains of finance, economics, management, corporate governance and organizational research. Additional theoretical and meta-analytical empirical literature from the fields of psychology and sociology was used to account for general patterns of human behavior. Findings: The results indicate that goal congruency and the perception of fairness can serve as moderators distinguishing agency theory and stewardship theory. Goal congruency can be achieved by stipulating psychological ownership. The perception of distributive and procedural fairness is demonstrated by two major corporate governance mechanisms: performance-based compensation and board monitoring. The results are summarized in six hypotheses that allow a situational, customized corporate governance. These hypotheses can be tested in future research. Originality/value: Prior work either focused on the merits of principal-agent theory or advocates the utilization of positive management theories, such as stewardship theory. However, little work has been done on bridging the gap between both constructs and develop a more extensive view of management theory. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the strength of corporate governance and the value of firm-level investment policies following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 and the associated changes to the listing requirements of major stock exchanges. In particular the authors seek to examine potential changes in the market's assessed value of capital expenditures after the passage of the SOX Act relative to before. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a difference-in-difference methodology, centred on the year of the passage of the SOX Act to test for the role of governance on the marginal value of capital expenditures. Excess stock returns are calculated by subtracting Fama and French (1993) size and book-to-market portfolio value-weighted returns from the firms' annual stock returns. Each firm is grouped into one of 25 size and book-to-market portfolios for each year in the sample, with size and the book-to-market ratio proxying for sensitivity to common risk factors in stock returns (Fama and French, 1993). Findings: The authors find that markets responded to the change in governance brought about by the new regulation by altering the value of firm-level capital expenditures in a way that is generally consistent with predictions of agency theory. While the overall findings imply a reduction in agency conflicts post-SOX, there is some evidence that certain firms may have suffered excessive costs of compliance, while still others saw managers become excessively risk averse. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications related to the efficacy of legislation. Cross-sectional variation in the effect of SOX on the marginal value of capital expenditures suggests that one-size-fits-all legislative approach can have both expected as well as unintended consequences. The study limits its analysis to examining the impact of three significant provisions of the Act. While, the value implications of the Act are largely captured by the selected three, a more comprehensive study could expand on the set of provisions studies to obtain a more granular level impact. Practical implications: This research should add to the growing body of the literature examining the effect of SOX on firms' real activities and decisions, as well as contribute to the debate on whether the Act was beneficial or costly to firms. With particular reference to the impact of capital expenditure on firm value, the research contributes to the sparse literature examining the contribution of capital expenditures to firm value and the role that agency conflicts play in this relationship. Additionally, this research adds to the growing body of the literature that examines the costs and benefits of the sweeping new regulations brought on by the adoption of SOX. Social implications: Given the importance of investment policy for economic productivity and growth, the insights provided by findings in this research should benefit lawmakers both within the USA as well as in countries where corporate misconduct and fraud is a concern. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the impact of the SOX Act on the way capital markets value firm-level investment in capital expenditures. Since use of corporate resources by managers is fraught with agency conflicts, the role of SOX in potentially alleviating this conflict as revealed by the tests in this study are very valuable.

Orientation: Agency theory predicts that agency relationships are subject to the principal-agent problem. Other theories also suggest that executives may tend to maximise sales revenues, or expand their spans of influence through growth, at the expense of the net value of the firm or its profitability. Research purpose: The purpose of this study is to test which forms of company performance are associated with higher executive variable pay ratios or determine the proportion of variable director remuneration to total remuneration. Motivation for the study: The extent to which variable remuneration is associated with different types of firm performance is unclear. Research design, approach and method: This study applies a simple panel regression model to test the extent to which the variable ratio of total director remuneration contributes differently to increases in firm revenue, total assets, return on assets, or measures of Tobin's Q. These relationships are tested for listed companies on South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, South Africa, for the years 2011-2014. Main findings: Variable remuneration is found to be negatively and strongly related to total revenue and negatively and weakly related to total assets (the gross measures of performance). In contrast, variable remuneration is weakly and positively related to Tobin's Q, a measure which better reflects the interests of shareholders than gross measures. Practical/managerial implications: Firms in this context should seek to strengthen the linkages between variable remuneration and forms of performance that reflect the interests of stakeholders. Contribution/value-add: In the wake of global and local governance failures, this study suggests that the use of the variable component of executive remuneration might be helpful in aligning stakeholder interests. Further research might seek to better understand the causal mechanisms that underlie these findings. (c) AOSIS (pty) Ltd. All rights reserved.

The field of corporate governance can to a large extent be traced back the aftermath of the Great Depression 1929. The problem which led to the crash of the stock market was described as a division between control and ownership. The problem was described as managerialism. The thesis of managerialism inspired agency theory which has been synonymous with corporate governance theory. The theory focuses on the shareholder perspective and the importance of maximizing profits. Although corporate legitimacy has become a more important concept within institutional theory, it has had limited influence on the corporate governance discourse. That is, however, likely to change as the importance of the stakeholder perspective is growing. To align corporate governance with stakeholder perspective and strive for corporate legitimacy will have profound effects on the role of boards and corporate governance.

We update and review the current literature on IPO underpricing and performance, stressing the link with corporate governance at the country and firm-level. We focus on the separation between ownership and control and the signaling that firms' governance structure could send to the IPO market. It is clear from this review that improvements in governance institutions tend to reduce underpricing and affect IPO performance positively, but it is not entirely clear how governance at the firm level could impact IPOs' underpricing and performance. As shown, there are many interesting avenues for further research in this area. (c) 2020, AfricaGrowth Institute. All rights reserved.

This paper looks at managerial diversion and agency theory and how both arguments may be applied to describe the governance practices and performance of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia. Managers are the main focus of the approaches, on the assumption that managers tend to expropriate the firms' and shareholders' value for their own benefit instead of looking for ways to maximize shareholders' value and fulfill their stakeholders' needs. Indonesia is selected because it has the highest number of State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) companies among the ASEAN countries. The government holds more than 51 percent of the shares and has a unique governance structure with two-tier boards to manage and run the companies. Besides, most of Indonesia's SOE companies have a tight connection with Indonesia's political party. With these characteristics, the agency problem in Indonesia's SOE companies is more prevalent compared to other listed SOE companies. The managerial diversion, which is linked to corruption, might be the principal critical factor that hinders SOE companies from performing well. Thus, even with the introduction of a good corporate governance score by the Indonesian government, which is imposed on SOE companies, it may not be able to improve the overall financial performance of SOEs as well as governance practice in the companies. This paper's objective is to review and examine prior literature on corporate governance and managerial diversion from the perspective of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia.

Motivated by the agency theory and the need to examine the effect of separation of ownership and management, this study examines the determinants of profitability in different firm ownership structures and how different ownership structures impact the profitability of listed firms between 2003 and 2013, using pooled annual data of 23 Ghanaian listed firms. Employing a number of static models (OLS, Random Effects and 3 Stage Least Squares), we find evidence that while profit determinants vary for listed firms given their ownership structures, ownership structures also affected profitability differently. Specifically, for listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, age and GDP; for non-family owned listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, market share and age; for foreign-owned firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, age and GDP; and for non-foreign ownership, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, growth, age and GDP. When we examine the impact of ownership structure on profitability and find that family-owned listed firms make 30% less profits compared to non-family owned ones, whilst foreign-owned firms make 13% more profits than non-foreign owned ones. These findings confirm the agency theory which posits that separation of ownership and management, though may lead to agency problems, can positively affect profits. The study recommends that family-owned listed firms should consider diluting ownership in order to grow more profits. (c) 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

The study aimed to investigate the extent and level of risk management disclosures of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and to examine the relationship between risk management disclosures and financial performance. Using quota sampling, 160 firms were used as the samples. Content analysis by word counting was used to quantify risk management disclosures in corporate annual reports during 2017 to 2019, while financial performance and corporate characteristics were collected from samples' websites. Descriptive analysis, correlation matrix, and panel data analysis by pooled OLS regression were used to analyze data. As the results, the study found that the average level of risk management disclosures in annual reports of Thai listed companies during 2017 to 2019 were 2226.11 words. In more details, operational risk management disclosure was the most common disclosure following by following by financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, contingency risk, and major shareholder risk. Moreover, the study found the positive relationship between major shareholder risk management disclosure and financial performance, while financial risk management disclosure had negative influenced on financial performance. The study demonstrated agency theory that can be used to explain risk management disclosures in Thailand where the disclosures were not mandatory reporting yet. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

From the traditional agency theory perspective, managers may hide rent extraction through tax aggressiveness and social responsibility activities. Existing theories propose that greater managerial ownership generates greater alignment of the interests of managers and shareholders and thus reduces the agency costs. On the other hand, increasing managerial ownership may entrench managers, causing agency conflicts between the controlling owner who is also the manager and minority shareholders. Using a sample of Taiwanese listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study investigates whether socially responsible firms are less or more tax aggressive, and whether this relationship will be impacted by managerial ownership. This study finds that firms with high CSR have higher effective tax rates, supporting the stakeholder theory. In addition, this study finds that firms with higher managerial ownership are less tax aggressive, consistent with the alignment effect argument. This study finds only limited evidence that managerial ownership has a moderating effect on the negative relation between CSR and tax aggressiveness. However, when managers own a significant equity ownership, this study finds no evidence that managerial ownership moderates the negative relationship between CSR and tax aggressiveness. This suggests that owner-managers might increase CSR activities to mask their rent extraction through tax aggressive activities. Copyright (c) 2020 Journal of Accounting Review. All rights reserved.

This study examines the relevance of board independence to stock return volatility for a sample of 160 companies listed on the Vietnamese stock market over ten years (2008-2017). After controlling for potential endogeneity, we find that the presence of non-executive directors on the board tends to increase firm risk. The results indicate that non-executive directors do not play a supervisory role under the agency theory. Our findings remain robust when we apply alternative measures of the dependent variable.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance.

Within the realm of corporate finance, IPO (refers to the process of offering shares of corporation to the public for the first time) companies in Malaysia received little attention from the academic scholarly works. An important area of inquiry for IPO companies is to investigate the board characteristics impact on dividend initiation. With use of the agency theory principles, four argumentative hypotheses were proposed. The current study used a pooled cross-sectional data with a total sample size of 372 companies listed in the Malaysian Stock Market. The results of this study revealed that the independence of board and the size of board were found to have a positive and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend for IPO companies. However, multi-seats were found to have a negative and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend. But, CEO duality were found to be irrelevant to the decision of initiating dividend.

At present, many economies are suffering from environmental problems that have significant effects on the climate and life of human beings, thus, the governments and institutions work to reduce the industrial negative effects on the environment. Based on the Porter Hypothesis, agency theory, and management and organization theory, this study examines the connection between environmental regulations, corporate social responsibility and firm innovation with the moderating role of CEO power and ownership concentration. Importantly, this study divided CEOs into male and female CEO. This study classifies firm innovation into two kinds, such as firm input innovation and firm output innovation. This study selects the sample of Pakistani manufacturing firms and uses the panel data for the period 2008 to 2018. For the analysis purpose, this study employs ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effect (FE) model, generalized method of moments (GMM). For more robust results, this study employs the feasible generalized least square (FGLS) model. Based on the findings from the empirical analysis, this study concludes that environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility have a positive relationship with firm innovation (Input and Output). Moreover, a powerful CEO and ownership concentration are valuable for firm innovation (Input and Output), because these factors are positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output). Majorly, this study contends that environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility are positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output) because of the interactive role of CEO power. This study supported the role of both male and female CEOs for firm innovative practices. Therefore, firms of developing economies should also consider the female CEO. Besides, environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility also positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output) because of the interactive role of ownership concentration. Moreover, this study offers various policy implications for governments and policymakers. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

We examine the relative merits of state (SOE) and private (POE) ownership on firm invention output in emerging as well as developed economies. Firm SOE affords a vehicle by which governments throughout the world encourage risky investment in new technological paths. Yet, from a traditional agency-theoretical standpoint, SOEs are plagued by low-powered incentives and dysfunctional involvement (e.g., wasteful budgets and political meddling), which reduces SOE performance, relative to POEs. To examine this paradox, we build an extended agency model which, rather than overlooking agency cost drivers, entertains a more balanced view, in which these so-called agency "liabilities" in fact benefit SOEs, particularly in the sphere of inventions. We argue that, given relatively higher levels of managerial autonomy, SOEs may outperform POEs in some types of inventive output. We further propose that key boundary conditions operate to modify this base effect, in that contexts lacking political constraints - a condition found in most emerging economies - increase the risk of political meddling, reducing managerial autonomy so that any SOE inventive advantages wane significantly. We also hypothesize that this negative effect of weak institutions is attenuated in high invention productivity sectors. Empirically, we track the frequency, pioneerism, and impact of patent inventions of 521 SOEs and matched POEs for 16 years, across 43 countries and 22 industries. We find empirical support for our hypotheses based on a robust set of fixed-effects regression analyses, aided by a battery of checks to assess self-selection and omitted variable bias.

This study investigates the impact of ownership structure on the dividend policy in Jordan. In particular, it aims to uncover the effects of family ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership, and state ownership on dividend decisions for a sample of 66 Jordanian industrial and service firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the period 2014-2017. Tobit Panel Regression is used to test the hypotheses of the study. The results show a significant positive association between institutional ownership and dividend yield, while foreign ownership is associated with a less likelihood of paying dividends. No evidence is found to support that family ownership and state ownership have an impact on dividend yield. Hence, the study provides a clear evidence that high institutional ownership as an external control mechanism increases the need to pay dividends. The results also indicate that Jordanian listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures and are mainly dominated by families followed by financial institutions, then foreign investors while the state shows relatively lower ownership. The study recommends that investors should take into account ownership structure when making investment decisions to help them choose the best investment opportunities. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Corporate governance disclosures form a key part of a company's non-financial reporting. Several studies consider the determinants of corporate governance reporting, including external factors such as country-specific legislation and scandals, and internal factors such as financial performance, size and culture. Others consider the consequences of corporate governance reporting, using simple proxies for corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition characteristics to analyse the impact on financial reporting quality and company valuation. Yet the determinants and consequences of corporate governance reporting may be interlinked, and many quantitative studies fail to consider these links and their multiple effects adequately. Poor financial performance, for example, can be both a determinant and a consequence of the underlying governance mechanisms that corporate governance reporting aims to capture. The framework provided in this paper considers both the determinants and consequences of corporate governance and likely links between them, and also considers internal corporate governance mechanisms and the measures that are used as their proxies. In combining these three aspects of corporate governance and showing potential links, the framework offers insights into future research opportunities. The framework can be adapted to any country or organisational setting and also offers the opportunity to consider theories other than agency theory when studying corporate governance disclosures.

Research Summary: Using a principal-principal agency theory lens, we examine corporate governance and compensation design in family-owned businesses. We conceptualize how CEO pay and pay-performance sensitivity is influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 support our argument that family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs of superior-performing firms have higher pay-performance sensitivity compared to professional CEOs of other superior-performing firms. Our findings reveal nuanced heterogeneity in nepotism in emerging economy family firms--CEO compensation is a mechanism for some controlling families to tunnel corporate resources. Managerial Summary: We examine whether CEO compensation and its responsiveness to realized firm performance in Indian family firms in influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 suggests family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs' high compensation is unaffected by poor firm performance and is disproportionately boosted by superior firm performance. These results suggest that poor corporate governance allows some family controlled Indian firms to use CEO compensation as a mechanism to tunnel corporate resources in ways that hurt minority shareholders.

Agency theory predicts that institutional ownership plays an important role in monitoring corporate risk-taking. This study examines this ownership-risk taking linkage in Japan over the period 2007 and 2019. We proxy risk through measures of idiosyncratic risk, total risk, and market beta. We show that (relational) foreign institutional shareholdings (do not) induce corporate risk-taking, thereby mitigating (preserving) the managerial 'quiet life' in Japanese corporations. Using 2SLS analysis, the roles of institutional shareholders are robust to endogeneity concerns. Finally, we also confirm robustness using alternative accounting-based risk proxies such as the standard deviation of Tobin's Q and ROA. Our study implies that the monitoring of institutional shareholders is important in Japanese corporations whose top executives might be prone to seek a 'quiet life'.

Research shows that electronic monitoring technologies can reduce illicit agent (e.g., frontline worker) behavior along monitored dimensions such that principals (e.g., firms) benefit. Drawing on theory from criminology regarding the concept of offense displacement, we explain why the benefits from increased monitoring may be mitigated if agents subsequently increase other types of illicit acts not subject to greater monitoring. We investigate this possibility by examining how a mandate requiring millions of truck drivers to adopt electronic logging devices to record their working hours affected different safety behaviors and outcomes. Using data from millions of driver inspections and crash counts before and after the mandate and a differences-in-differences identification strategy, we find greater monitoring due to the mandate achieved its first-order effect of reducing the frequency that drivers were in non-compliance with work hour rules (the monitored dimension). However, drivers for small firms that were most affected by the mandate also appear to have increased their frequency of unsafe driving (e.g., speeding). We also find that crash counts for small firms did not fall relative to large firms, and may have increased. These results call into question whether increased electronic monitoring has improved safety in this industry. (c) 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.

This study investigates specifically the effects of institutional settings and risks on dividend payout policy for banks operate in an emerging market of Nigeria. The present study measures the risk by using financial, business, credit, and default risk at the bank-level and financial, economic, and political risk at the country level. To achieve the objective of this study, panel data random-effects Tobit estimation methodology is employed from the period 2007-2016. Findings reveal that the weak institutional settings lead Nigerian banks to pay out fewer dividends and set their payouts corresponding to the substitution agency model of dividends. Also, results show that Nigerian banks typically pay out more dividends in cases of growth opportunity as a substitute mechanism for mitigating agency problems and for establishing a good reputation. However, by strengthening the levels of investor protection, Nigerian bank managers prefer a low payout policy and are less probable to use dividend policies as a substitute mechanism. Moreover, except for the positive effect of default risk, findings show that the risks at the bank-level, in particular, business risk, and at the country level, particularly financial and economic risks, have a significant negative effect on dividend payouts. Results are robust to alternative estimation procedures and also document that global risk has a statistically significant negative impact on Nigerian banks' dividend payouts policy.

Infusing stakeholder agency theory with insights from behavioural agency theory, we describe a frame-dependent relationship between CEO stock option incentives and tax avoidance. Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm's effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms - an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO's ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of family involvement on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-firm performance (FP) relationship in the US hospitality industry. Building on agency theory, this study examines how family ownership, management and board control influence the relationship between CSR and FP. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the moderating effect of family ownership, family management and family board control, this study adopts the two-way fixed-effects model and performs a panel regression analysis with robust standard errors. The sample period spans 1994-2018 and 565 firm-year observations are included. Findings: This study finds that the impact of CSR on FP is positively moderated by the extent of a firm's family member involvement. In specific, all three aspects of corporate governance (i.e. ownership, management and board control) positively moderate the relationship between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study yield several recommendations for hospitality managers, including shaping strategic decisions for implementing CSR, by providing a unique perspective that the involvement of founding family members can be helpful in enhancing firm value through CSR activities. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the further understanding of the CSR-FP link in the hospitality literature. In addition, this study provides practical guidelines for hospitality firms in the context of CSR by revealing possible advantages of strengthened founding family involvement.

Multi-family firms represent an important and complex type of family firm that is not as well understood as single-family firms. We develop a governance-based framework of the agency complexities in multi-family firms, theorizing that divergent family-centered noneconomic goals between the owning families create complex inter-family agency problems that are intensified by evolving family dynamics. We propose governance mechanisms that address these problems by limiting opportunistic behavior associated with the pursuit of noneconomic goals related to firm control, family altruism, social capital, and transgenerational succession. We then present a future research agenda that can expand our knowledge of multi-family firms. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between hard, negative corporate social responsibility (CSR) information disclosure and corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a generalised least squares panel data analysis based on a sample of firms ranked in the Fortune Global 500 for the period 2013-2016. Robustness check tests were conducted to limit endogeneity concerns. Findings: The results show that in line with strategic legitimacy theory, agency theory and organisational stigma theory, poor sustainability performers disclose a low quality of hard, negative CSR information. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for stakeholders to identify good and poor CSR performers by better understanding whether corporate CSR reports are more likely to be symbolic or substantive when considering the amount of hard, negative content in their CSR stand-alone reports. Social implications: The research highlights the opportunistic behaviour of CSR reporting, which is used more as a legitimation device than as an accountability mechanism. Thi Originality/value: Although numerous studies have investigated the association between the level of corporate social disclosure (CSD) and corporate social performance, no research has focussed on hard, negative CSD. Also, an index that captures the disclosure quality rather than the quantity of negative CSR information was constructed. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although the business strategies of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are investigated theoretically and practically, their diffusion and features in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are not clearly described in the literature. This is in particular due to the recent transformation that member countries have been going through since the financial crisis of 2008 and the Arab Spring. Through shareholder maximization theory, agency theory, and the resource-based view we identified the reasons and characteristics of M&As in the Middle East and North Africa regions. Following a systematic literature review methodology, we identified 37 articles related to M&A in MENA countries published in peer-reviewed journals and reported in CABS ranking (Chartered Association of Business Schools). Based on this analysis, we map the extant literature on the topic and present an integrative framework of these features for future researchers to further explore and expand the boundaries of the domain.

It is timely for Technological Forecasting and Social Change to have a special issue bringing together recent research about corporate governance and financing of under-researched young technological firms. These enterprises tend to have much wealth stored in intangible assets that are seldom easy to measure. With their typical asset base unlike that of established corporations in traditional sectors, their growth is also different, often with a great need for resources, including capital infusions to capture entrepreneurial opportunities at various times. These new entrants in innovative and high-tech markets are characterized by an insatiable appetite for external financing, and the intrusion of new types of external funders has a strong impact on the governance of these ventures. It is therefore essential to have appropriate methods to finance growth; this has major implications for governance as well as finance. Although research underpinning the phenomenon of alternative finance has been gaining ground, this is still a relatively under-researched field. This paper reviews relevant literature and presents an overview and brief synthesis of the contributions in this issue, within the context of literature and lacunae. (c) 2020

Central to economic development is entrepreneurship. Using an agency theory lens, we seek to better understand how national policy can spur entrepreneurship. Guided by capitalist and socialist logic and ideals we investigate the direct and joint effects of market freedom and social spending national policies. In drawing from a sample of 19 countries spanning 2004-2010, we find that neither market freedom nor social spending alone positively impacts entrepreneurial activity; however, an interaction exists, as entrepreneurial activity is bolstered when enhancing market freedom and social spending complement one another. Findings suggest mixed national policies that combine market freedom and social spending are best positioned to spur entrepreneurship. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We use the staggered adoption of the Universal Demand Laws (UD Laws) to examine the effect of an exogenous reduction in shareholders' ability to litigate on the extent of accounting conservatism. On average, we find an increase in reporting conservatism post-UD. The increased conservatism is concentrated in firms that contemplate equity issuance, with a high proportion of monitoring investors, and high corporate governance quality. In contrast, firms with specific short-term incentives for aggressive accounting-such as those narrowly beating benchmarks, those with abnormal insider trading, and those likely to violate debt covenants-weakly governed firms, and firms with high ex ante litigation risk decrease reporting conservatism after UD. Our results suggest that the relation between the litigation environment and reporting conservatism is complex and dependent on specific characteristics and unique circumstances of the firms.

Using a database of 56 studies on corporate governance in the banking industry that were published between 2007 and 2019, this study performs a meta-analytic review to examine the impact of board governance on bank performance. We investigate how board size, CEO duality, outside directors, and female directors on board play a role in determining bank performance. Variations in the relationship between board governance and bank performance that attribute to moderating effects of potential moderators, including the system of corporate governance, bank performance measures, the definitions of governance variables, publication quality, and endogeneity concerns, are also encapsulated. Our study shows that bank performance is positively associated with larger boards and a high proportion of outside and female directors, supporting the resource dependence theory. We find that the moderating variables considerably alter the link between board governance and bank performance. The study offers ways to enhance board effectiveness by enforcing governance practices in the banking systems based on each countries' legal and institutional framework and suggests reconsidering mandates for smaller boards and duality on boards of banking firms.

Corruption has emerged as a well-debated subject against the backdrop of electronic government (e-government). While e-government has attained a level of sophistication in leading countries, there are countries for which going digital remains comparatively new on their national schedules. Their struggle and lag in reaching maturity in e-government can be attributed to corruption, which is an infamous issue prevalent across the globe and argued to impede technological innovation. Despite such a possibility, there is a paucity of research examining the "corruption-e-government" linkage. This study, hence, adopts the institutional perspective for conceptualizing corruption and seeks to understand the relationship of corruption in basic national institutions and national stakeholder service systems with e-government maturity. Specifically, by grounding the discussion on the agency theory, the rent-seeking theory, and the perspective of institutions as structures of cooperation and power, this study analyses the moderating influence of corruption in a national stakeholder service system (i.e., business systems) on the relationship of corruption in three basic national institutions (i.e., political, legal, and media) with e-government maturity in a country. The hypothesized relationships are empirically validated using a panel data of 94 countries, and the findings confirm that political corruption, legal corruption, and business-systems corruption in a country play vital roles in influencing its e-government maturity. Implications of our results to research and practice are discussed. (c) 2021

We investigate the dividend policies of firms in the United Kingdom to understand whether firms in different markets use dividends as a signaling or disciplining device. The sample consists of 1247 firms from the highly regulated Main Market (MAIN) and relatively unregulated Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for the period 2002-2017. We find that firms in AIM pay lower dividends than their MAIN counterparts. However, during turbulence, AIM firms decrease dividends lower than MAIN firms. In line with the signaling hypothesis, AIM firms with increased profitability are more likely to increase dividends. These results suggest that AIM firms depend more on the signaling feature of the dividends, whereas MAIN firms use dividends as a disciplining device to limit managerial discretion. Specifically, we find that AIM firms facing bigger agency problems pay lower dividends compared to other AIM firms, in line with the outcome view of agency theory. (c) 2020 The Authors

The paper investigates the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on firm performance from a sample of 155 listed French companies on SBF 120, over 2009-2018. Findings suggest that an increase in CEO compensation seems to improve the accounting-based firm performance, nevertheless it hurts the firm stock market value. More pronounced results are reported when we control for sector compensation interactions. We argue that attractive compensation may improve the executive services in achieving shareholders' objectives, but investors seem to not appreciate a CEO compensation increase. Based on the agency theory, it might be argued that investors fear possible executive opportunistic behavior encouraging them to enjoy overcompensation. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Our study aims to investigate how information asymmetry and ownership structure affect cost of equity capital. For that purpose, we collected 246 issuers over 4 years for a total of 984 observations. By using panel data processing, we found that the information asymmetry we proxied through Price non-Synchronization and trading volume had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Our results also confirmed both Agency Theory and Pecking Order Theory. Both theories are in line with the conditions of the stock market in Indonesia. In addition, we found that institutional and foreign ownership structures also had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Furthermore, our results also confirmed Interest Alignment Theory and Entrenchment Theory. Our research is expected to contribute to the debate on the existence of information asymmetry and ownership structures in relation to the cost of equity capital. We also hope that it will be a valuable input for investors in considering their investment. Moreover, from the results of this study, investors can also consider foreign ownership or institutional ownership in determining their investment. In addition, stock market regulators in Indonesia can develop approaches to minimize information asymmetry and encourage foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. (c) 2021 by the authors.

Purpose: The agency theory predicts that there are conflict of interests between managers and shareholders over free cash flow and major operating decisions. Earnings management can help managers hide and retain their private benefits of control. Given that, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether financial leverage reduces agency and information problems caused by earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a sample of annual data of 200 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2002-2016. The data required is obtained from the Rahavard Novin database. The research uses multivariate regression models that regress financial leverage on earnings management proxies and other determinants of capital structure. Findings: The research documents that firms with higher income smoothing and the absolute value of discretionary accruals, as the proxies for earnings management, have higher financial leverage. The results suggest that a higher level of financial leverage can discipline managers and generate useful information about firm quality. Originality/value: The study highlights the informational and disciplining role of debt in the presence of severe uncertainty about firm quality in a developing country.

This study exploits the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws, which place significant obstacles to derivative lawsuits and thus, undermine shareholders' rights by 23 states in the United States (U.S.) from 1989 to 2005 as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of shareholder litigation rights on corporate payout policy. Weakened litigation rights for shareholders materially increase firms' payout ratios. The effect is more pronounced for firms exposed to higher shareholder litigation risk ex-ante, firms with higher institutional holdings, and ones financially unconstrained. Overall, the findings are consistent with lower shareholder litigation threats motivating firms to increase dividend payouts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Research Summary: Venture capital firms (VCs) must simultaneously manage a range of relationships with investors, investees, prospective buyers, and co-investors who frequently exert divergent influences on when investments should be exited. The greater weight of one particular relationship can lead a VC to exit an investment earlier than would maximize returns for that investment. In this study, we utilize a global sample to examine how VC firms' investment duration decisions are shaped by firm-specific and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that VCs are less patient and exit faster when they have less experience, invest in more institutionally challenged host countries, or are foreign and invested in an emerging economy. Importantly, while co-investing with other VCs increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. Managerial Summary: Agency theory explains why firms commonly capitalize on information advantages created by conditions of uncertainty to prioritize their own private interests over those shared with partners. This article introduces a framework, based on multiple agency theory, to examine the factors shaping the duration of venture capital firms' investments. Our findings, based on a sample of deals across 33 countries, suggest greater patience when host country market institutions are more advanced and venture capitalists themselves have more experience. In emerging economies only, we find that patience is increased by being local or from a foreign country with similarly challenging institutions. Importantly, while co-investing with other venture capitalists increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. (c) 2021 Strategic Management Society.

Purpose: In view of current climate change policies, this study aims to provide researchers, regulators, and business practice with the current picture of practices regarding carbon-related compensation granted to chief executive officers (CEO). To this end, it examines whether and to what extent European companies translate their carbon reduction strategies into carbon targets underlying their CEOs' short-term and long-term compensation, what characteristics the carbon targets used commonly have in terms of their quality and time frame, and whether the carbon targets used differ among carbon-intensive, and less carbon-intensive companies. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective, this study explores the patterns of use and characteristics of carbon-related targets in CEO compensation. In this vein, a content analysis of corporate disclosure for the business years 2018 and 2019 is conducted for a European sample of 65 large listed companies from 16 countries and 11 industries. Findings: The findings of this study show that albeit the trend toward new adoption, carbon-related CEO compensation systems are still uncommon. The results also reveal that carbon targets are mainly used to determine short-term compensation. Further, the findings highlight that carbon-related CEO compensation is almost equally widespread among carbon-intensive and less carbon-intensive companies. However, in terms of target quality, the study shows that carbon-intensive companies display greater heterogeneity and opacity. Originality/value: By analyzing the characteristics of carbon targets and the prevalence of carbon-related CEO compensation for the first time, this study contributes to the stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective on corporate governance. In view of the European Green Deal and climate-related stakeholder demands, regulators and business practice are encouraged to recognize that carbon-related CEO compensation should gain momentum and the disclosure on this matter should become more transparent and comparable among companies and across industries.

Agency theory suggests that entrenched managers are less likely to pay dividends. However, according to the catering theory, external pressures from investors can force managers to increase dividend payments. Hence, we test whether entrenched managers respond to investor demand for dividends and share repurchases. Using a large sample of 9677 US firms over the period 1990-2016 (i.e. a total of 80,478 firm-year observations), we test and find evidence that managerial entrenchment negatively impacts dividend payments. Our findings suggest that catering effects weaken the negative impact of managerial entrenchment on payout policy and that in firms with entrenched managers an increase in the propensity to pay dividends is conspicuous only when there is external investor demand for dividends. Our results indicate that while insiders and institutional owners might not necessarily favour dividend payments, firms respond to catering incentives when dominated by insiders but not institutional owners. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that dividend payments are a result of external pressures to reduce agency problems associated with firms run by entrenched managers.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of managerial ownership on carbon transparency. Agency theory suggests that there is conflict of interest between managers and shareholders, and managers tend to take advantage of information asymmetry to entrench their interest. Further, extant literature indicates that management entrenchment incentives is linked with managerial ownership. Draw on agency theory and the insight from prior studies, we argue and predict that corporate carbon transparency is associated with management entrenchment incentives. We measure management entrenchment using managerial ownership and find a positive association between managerial ownership and carbon transparency in the low (0%-10 %) and high (beyond 30 %) regions of convergence-of-interest. However, this relationship becomes negative when ownership is in the entrenchment region (10%-30 %). The findings suggest that managers with ownership in the regions of convergence-of-interest are inclined to be open and apply a proactive strategy, whereas entrenched managers are likely to be opaque, so become insensitive to call for climate stabilisation and carbon transparency.

Motivated by growing attention to the agency problems of institutional investors, along with recent changes that have identified real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a separate industry segment, this study investigates the impacts of institutional ownership on the firm value of hotel REITs. Hotel REITs provide unique regulatory and operational settings in which it is appropriate to investigate the potential adverse consequences of institutional investments on firm value. This study performs additional analyses using non-REIT hotel corporations (hotel C-corporations) for comparison. After testing pooled ordinary least squares, fixed and random effects, and two-stage least squares in quadratic models, the results of the random effects models are found to be valid and are thus adopted to examine the hypothesized relationship. The analysis showed a U-shaped relationship between institutional ownership and firm value (as measured using Tobin's q) but a dominantly negative relationship in the majority of observations, whereas no significant relationship is found for hotel C-corporations.

Using the first ever Newsweek "Green Rankings" of the 500 largest U. S. firms in 2009 as a significant historical event, we test for the stockholder reaction to ratings of corporate environmental performance. Both the conventional null hypothesis significance testing and Bayesian approaches show that stockholders react significantly more positively to corporations with higher ratings of corporate environmental performance and that this effect is stronger in family owned firms. Our findings suggest that majority shareholders do not necessarily appropriate minority stockholders' rents when investing in environmental activities, as would be the case in the presence of "Type II" agency conflicts between majority family owners and minority stockholders. The family ownership effect is also found to be stronger in dirty (heavy polluting) industries as well as in more competitive and more opaque industry contexts.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Purpose: In the wake of certain corporate scandals, many stakeholders are questioning if current high levels of executive remuneration, world-wide, are in fact related to company performance. After the implementation of King III in 2010, there has been an expectation that governance has improved in South African companies. If so, empirical testing should find executive remuneration to be positively related to forms of performance that reflect an increase in company value, like Tobin's Q, or return on assets, rather than measures such as total revenue. Design/methodology/approach: Agency theory predicts that if executive remuneration is not carefully designed to maximise the value of the company, executive directors will tend to maximise revenue instead. To test this prediction, hand-collected panel data from Johannesburg Stock Exchange company reports are linked to company performance data to test this prediction, across the years 2010-2017, post King III. Findings: Results challenge certain important assumptions. Generalised method of moments tests find total revenue, rather than value added measures of performance such as Tobin's Q or return on assets, to predict executive director remuneration. This is notwithstanding the significance of Tobin's Q in testing based on ordinary least squares. Implications of these findings for the field are derived and discussed. Originality/value: Unique findings suggest that complacency about the relationships between executive director compensation and company performance is unwarranted. In light of a decline in the country's international rankings on the quality of its corporate governance, a renewed focus on the effectiveness of human resource compensation strategy may be necessary in this context.

Although innovation can be a critical source of competitive advantage, research has found that debt can erode management's willingness to invest in R&D. In this article, we employ a stakeholder bargaining power perspective to argue that this effect is most pronounced when the firm's bonds are concentrated in the hands of bond blockholders. Furthermore, we contend that the temporal orientation of bondholders influences this relationship. Specifically, while it is commonly assumed that bondholders have a limited temporal orientation that induces them to focus on short-term value appropriation, we argue that some bond blockholders adopt a long-term temporal orientation. This orientation, in turn, makes them more inclined to support long-term value creation for the firm in the form of enhanced investments in R&D. Moreover, while agency theory suggests that there is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, our results suggest that the temporal orientation of investors (i.e., both shareholders and bondholders) matters much more than whether they invested in the firm's equity or its debt.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the link between national culture and investment efficiency through a cross-country study. Based on a sample of 3,216 firms operating in 23 countries and observed over the 2009-2018 period, the study uses national culture Hofstede dimensions and overinvestment as operationalised in Biddle et al. (2009) model. To this end, a logit model and a GMM regression are applied. The results indicate that individualism and masculinity dimensions reinforce the likelihood that managers overinvest and tend to increase overinvestment levels since people from these cultures are known by their individual and money-oriented aspirations. However, managers from power distance cultures and high uncertainty avoidance engage less in overinvestment. This study provides additional cross-country factors that explain overinvestment not determined by agency theory. Manager's investment decisions are not only perceived through an objective financial perspective but also through beliefs and perceptions which are inherited from a manager's culture.

We investigate the unexplored role of large controlling shareholders (blockholders) in constraining real earnings management (REM). We examine the mechanisms through which blockholders engage with the managers to manipulate corporate earnings. We also investigate the extent to which country-level institutional and regulatory arrangements influence the blockholders ability to mitigate REM. We show that powerful family blockholders develop a coalition to manipulate the board strategic decision making in their favour which leads to a higher level of REM. Our evidence shows that the higher quality institutional and regulatory arrangements endogenously determine the better corporate financial reporting which effectively mitigates the REM. (c) 2021

Auditors of foreign cross-listed firms face liability arising from the nature of the institutional monitoring framework of legal claims that can potentially be brought against the auditor in both the home country and the US. This paper is the first to document the relationship between auditor liability and auditor pricing of excess cash holdings for foreign firms cross-listed in the US. Our findings indicate that auditors demand a fee premium for foreign incorporated clients with greater excess cash holdings, consistent with auditors recognizing the potential for legal exposure to agency conflict arising from foreign listed US traded clients. Furthermore, we examine aspects of foreign capital market protections, such as disclosure requirements, the strength of legal enforcement, and the strength of shareholder rights to better understand auditor perception of the liability they incur due to the agency costs associated with excess cash holdings. We find that there is a significant positive association between audit fees and excess cash holdings for firms where the country of incorporation permits greater liability of auditors in criminal and civil litigation. In addition, auditors assign higher audit fees to firms holding greater excess cash incorporated in countries with greater required accounting disclosure, stronger legal enforcement and stronger shareholder rights.

Using the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws in the United States, we show that the reduction in shareholder litigation risk deteriorates firms' stock price informativeness. This reduction in stock price informativeness is due to firms changing the way they invest rather than obfuscating or withholding firm-specific information. We also show that the reduction in litigation risk is associated with higher investment-price sensitivity. Overall, despite causing a deterioration in firms' information environment, the reduction in litigation risk does not appear to harm shareholder wealth. Our paper offers novel insights into the net economic benefits of shareholder litigation laws. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether corporate governance has a mediating or moderating effect on the relationship between capital structure and firm performance. This study employs a quantitative method with a sample of 224 Italian non-financial listed firms from 2013-2017. Collected data were analysed using OLS and GMM estimations to test the research hypotheses and to assess the mediating and/or moderating effect of corporate governance. Based on an integrated theoretical framework that draws insights from agency theory, pecking order theory, and trade-off theory, our results are threefold. First, we find that capital structure has a negative and significant impact on firm performance. Second, we show a significant association between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. Specifically, we find that board size has a negative effect on firm performance, while board independence and managerial ownership has a positive effect on firm performance. Finally, our results indicate that corporate governance mechanisms do not mediate, but instead moderate the association between capital structure and firm performance. This study further suggests some important policy implications for both theory and practice. (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The extant academic literature has shown the distinct differences between Islamic and conventional financial institutions along either a performance or efficiency front with an attribution to these differences to the adoption of a religio-financial framework merging the principles of economics and finance with those of Shariah. However, these empirical estimations do not entirely capture the religio-financial framework since they use performance and efficiency measures that include both conventional and Shariah transactions. We address this gap in the literature by examining the dynamics influencing the holding behavior of Shariah assets by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Given that the a priori hypothecation of Shariah asset holding behavior is relatively nebulous, we draw extensively from the traditional macroeconomic and managerialist literature in building our econometric model. By exploiting a unique and proprietary dataset comprising 140 Islamic financial institutions operating in 16 different countries over the time period 2011-2015, we find that economic wealth, market liquidity and the institutional board size are robust and positive linear predictors of IFI Shariah assets' holding behavior, thus providing support for the traditional macroeconomic theory of asset demand and firm-based agency theory.

Since the early 2000s, Sino-foreign equity joint ventures (JVs) have declined sharply as a predominant strategy for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enter and operate in China. We study one of the contributory factors, foreign buyout, and its performance implications. By applying incomplete contract theory and an agency perspective, we provide micro evidence that superior post buyout performance is observed in converted wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOSs) with efficiency-seeking operations and subsequent CEO succession. The findings extend our understanding that ownership per se does not guarantee performance improvement. Instead, it is the alignment between ownership and the owner's inputs, and between ownership and the owner's managerial control, that give rise to performance improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The topic of corporate cash holdings ha received relatively little attention from academic researchers. However, this decision has always been at the center of interest of any company seeking to improve its performance. This article aims to examine the relationship between agency costs related to managerial discretion and cash holdings by Moroccan companies. In order to do this, we will mobilize both agency theory and free cash flow theory. To date, and to our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the cash flow of Moroccan companies in the light of agency theory. This study contributes to cash holdings research in Morocco by exploring the reasons for holding cash through a sample of Moroccan non-financial companies that are listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange for a period of 12 years (from 2007 to 2018). This research uses econometric models based on a positivist approach with a hypothetical-deductive method. Our results show that there is a strong positive relationship between cash holdings and cash flow. It also turns out that the liquidity of these companies is significantly negatively affected by the debt leverage and the growth opportunities of the company.

Our study aims to investigate the impact of some governance mechanisms especially, shareholder activism, gender diversity, board independence, and board size, on investment efficiency as measured by capital expenditure (CAPEX). So, we conducted an empirical study on 626 Asian listed companies (China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and India) during the period2012-2019. To test our hypotheses, we used panel data estimation and constructed estimates using three estimation methods: GLS, NEWEY-WEST, and WLS regressions. To strengthen our results, we established a robustness test by choosing a new measure for our dependent variable: the growth rate of Property, plant, and equipment (Growth PP&E). The results of our study highlight that shareholder activism, gender diversity, and duality impact negatively and significantly the level of investment efficiency, while debt and board size have positive impact on the dependent variable. The robustness check confirmed these results. (c) 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Drawing on stakeholder and agency theories, we examine how employee friendly practices impact dividend payments in emerging countries. Using data from 862 firms and 6,071 firm-year observations from 17 emerging countries, we find that the employee friendly practices are negatively related to the dividend payments. This relationship is found to be stronger for government owned firms. We further examine the 'agency problems' and 'future investment' as possible channels through which employee friendly practices may lead firms to pay low dividends. We find the support for the future investment channel. Lastly, we examine the value effect of employee friendly treatment and find that employee friendly practices increase firm performance in emerging markets which lends support to the effectiveness of the investment channel.

In this paper we predict and find that the lobbying activities of firms can complement executive networks in determining executive compensation. Firms of all sizes, after considering market competition as a governance mechanism, prefer to consider lobbying as a means of networking along with executive level networking to determine executive compensation. The empirical implication of the study provides guidance to scholars who should consider lobbying along with executive networks in determining executive compensation. The composite theoretical underpinning and the importance of information flow through lobbying activities of firms will be an important insight for policy makers involved in determining executive compensation.

We examine the extent to which outsider chief executive officers (CEOs) influence corporate financial leverage policies. We define an outsider CEO as one who appears in the reporting year and became CEO either immediately upon joining or within 3 months of joining a firm. There are arguments in the literature that the selection of an outsider CEO can either increase or decrease financial leverage. We investigate this issue using 11,118 Australian firm-year observations from 1216 firms listed during the period 2001-2015. Our findings suggest that, in the short-term after their appointment, outsider CEOs reduce firm dependence on debt. This result is robust to several additional tests and four measures to minimize endogeneity concerns. However, with an increase in their tenure at the firm, outsider CEOs revert to greater dependency on corporate debt. After supplementary analyses, we determine that the outsider CEOs short-term strategy of reducing financial leverage involves using cash reserves and restricting dividends to reduce existing debt. Instead, outsider CEOs finance capital expenditure projects thus providing a positive signal to the market that such CEOs are more creditworthy. Our results also suggest that outsider CEOs exercise more control over financial leverage when they have specialist attributes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine how the political effectiveness and board independence moderate the effect of managerial entrenchment on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data of non-financial firms from the BRICS countries for the period of 2010-2018 were obtained from Thomson Reuters (asset 4) and financial reports. Panel regression model was employed to analyse the data. Research findings: The results show that there is a positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Political embeddedness was found to strengthen the positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Independent directors was reported to weaken the relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on agency theory. The finding provides novel insights into how managerial entrenchment affects CSR activities. It also expands the body of knowledge on corporate governance and CSR by focusing on manager's self-interest to shareholder's interest. Practitioner/Policy implication: Practically, this study provides valuable information to stakeholders, regulatory authorities and investors who wish to assess various antecedents of CSR. Research limitation/Implications: Future study should consider comparing the developed and developing countries. Other aspects of CSR should also be considered for better understanding. This study sheds light on the relevance of promoting the social and environmental awareness mechanisms surrounding companies in addition to developing CSR policies focused on corporations of BRICS countries.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

In this article, the authors analyse the audit fees of a large sample of English local SOEs from 2009-2017, assessing the impact of board composition and ownership structure on those fees. SOEs with more politicians on their boards of directors had higher audit costs and this was especially so for majority-owned SOEs.

This article investigates the relationship between political control and audit fees for local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in England--hybrid public service organizations not subject to public sector audit. Panel regression techniques are used to analyse secondary data on 405 SOEs for 2009-2017 where major local authorities held an interest. Statistical results suggest greater political representation on boards of directors of local SOEs is associated with higher audit fees and positive relationship between political control and audit fees is stronger for majority public ownership.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the link between agency costs mitigation via three levels of rights protection (minority rights protection, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency issues) provides the propitious climate for financing investment opportunities around the world. Design/methodology/approach: We use Bartlett's three-group method to stratify countries based on how well they protect investors as measured by the scores provided in the Doing Business dataset developed by the world bank for 189 countries. We then test a variety of independent hypotheses that the alleviation of agency costs via three levels of protection (minority investors' rights, contract enforcement, resolving insolvency issues) is associated with better access to credit via the banking system, better valuation of listed firms via the stock market and higher investment and growth. Findings: Our findings support Agency Theory which explains why the absence of legal protection of external investors leads to stock markets and financial institutions failing to fulfill their role of financing the economy. Practical implications: The policy implication from this study indicates that countries ought to (1) develop legislation that protects investors' rights, (2) improve the quality of their judicial system in terms of enforcing the legislation and (3) build the framework for resolving disputes during insolvency as these are important ingredients for a developed financial system. Originality/value: We use the World bank dataset and a new methodology to quantify the significance of the relationship between minority rights protection, ineffective enforcement, lack of bankruptcy laws and access to firm financing via the banking sector and the stock market. It provides new evidence that the quality of the judicial system in a country matter for firms' ability to raise financing and enhance value creation. (c) 2021, Mejda Bahlous-Boldi.

The current study examines the effect of ownership structure (i.e., government ownership, family ownership, and foreign ownership) on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, by considering Jordan as a case study. By using a sample of 136 non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over the period of 2015-2019, we find that family ownership has a positive and significant impact on CEO compensation. The finding regarding foreign ownership is contrary to expectations, with a higher foreign ownership reflecting a higher CEO compensation. Overall, these results imply that the ownership structure of Jordanian companies exerts a significant influence on the CEO pay setting process. However, government ownership has no relationship with CEO compensation. This indicates that government ownership is ineffective in determining CEO compensation. We further find that firm size is positively related to CEO compensation, indicating that larger companies have more ability to generate high internal funding, and can afford to pay higher compensation to quality managerial talent. In contrast, the effects of firm age and liquidity are not at significant levels. (c) 2021 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

Determining cash holdings is amongst the most important financial decisions made by heads of corporations. This decision relies on theoretical convictions and views as well as firm specific characteristics. This article analyzes the determinants of cash management in Moroccan corporations. By mobilizing all the theories of optimal financial structure, our research attempts to focus on the field of knowledge in the financial management of cash surpluses. No analysis has been carried out concerning cash and cash equivalents in Moroccan firms. These results could, therefore, contextualize the existing knowledge in this research theme and better understand the behavior of companies and their main trends in terms of cash flow, as well as the objectives and motivations of managers. The sample studied consists of 42 Moroccan companies, which are all publicly traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange over 13 years (2007-2019). This research uses an empirical econometric study based on a positivist approach with a hypothetical-deductive method. We use panel regression analysis and perform all the necessary tests to determine the exact nature of this dataset. Our results show some evidence that a strong positive correlation exists between liquidity level and cash-flow as well as family shareholding. It is also found that the cash holdings of these companies are significantly negatively affected by how large or small the firm is, working capital requirement, debt leverage, as well as growth opportunity of the firm.

Background: Sticky SG&A costs provide a novel opportunity to investigate whether payout policy serves as a remedy for management overspending on perquisites that are embedded in SG&A expenses. Payout policy, especially under strong governance, may reduce overspending. Another possibility is that management may use sales declines opportunistically to repurchase shares when sales are expected to rebound. Methods: Regression analysis is used to examine the effect of payout mechanisms (dividends, share repurchases, and combinations thereof) and shareholder rights (EIndex) to determine whether managerial overspending on perquisites is reduced through payout policy. Results: The results indicate that dividends and share repurchases are associated with reduced SG&A cost stickiness. Payout policy reduces sticky SG&A costs under both strong and weak governance, where dividend payout is significant only for firms with strong governance, and share repurchases primarily significant for firms with weak governance. Conclusion: Under strong governance, dividends are significantly associated with reduced SG&A cost stickiness, supporting agency theory. However, strongly governed dividend payers are only significant when they also repurchase shares. For the weak governance sample, dividends are not significant, but share repurchase is significantly associated with less sticky SG&A costs, consistent with weakly governed management repurchasing shares in times of lower sales to improve earnings per share, reduce SG&A expenses to improve net income, and fund the share repurchases.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between financial structure towards the financial performance of companies listed on Amman stock exchange (ASE) as one of the emerging economies. This paper adopted a panel data set of 88 non-financial companies listed on the ASE over a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. According to empirical results that there is significant evidence to support the fact that debt repaying ability (DRAB), managerial ownership (MANOW), and foreign ownership (FOROW) are positively related to firm performance. Otherwise, the findings revealed no evidence to support the impact of the financial structure ability (FSA) towards firm performance. Moreover, the findings support the fact that firm size (SIZ) has a positive impact on firm performance of companies listed on the ASE. On the other hand, (AGE) has a negative impact on firm performance, while (GROWTH) has no impact on firm performance. The current study encourages managers to maintain a good percentage of debt repaying ability and owners to grant shares as managers' incentives, and also to attract foreign investors. Future studies, should try applying the current study on the financial sector. (c) 2021, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.

Using an agency theory framework, we investigate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking behavior. We integrate the incentive alignment and monitoring approaches to reducing principal-agent conflicts by considering them simultaneously. We develop and test hypotheses that suggest that aspects of the governance system of a firm moderate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Results based on data collected from 204 Fortune 1000 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Further, moderating effects were found for CEO duality, blockholder ownership, institutional ownership, and insider ownership. However, empirical analyses fail to provide adequate evidence to support the expected moderating effect of board independence. (c) 2021

This book analytically reviews the impact of the global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) framework on the compliance trajectory of a number of jurisdictions to this framework. The work begins by examining the international financial sector reform and its evolution to inculcate the global framework for AML/CFT regulations. It challenges the resulting uniform AML/CFT due to its paradoxical impact on the compliance trajectory of African countries and emerging economies (ACs/EEs). This is done through an examination of the pre-conditions for effective regulation and compliance drivers for ACs/EEs that reveals the behavioural impact of the AML/CFT standards on the bloc of countries. Through the application of agency theory, it explores the relationship between ACs/EEs on the one hand and the international financial institutions that formulate, disseminate and facilitate compliance with the global framework for AML/CFT standards on the other. The remaining chapters review empirically the compliance pressures and resulting compliance trajectory of ACs/EEs with the AML/CFT standards. The final part of the book provides a detailed explanation of the compliance challenges of ACs/EEs and the legitimacy concerns that facilitate this. This book offers a new direction on the impact of global AML/CFT standards on ACs/EEs and contributes to the understanding of the conditions under which the global standards are likely to facilitate proactive compliance within these blocs of countries. As such it will be a valuable resource for academics, researchers and policy-makers working in this area. (c) 2021 Nkechikwu Valerie Azinge-Egbiri. All rights reserved.

This study attempts to examine the role of managers in the associated agency theory on dividend policy decisions for firms that do not skip dividend payments. This research sample considered the firms that are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and pay regular dividends on an annual basis from the financial year 2011 to 2020. Panel data econometric tools and robustness tests were carried out for model validation. The study results show that there is a higher positive relationship between change in payout ratio and managerial remuneration. Similarly, there is a large positive significance to increase manager incentive for regular payer firms with greater promoter control in higher dividend payout. Thus, this brings an agency theory perspective of rewarding well to managers to increase promoter wealth. Hence, policymakers can contemplate these findings to analyze the nexus between managers and promoters in the dividend policy of firms that never skip their dividend payments.

International diversification and its effect on the firm remains a key theme in business literature. Yet how international diversification-firm performance (IDP) relationship is influenced by firms' ownership has not been adequately examined. This represents an important gap in the literature as owners differ significantly in motivations, capabilities, and governing styles. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, agency theory, and institutional perspective, this study examines how ownership type impacts IDP relationship of a sample of 1074 publicly-listed Indian firms. Results suggest that family- and domestic corporate ownership positively moderates IDP relationship but foreign corporate ownership results in negative moderation. Results further suggest that domestic- and foreign financial institutional ownership imparts no statistically significant influence on IDP relationship. These findings are new to the literature. In conclusion, we discuss our study's implications and limitations and provide directions for future research. (c) Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Marco Corradi and Genevieve Helleringer study the duty of loyalty - encompassing both rules that govern self-dealing and corporate opportunity transactions - from a comparative perspective. We compare the evolution of these two sets of rules in several European jurisdictions and in US Delaware law. The chapter begins by comparing the approach to regulating self-dealing and related party transactions under both common law (namely the US and UK) and civil law regimes (focusing on continental Europe). It then turns to the legal development of corporate opportunity rules, and contrasts the approach to corporate opportunities under US law to the less-developed jurisprudence on corporate opportunities in civil law jurisdictions. We note tensions between the evolution of the law governing self-dealing transactions at the European level, and the lack of harmonization on rules addressing corporate opportunities and continuing divergences in corporate opportunities doctrine across EU jurisdictions. We observe a relaxation of the duty of loyalty in US Delaware law, while there is an asymmetric evolution of its two components, self-dealing and corporate opportunities, in the European context. On the one hand, self-dealing rules have existed in European corporate laws for a long time and have been substantially relaxed in Europe in recent times as they have in the US. On the other hand, corporate opportunities rules have been introduced in most European jurisdictions only throughout the last two decades - without an express possibility of a waiver such as the one granted by DGCL s. 122(17). The convergence of self-dealing rules may have been facilitated by the harmonization of EU financial market law, which in turn has not affected corporate opportunities rules. Economic agency theory provides a rationale for a hypothetical convergence of self-dealing and corporate opportunities rules, based on their economic function.

This paper examines the impact of family ownership, management, and generations on IPO underpricing and the long-run performance of publicly listed firms in Indonesia from 2004 to 2015. This study is based on agency theory, which discusses the relationship between shareholders and management, as well as controlling and non-controlling shareholders. Study results show that IPO underpricing was 28% higher for family firms than non-family firms. Among family firms, a family member's presence as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) significantly reduced the level of IPO underpricing. A negative relationship between family CEO and IPO underpricing was only observed if a CEO at the time of IPO was the founder instead of family descendants. A long-run return of family-firm IPOs was more likely to underperform their non-family-firm counterparts. The findings in the primary market suggest that investors predict bigger issues of agency conflicts between controlling and non-controlling shareholders in family firms than the issues of agency conflicts between shareholders and management in non-family firms. Since investors consider family-firm IPOs to be riskier than non-family firms, they demand a higher level of IPO underpricing to compensate for such risks. The results in the secondary market confirm the findings in the primary market. (c) Lukas Setia-Atmaja, Yane Chandera, 2021.

How multinational enterprises (MNEs) coordinate and control their geographically dispersed subunits is central to international management research (Kostova, Nell, & Hoenen, 2018). Our study adopts agency rationales to evaluate the effects of headquarters (HQs)-subsidiary convergence on the performance levels of the latter. Convergence within organizations relies to a large amount on controls that predicate a specific extent of alignment. In theory, the concept of alignment is seen as a valid proxy of agency intensity (Eisenhardt, 1989). Drawing on the supposition that MNEs are differentiated networks, where some subsidiaries continue to function the traditional competence-exploiting role while others are competence-creating and augment the advantages of their home-base (Bjorkman, Barner-Rasmussen, & Li, 2004), alignment challenges can be manifested in six dimensions that define their strategic posture, span the organizational context and underly competitive imperatives: 1) subsidiary strategy, 2) culture, 3) governance practices, 4) financial decisions, 5) human resources, and 6) environmental activity. Drawing on a sample of 72 MNE foreign operations and gathering 254 responses from top management team (TMT) members, our results indicate that strategic, cultural, governance, and HR alignment are important determinants of subsidiary performance. However, whereas strategic, cultural, and governance convergence between HQs and subsidiaries are positively related to increased performance levels, an ethnocentric approach towards HR practices seems to trigger welfare losses.

The most contentious element in debate regarding corporate governance is the association of corporate governance (CG) with firm performance. This research employed the 2SLS regression model on a panel data, collected from 24 Asian multinationals from 2006 to 2015. The firm performance was measured in two ways; accounting measure (ROA and sales growth) and market measure (Tobin's Q). The outcomes demonstrate that quality of corporate governance (QCG) index has a significant association in enhancing the performance of firms in Asian economies. Furthermore, these results also indicate that explicit corporate governance variables such as board independence, audit committee independence, ownership concentration and CEO duality, also have significant association with the performance of companies in Asian countries which is in accordance with the agency theory.

Even though the Board of Commissioners has a significant role in making an optimal international decision, there is a limited empirical finding using data from the Unique Continental corporate governance system, such as Indonesia. This study examines the relationship between the Board of Commissioners diversity and service companies' international decision. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of ethnic, nationality, qualification, and experience diversity of Board of Commissioners on the international decision. A company with a high Board of Commissioners diversity tends to have more effective monitoring the Management Board and therefore reduce the agency cost and the company performance. Ninety-nine service companies listed in Indonesia's stock exchange has participated in this study. As this study using the multivariate regression analysis, the classical assumptions must be satisfied. The result shows that ethnic, qualification and experience diversity have a significant effect on the international decision. Besides, company size tends to have a better position to sell in the foreign market. A company with higher leverage is likely to have a higher international decision. Theoretically, this research implies that board governance diversity in a unique two-tier board model could also be explained by agency theory. This finding also shows that the company can increase the international decision by increasing the Board of Commissioners' qualification and experience diversity. However, the Board of Commissioners ethnic diversity should be reduced to increase the international decision. (c) 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on dividend policy in the listed Turkish firms between 2013 and 2019. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the probability of paying dividends, dividend payout ratio and dividend yield measures. The suitable regression procedures (logit, probit and Tobit models) are used to examine the research hypotheses by focusing on a panel data set drawn from the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 index, excluding financial and utility firms. Findings: The empirical findings indicate that institutional and concentrated ownerships are significant and positively associated with dividend payouts, whereas family ownership does not influence dividend policy. On the other end, board size is positive, while chief executive officer duality is negatively related to dividend policy. Additionally, the female directors and board independence are insignificant in influencing firms to pay high dividends. Research limitations/implications: Future researchers can validate this paper's findings by considering the stock dividends as well. Additionally, future researchers may investigate the relationship between these constructs by extending the sample size of firms listed on BIST or in other emerging markets. Practical implications: This study's findings may serve policymakers, regulators, investors and academic researchers to get valuable guidance from relevant literature. The Turkish firms may improve dividend policy by implementing the regulatory framework introduced by the Capital Markets Law in 2012 for effective monitoring and protecting the minority shareholders' rights. The controlling shareholders may alleviate principal-principal conflicts by ensuring the independence of directors and increasing the number of female directors according to the critical mass of at least 30% of board members. Originality/value: This study contributes to agency theory and signaling theory by considering ownership structure and board attributes among Turkish firms related to dividend payments.

The role of corporate governance in performance of firms has been widely discussed in the extant literature. In contrast to examining direct relationships, this study investigates the mediating role of working capital management within these connections. Employing a large sample of nonfinancial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange from 2009 to 2018, findings suggest that a corporate governance quality index and efficiency of working capital management are positively related to firm performance. Additionally, the results indicate that working capital management partially mediates the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. These findings extend existing literature by offering new empirical and theoretical insights. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While past research on minority acquisitions has ignored how agency conflicts could prevent acquirers from realizing value creation opportunities, this study investigates whether principal-agent and principal-principal conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder hinder acquirers' ability to capture value from acquisitions of non-controlling equity stakes. Using archival data from a global sample of 443 minority acquisitions announced between 2011 and 2019, we found that cumulative abnormal returns are positively associated to minority shareholder protection and negatively associated to the presence of a strong controlling shareholder in the target firm. We also found that acquisitions of small non-controlling equity stakes amplify the negative effect of the strong controlling shareholder, which instead weakens if acquirers purchase large non-controlling equity stakes. This study contributes to the development of our understanding of the conditions that expose acquirers to value losses from minority acquisitions by examining the intricate bundle of agency conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder. In so doing, this study also provides useful insights to business practice. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

We use a sample of French firms over the period 2001-2017 to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and related-party transactions (RPTs). Although some of these transactions are efficient, RPTs are usually perceived negatively by outsiders because of the existence of conflict-of-interest transactions deemed to be value-destroying. Based on agency theory and managerial power theory, we argue that female directors have the ability and motivation to challenge managers' use of RPTs. Consistently with this argument, we find that board gender diversity negatively correlates with the number of reported RPTs. This negative correlation is driven by female directors involved in the board's monitoring duties (female independent directors and members of the audit committee). However, because they are less likely to be able to challenge managers, female inside directors do not affect the occurrence of RPTs. In January 2011, the French regulator enacted a gender quota law resulting in a significant increase in female board representativeness. We find that the marginal effect after enacting the gender quota law on the number of reported RPTs is negative for the proportion of female independent directors and female audit committee members, and positive for female inside directors.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on the executives' team and firm performance by investigating the relationships between executives' compensation, management gender diversity and firm financial performance in growth enterprises market (GEM) listed firms in China. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from 461 companies listed on GEM boards during the period from the year 2016 to 2018. Specifically, executives' compensation and female executives are set as the independent variables, and the proxy selected of corporate performance is Tobin's Q ratio. Findings: The results show that the correlation between corporate performance and executive cash payment is not significant, while executives' equity-based compensation shows a significant positive correlation with firm performance. In addition, the participation of female executives is negatively associated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The results have practical implications for governments, policymakers and regulatory authorities, by indicating the importance of women to corporate success. In particular, the findings of this paper emphasize the specific background of GEM in China and provide empirical support for the value of women's participation in corporate governance. In addition, the finding on the relationship between executive compensation and corporate performance of GEM listed companies provides guidance for the establishment of a performance compensation system of GEM listed companies in China. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence for the current literature of executive team and corporate performance. This is the first paper to adopt triangulation in theories from different disciplines including optimal contractual approach, managerial power approach as new perspectives of agency theory, upper echelons theory, motivational-hygiene theory and women leadership style theory. The results will contribute to provide guidance for enterprises to formulate an efficient compensation system and build a reasonable senior management team structure.

Concentrated ownership implies greater alignment between ownership and control, mitigating the agency problem. However, it may also engender governance challenges such as funds appropriation through related party transactions and the oppression of minority shareholders, especially in the context of weak legal systems. We draw from legal theory (the tradeoff controlling shareholder model and private benefits of control) and from organization theory (socioemotional wealth), to suggest that concentrated ownership can be beneficial in both robust and weak legal systems for different reasons. We advance theory on the effects of controlling shareholders and suggest that the longer-term outlook associated with engaged concentrated ownership can aid the shift of the corporation toward Berle and Means' (1932, p. 355) "third possibility" of corporations serving the interests of not just the stockholders or management but also of society.

Financial statement analysts are concerned about the earnings power of companies, thus reliable information from a quality external audit and financial reporting is important as it will have an effect on the performances of GCC companies. On that note, underpinned by the agency theory, this study examines the effects of financial reporting quality, audit quality, and earnings power on companies' performances of the six Arabian GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates). Company performance is measured using the accounting measures, i.e., return on assets and market-to-book value (ROA, M/B) and the market measures (Tobin's Q, EPS). The data sample of this study covers the period between 2013 and 2017, (pre-covid-19), across 191 companies, using 1337 company-years observations. The study uses EGLS Panel Data Regression analysis. The results of the study indicate that earnings power, audit quality, and financial reporting quality have positive effects on companies' performance. The agency theory confirms that financial reporting quality and audit quality increases the reliability of financial statements and decreases information asymmetry. (c) 2022 The Author

Purpose: The study aimed to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of Egyptian firms listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) between 2014 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach: We relied on agency theory and resource dependence theory to generate testable hypotheses and capture the empirical findings. We regressed various performance measures (Return on Assets; Asset Utilization Ratio, Tobin's Q) regarding governance mechanisms (institutional ownership, managerial ownership, board size, board frequent meetings, the presence of non-executive directors and female directors) while controlling for firm size, leverage, years of listing and market share. The study uses ordinary least square (OLS) and two stages least square (2SLS) regression analysis to address the possible endogenous impact of the firms' ownership structure. Findings: Board gender diversity, the managerial ownership and frequent board meetings positively influence the Egyptian firms' efficiency measured by assets utilization, while the institutional ownership and board size have negative effects. When using Tobin's Q, the managerial ownership shows a negative effect while institutional ownership and board size present positive effects. When using 2SLS regression, findings remained stable whereas non-executive directors showed a significant negative association with assets utilization. Practical implications: Policy makers are recommended to draft policies related to limiting the number of board members, diluting the government's indirect ownership of firms, empowering women in boardrooms and developing the skills needed for non-executive directors. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of very few that address firms' performance after a period of political instability accompanied by a greater role for females in the boardrooms of Egypt.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the moderating role of board gender diversity (BGD) in the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board size, board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) gender, CEO duality and ownership concentration) and firm risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 192 non-financial publicly traded Italian firms over 2014-2018, this study tests the proposed research hypotheses and assess the moderating effect of BGD. Findings: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study finds a significant relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking, which is significantly moderated by BGD. BGD accentuates the negative effect of board size, independent directors, CEO gender and CEO duality on firm systematic risk and attenuates the positive impact of CEO duality on firm unsystematic risk. The results, which are consistent with the risk-reduction effect of BGD, are robust to the use of alternative measures of firm risk-taking. Practical implications: Women's presence on corporate boards plays a critical role in the board's involvement in risk-taking. Hence, investors and stakeholders should consider women on corporate boards as a crucial risk-mitigating factor. Originality/value: This paper contributes to our knowledge on risk management by demonstrating the moderating role of BGD while relating corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

Purpose: In view of the current climate change emergency and the growing importance of the climate-related accountability of companies, this paper aims to advance a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of carbon-related chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the agency-theoretical perspective on executive compensation and existing work in the fields of management, corporate governance, cultural studies, and behavioral science, this paper derives a multilevel framework of the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation. Findings: This paper maps the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation at the societal, organizational, group, and individual levels of analysis. It also provides research propositions on the determinants that can support and challenge the implementation of this instrument of environmental corporate governance. Originality/value: In the past literature, the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation have remained largely unexplored. This paper contributes to the academic discussion on environmental corporate governance by showcasing the role of interlinkages among the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation and the possible countervailing impacts. In view of the complex interdisciplinary nature of climate change impact, this paper encourages businesses practitioners and regulators to intensify their climate change mitigation efforts and delineates the levers at their disposal.

Previous corporate governance research has paid little attention to the role of chief executive officer (CEO) labor markets in controlling CEO behaviors because the CEO labor market has been considered inefficient. With the increasing mobility of top executives across firms, however, the potential of CEO labor markets to serve as an external disciplining force has been growing. In this study, we argue that CEOs will be more pressured to engage in desirable behaviors as the CEO labor market becomes more efficient. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms in high-technology industries in United States from 2011 to 2019, we found that CEOs tend to increase R&D investment as CEO labor market supply increases. We also found that the tendency is greater when external CEO succession is more frequent in the market. Our results demonstrate that CEO labor markets have the potential to function as an effective external governance mechanism. Copyright (c) The Author(s), 2022.

The article analyzes how economic theory usually investigates corruption. It describes the main traditional economic theories dealing with this issue--principal-agent theory (agency theory) and rent-seeking theory--and it emphasizes that both face some problems, especially their neglect of some important factors as to why corruption occurs which prevents them from accurately analyzing this phenomenon and proposing solutions on how to fight against it. The article further discusses whether institutional economics can overcome these problems. We show that it does, but that it needs to more seriously consider the environment in which corruption occurs. Redistribution system theory can serve as a useful aid here because it reveals that the source of corruption is an environment of undesirable redistribution. The article provides the characteristics of this type of redistribution and shows how its reduction also leads to the reduction in corruption. It can be concluded that economic theory should not rely only on traditional approaches to corruption but should at least add institutional economics and redistribution system theory to its methods of corruption analysis.

This paper investigates the role of corporate governance in China's outward foreign direct investment (ODI) using a sample of Chinese public firms over the period 2009-2015. Different from previous studies, which mainly use country-level aggregate data to examine China's ODI behavior, this study utilizes firm-level data to explore the impact of corporate governance on firms' ODI decision making. Building on the integration of agency theory and foreign direct investment theories, the study finds that ownership concentration, share ownership, and executive compensation significantly influence China's ODI flows in both full-sample and sub-sample estimations. The corporate governance has an essential effect on firms' ODI flows in that the firms with better corporate governance are more interested in undertaking ODI projects. The results are robust across different sample periods and in both state-owned and non-state-owned firm sub-groups. The government may design some policies such as friendly tax regulations to stimulate private firms to invest overseas. (c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

This study investigates the determinants of dividend pay-out of listed firms in Pakistan from the year 2011 to 2015. The focus of the study is the life cycle theory of dividends, agency theory and signaling theory. Corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the main determinants used in this study. This study also includes eight corporate governance indicators namely insider ownership, ownership concentration, institutional ownership, board independence, board size, CEO duality, audit committee independence and remuneration committee. It is found that ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the significant determinants of dividend pay-out in Pakistan. It is also found that growth opportunities significantly moderate the impact of ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency, cash flow volatility on the dividend pay-out. This research is among the pioneer studies which examine the impact of firm efficiency on dividend pay-out. Likewise, the study is among the first attempts to incorporate growth opportunities as moderating variable in the relationship between corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility with dividend pay-out. Results show that the management of an efficient firm pays a high dividend to increase its reputation in the market. Furthermore, the negative signaling effect of dividend omission may not exist for efficient firms. It implies that efficient firms at their growth stage may also skip dividends.

This paper uses new and unique bank-level data to investigate whether board governance determines executives' remuneration and if the pay-governance relationship changes across bank ownership groups in India. The findings based on dynamic pay model estimated using two-step system GMM approach reveal that (i) past pay levels hold significant predicting power for the future level of executives' pay, (ii) executive remuneration is significantly responsive to forward-looking market-based profitability measures, and (iii) individual board attributes play a significant role in pay setting in the Indian banking industry. Frequent board meetings and a more significant proportion of female directors on board moderate the executive remuneration packages. The results further infer that the board's monitoring abilities considerably differ across ownership groups, with boards play a more prominent role in private banks, while boards of public sector banks lack adequate autonomy to determine executives' pay. The results validate the "managerial power" approach, suggesting that any weaknesses in governance structure (especially in private banks) may inhibit bank boards from effectively performing their monitoring functions in optimal pay fixation.

Purpose: Capitalizing on a unique measure of takeover susceptibility principally based on the staggered implementation of state laws, this study aims to explore the takeover market's effect on managerial ownership. The market for corporate control, often known as the takeover market, is an important external governance mechanism, whereas managerial ownership is a vital internal governance instrument. Managerial ownership brings into convergence the interests of shareholders and managers. The originality of this study arises from the usage of state-level anti-takeover legislations as a measure which is beyond the control of firms and plausibly exogenous to firm-specific characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to the standard regression analysis, this study also executes a variety of robustness checks to minimize endogeneity, i.e. propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, Lewbel's (2012) heteroscedastic identification and Oster's (2019) testing for coefficient stability. Findings: Based on a large sample of US firms, the results show that more hostile takeover threats bring about significantly lower managerial ownership. The results reinforce the prediction of the substitution hypothesis. The disciplinary function of the takeover market reduces agency conflict to the point where managerial ownership is less necessary as a governance mechanism. Specifically, a rise in takeover susceptibility by one standard deviation diminishes managerial ownership by 7.22%. Originality/value: `To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to shed light on the impact of the takeover market on managerial ownership using a novel measure mainly based on the staggered adoption of state laws, which are plausibly exogenous to individual firms' characteristics. Consequently, unlike prior research, this study is more likely to indicate a causal effect, rather than merely a correlation. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: In this study, the authors explore the effects of politically controlled boards on bank loan performance in both state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) and private sector commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The data consist of 409 bank-year observations from 46 sample SCBs and PCBs of Bangladesh for the period 2008-17. The authors apply ordinary least squares pooled regression with year fixed effect for baseline econometric analyses and generalized method of moments regression for robustness tests after addressing the endogeneity issue. Findings: The regression results reveal that the presence of bank "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors" (PA) have significant positive effects on non-performing loans (NPLs). Similarly, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors without substantial ownership interests" (PAWOI) show positive association with NPLs. In contrast, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors with substantial ownership interests" (PAOI) exhibit an inverse relationship with NPLs. These findings support 'agency conflict' arguments and document that both PA and PAWOI are detrimental to bank loan performance in Bangladesh, while PAOI do not have significant effect on increasing NPLs. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing bank governance literature by providing evidence from an emerging economy perspective, where politically affiliated directors (PADs) exploit their positions for personal and/or political gain at the cost of other stakeholders by taking advantage of relaxed regulatory oversights and investor protections.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relation between promoter ownership (PO) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) expenditure in India, the first country to legally mandate the CSR spending. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies panel regression to examine the impact of PO on actual and excess CSR expenditure because panel regression has lesser multicollinearity problems and has the benefit of controlling for individual or time heterogeneity mostly present in cross-section or time series data. The results are robust to testing the CSR expenditure decision (to engage or not to engage in CSR) by using the binary choice logit model. Findings: Based on the agency theory, this study shows a nonlinear relation between PO and CSR expenditure, which suggests that promoters start extracting private benefits of control at the expense of outside shareholders and engage in lesser CSR expenditure only when their ownership crosses a threshold level of 52% approximately. This study further shows that the nonlinear relation between PO and CSR expenditure is more pronounced for firms that are more prone to agency problems, for business group firms than standalone firms and for firms not following the Companies Act 2013 CSR mandate. Practical implications: The findings shed light at the idea of how promoters' incentive alignment should be proposed and followed to encourage a firm's social investment activities. Originality/value: First, this study argues that the relation between PO and CSR expenditure is nonlinear in nature, by showing that the impact of PO on CSR expenditure is adverse only at higher level of PO. Second, this study's richer data set on CSR expenditure not only allows the authors to analyze the relation for actual CSR spending by the firms but also helps to examine the excess spending made over and above the mandatory spending, as directed by the Companies Act, 2013.

Purpose: There is still an ongoing debate on the value relevance of capital structure and its determinants. Recently the issue has been explored in family firms after being explored in mature firms. This paper investigates the role of institutional investors and the firm's innovation activity in influencing the firm's decision and ability to acquire debt capital. Design/methodology/approach: A large sample of 700 privately-held family firms in Italy from 2010 to 2019. Two analysis techniques are used: panel analysis and path analysis. The value of debt and the debt ratio are used as leverage measures. The value of patent (as a proxy for innovation) and institutional investor are the explanatory variables. Findings: The results show that institutional investors have no relationship with financial leverage measures except when controlling for an interaction variable (Institutional investors x Lombardy region). The patent value is positively correlated with debt; however, the ratio patent-to-asset is negatively related to financial leverage indicating higher risk exposure. The nonlinearity test demonstrates a turning point when the relationship between patent value and debt inverts. Practical implications: Firms should monitor their innovation activity since excessive innovation increases risk exposure and affects financing opportunities and value. The involvement of institutional investors does not always enhance value. Originality/value: Existing literature focuses separately on family firm innovations and financial leverage as outcome variables, emphasizing the role of institutional investors in both fields by adopting agency theory and socioemotional wealth framework. In this study, the authors go further by merging both relationships, investigating the dynamics of the institutional-family firm innovation relationship in influencing the firm's capital structure. The authors contribute to the ongoing debate by providing original findings on capital structure, governance and innovation, supported by rigorous methods to enhance family firms' decision-making.

This article investigates the determinants of dividend policy on the Casablanca stock exchange. The variables tested were based on the main theories of dividend policy, and the fixed effect model was used to test panel data over a period of 16 years from 2003 to 2018. The eight independent variables tested were profitability, firm size, retained earnings, firm age, leverage, growth opportunities, price to earnings (P/E) and a dummy variable introduced for financial companies. To corroborate the results, two proxies were used to test the dependent variable: dividend yield and payout ratio. The results led to the identification of three significant determinants of dividend policy, which are firm age, growth opportunities and firm size. The negative correlation between the variables of firm size and firm age with dividend policy is explained by signaling theory. On the other hand, the negative correlation between growth opportunities and dividend payments is predicted by different theories, such as agency theory, financial flexibility theory and life cycle theory. This study provides insights for investors, analysts and researchers into dividend policy determinants on the Casablanca stock exchange based on firms' characteristic variables.

We provide a comprehensive study of how different corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate innovation. Using panel data regression analysis across a sample of more than 13,600 firm-years for firms based in the United States between 1996-2010, we find that entrenched boards, though commonly associated with lower firm value, actually generate substantial innovation. We find that busy boards hinder innovation unless they also have interlocking relationships. Conversely, interlocked directors enhance innovation, unless they are busy. Directors who are CEOs or Board Chairs at other companies hinder innovation. Interestingly, despite being significant determinants of firm value in other studies, director experience, independence and ownership are not related to innovation. In order to be innovative, firms should appoint directors to leverage their professional relationships and directors must have a long-term perspective. (c) 2022 by the authors.

This article evaluates the influence of ownership structure (OS) components on dividend distribution policy in India. More precisely, it aims to comprehend the impacts of promoters' shareholdings (PRMS), institutional investors' shareholdings (INS) and retail investors' shareholdings (RIS) on dividends of Indian listed companies. This article uses equity dividend divided by book value (DNW) to determine the dividend distribution policy for the selected panel of 80 listed companies for the period of 5 years (2016-2020). The static as well as dynamic panel data regression models are applied in the study. The static panel data regression results exhibit that none of the three OS explanatory variables (PRMS, INS and RIS) affect significantly the dividend distribution policy of Indian listed companies. Similar results are depicted by the dynamic panel data regression model also, thus ensuring robustness of the results. Hence, this article does not find support for agency theory, signalling theory and clientele effect. The study recommends that investors need not consider the composition of shareholding pattern of a company to have any significant influence on dividends while making their investment-decisions. The findings also add to the increasing studies across the globe evaluating the influence of OS on dividends. (c) 2022 Institute of Public Enterprise.

The goal of this paper is to study how firms' cash holdings have recently performed. We have not only used GMM approach, but also a pioneer econometric approach to evaluate the determinants of firms' cash holdings, ML-SEM. The results are more robust in comparison with those obtained using GMM. Our results showed that cash holdings have increased during the 2008 financial crisis and rose significantly after that time. The exception were firms placed in the United States and emerging markets. We have found that cash holdings, in general, were positively influenced by the banking system and capital market, although the results have been more robust for the first variable. Our results also showed that the development of the rule of law and shareholder rights lead to a decrease on firms' cash holdings, which confirms the agency theory as an explanation of firms' cash holdings.

This concept paper synthesises the special issue with an integrated discussion of all four papers published therein, from the viewpoint of the theme of this special issue: opportunities and challenges for future empirical research in corporate finance. The four papers highlight that future empirical research faces the challenge of acknowledging fundamental paradigms in the literature. These include analytical models of capital structure, agency theory, the literature on Initial Public Offering anomalies and earnings valuation. An opportunity for future empirical research is to use these foundations to contribute to emerging paradigms. The latter include the empirical evidence of the shareholder wealth effects of government investment, managerial overinvestment and the acknowledgement of unlisted entities within capital markets research.

The tenets of agency theory suggest that CEO inside debt holdings induce risk-reducing corporate investments. Further, the coinsurance hypothesis implies that diversification strategies designed to decrease cross-segment correlations reduce firm risk. Motivated by these views, we hypothesize a positive relationship between CEO inside debt holdings and the risk-reducing (e.g., coinsurance) effect of diversification. Moreover, we examine the impact of coinsurance, induced by CEO inside debt holdings, on the excess value of diversification. Using a sample of 4053 firm-year observations for the period of 2006-2013, we document a positive relationship between CEO inside debt and the extent of the coinsurance effect of diversification. In addition, consistent with the implications of the managerial risk aversion hypothesis that risk-reducing corporate diversification strategies destroy shareholder value, our results show that the coinsurance effect of diversification, when induced by CEO inside debt, negatively affects the excess value of diversification.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shareholder wealth arising from announcement returns of security issuance from a frontier market. It also explores the role of business group affiliation (BGA) on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses short-term scenarios to examine the link between CSR and shareholder wealth using the event study methodology which helps us mitigate the reverse causality problems related to studies of the relationship between CSR and firm value. Abnormal returns surrounding the security issue announcements were generated using the market model. Findings: This paper finds that security issuers with high CSR scores are associated with higher shareholder value. However, this paper finds that CSR activities of security issuers with BGA are value-destroying which is consistent with the agency perspective of CSR. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to only one nascent market, namely the Colombo Stock Exchange. Originality/value: This study documents that CSR and BGA are important determinants, among others, of stock price reactions to security offerings in emerging markets.

Recently ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) activities have attracted a lot of theoretical and practical attention. With these changes, there have been an active research on corporate social responsibility activities measured by ESG and major financial strategies of companies. Related with previous research, this study seeks to systematically analyze the association between social responsibility activities and dividend policieswww.earticle.net of corporations. Studies such as Rakotomavo (2012) and Benlemlih (2019) suggest that social responsibility activities have a positive impact on dividend policy, while studies such as Pham and Jung (2020) and Ni and Zhang (2019) report that social responsibility activities have a negative effect on dividend policy. In addition, the domestic previous research has analyzed the effect of social responsibility activities on dividends by using a simple OLS regression. These studies have not considered the endogeneity problem of variables and the partial adjustment of dividends with panel data. They did not investigate the relation between corporate social activities and stability of dividends either. Studies on these topics with Korean firms are still lacking. The dividend theory has been greatly developed with signaling theory, agency theory, and life cycle theory based on the dividend-irrelevance theory of MM (1961). If the signal theory of dividends is true, it can be argued that social responsibility activities will affect dividend payout level positively (Benlemlih, 2019). If the outcome hypothesis of agency theory of dividend is true, social responsibility activities will show a positive relationship between dividend levels (Adjaoud and Ben-Amar, 2010), conversely, if substitute hypothesis of agency theory is true, social responsibility activities and dividend levels will show a negative (-) relationship (John and Knyazeva, 2006). According to life cycle theory, corporate social activities have a positive association with dividend payout (Rakotomavo, 2012). In addition, Benlemlih (2019) shows that the companies with excellent levels of social responsibility activities prefer to have more stable dividend policy in order to signal a reduction in agent costs through dividend and a sound management policy. Matos, Barros and Sarmento (2020) also show that the firms with more sustainability have more stable dividend policies by using data from the European securities market. These studies imply that social responsibility activities are expected to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policies. This study utilizes the ESG ratings provided by the Korea Corporate Governance Service as the measures of CSR/ESG activities of firms. We collected the data from the non-financial firms listed in Korea security market during the period of 2013 through 2019. The financial data required for analysis used the KIS-VALUE database of Korea Credit Evaluation Information. The information about the major shareholders' equity was collected from the section of ownership status in the annual reports of the firms. The samples used in this study are 4,126 firm-year unbalanced panel data. The empirical analysis was conducted by applying a fixed effect panel analysis and a two-stage fixed effects panel analysis using the industrial average of social responsibility activities as an instrumental variable for social responsibility activities to alleviate the endogenous problem of social responsibility activities. The results of the analysis are as follows: First, the empirical results show that the ESG activities of the company have different effects on dividend level according to the measures of dividend payout. When dividend payout ratio (dividend/net income) is used for the dependent variable, only the social rating has been analyzed to have a statistically significant and positive effect on dividend. On the other hand, when dividend rate (dividend/total asset) and dividendwww.earticle.net yield(dividend/stock price) are used as dependent variables, the company's ESG integration rating, environmental rating, social rating, and governance rating have been shown to have a significant and positive impact on dividend. These results shows that the increase in corporate social responsibility activities among corporate ESG activities can improve the dividend propensity of companies. Since the dividend payout ratios of Korea firms remain relatively low, it is suggested that the company's social responsibility activities should be strengthened more in order to increase dividend propensity. In addition, it can be confirmed that the company's ESG activities have a significant and positive impact on the dividend level of the company, so that the company should be more interested in ESG for sustainability. In other words, the more a company have interests in the various stakeholders of the firm, the more profitable it is for shareholders. Second, this the findings can be explained by the outcome hypothesis of agent theory and the life cycle hypothesis. The cash ratio, which is the proxy variable of the agency issue, has a significant and positive effect on dividend propensity. Cash ratio, majority shareholder equity, foreign equity have a positive association with the dividend ratios, and the majority shareholder's ownership has a significant and positive impact on dividend yield. In addition, it was also confirmed that the ratios such as operating cash flow/total assets, earned surplus/total assets, and gross operating profit/total assets, which are the proxies of life cycle theory, are significantly and positively associated with the dividend rate. The variables such as market value/book value, earned surplus/total asset, gross operating profit margin have a significant and positive impact on the dividend yield. Third, the ESG activities were analyzed to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policy. The better the ESG activity, the higher the target dividend level, and the faster the difference between the target dividend level and the actual dividend level was adjusted. This means that the better the ESG activity, the higher the sustainability, and the higher the dividend level can be maintained. Since the company is more profitable with better ESG activity, it can be adjusted to the target dividend level more quickly. (c) 2022, Korean Finance Association. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The issue of tax evasion through fraudulent financial reporting committed by companies is a major concern facing the tax authority in Malaysia. As such, the purpose of this study is to propose a cohesive model of predicting tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting amongst small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) taxpayers. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model for this study is designed to explore the extent of the relationships between the independent variables: family ownership firms, company size, presence of tax professionals, company's duration in business and frequency of tax audits and the moderating variable, i.e. tax audit officers' level of competence; and the dependent variable, i.e. tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting. This study is grounded on four theories: agency theory, political cost theory, economic deterrence theory and competency theory. Data will be gathered from actual audit cases resolved by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia. Ordinary least square regression analysis is proposed for the investigation. Findings: This study anticipates that family ownership firms, company size, presence of tax professionals, company's duration in business and frequency of tax audits could be associated with tax evasion amongst SMEs in Malaysia. This study further proposes that highly competent tax audit officers could mitigate the relationship between frequency of tax audits and tax evasion practices amongst SMEs in Malaysia. Originality/value: This study should be able to provide a cohesive model of predicting tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting amongst SMEs in Malaysia. Research on fraudulent financial reporting amongst SMEs is very limited, especially involving the level of competence of the tax audit officers; therefore, this study should contribute to the tax evasion literature by providing a comprehensive model of predicting tax evasion through fraudulent financial reporting using a Malaysian tax setting.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

We develop a two-stage model to study the strategic interaction between a politician (the principal) and a bureaucrat (the agent) over the level of infrastructure provision with uncertainty about possible weather shocks. The bureaucrat chooses how much effort to contribute to infrastructure maintenance and the politician offers either a lump-sum wage (non-corrupt) contract or proportional bribe (corrupt) contract to induce effort. The degree of uncertainty about weather shocks, the size of the fixed wage, and the level of external monitoring to detect corruption all interact to affect (a) the politician's choice of contract and (b) whether this choice improves infrastructure outcomes. Our results suggest that curbing corruption is most likely to yield improvements in infrastructure provision when climate uncertainty is low and when bureaucratic wages are relatively high. If climate uncertainty is high, increasing monitoring has an unambiguous negative effect on infrastructure provision. Previous literature has focused either on public goods provision but not corruption or on bribery in a regulatory context that lacks public goods provision. We extend both literatures by analyzing how bribes between government officials affect a principal's ability to more effectively incentivize public goods provision by her agent.

The aim of this study is to examine a possible relationship of corporate financial performance and board membership changes. As a consequence, whether too little or too much board membership changes would produce a detrimental impact to financial performance. Furthermore, this study investigated whether this effect is more pronounced in family firms over non-family firms. Based on the agency theory and stewardship perspective, the results indicate that board membership changes are significant for family firms towards short-term financial performance indicators, with positive effect above a certain interval, though it signaling to the market may not be relevant. Also provides insightful examination of a specific corporate governance issue that is valuable both for academics and practitioners. (c) 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.

This article aims to summarise a significant number of previous qualitative and quantitative researches in order for scholars to reconsider their understanding of corporate governance mechanisms. The fundamental purpose of examining corporate governance practices is to define the way earnings management can be reduced. The findings show unclear conclusions concerning the board of directors' and the committee's characteristics on earnings management. That is why adopting corporate governance mechanisms strives for reducing the 'agency' problem. Furthermore, researchers can monitor the impact of corporate governance mechanisms by focusing on recent literature (2019, 2020, 2021). Future research in this area is therefore being promoted. Implementing corporate governance in companies is a given, as it can ensure their effectiveness and increase their credibility and prestige. Adopting corporate governance practices mitigates earnings management phenomena, and companies make the right decisions for their smoother operation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate governance developed to maintain the accountability, stability, and performance of corporations. It has evolved to concern not just the financial health of the company, but its social and environmental impact. There is considerable international institutional diversity in corporate governance. The role and significance of market institutions varies among different governance systems. This work provides a concise insight into the defining impulses of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century corporate governance evolving through a series of competing epoch-making paradigmatic contests. The present paradigm highlights a shift towards corporate sustainability involving the corporate delivery of long-term value in financial, social, environmental, and ethical terms. In analysing the purpose of the company and the definition of value creation, the hegemony of agency theory and shareholder primacy is challenged. More expansive theoretical explanations are considered which recognise the deeper values companies are built upon, the wider purposes they serve, and the broader set of relationships they depend upon for their success. This book will be of value to researchers, scholars, and students in corporate governance, sustainability, business, and accounting. Managers, professionals, and other general business readers will also find this text of interest. (c) 2023 Thomas Clarke.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

This study uses human capital that shows the intangible asset's core in reducing the risk or improving firm performance to solve previous inconsistent results of women's role in firm performance. Thus, this paper examines the role of human capital as the mediator in the influence of gender diversity on credit risk in a rural bank. This examination involves 433 rural banks based on the purposive sampling method. The result reveals that higher gender diversity has higher human capital (a = 0.135, r = 0.005) and higher human capital has lower credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It also revealed that when gender diversity is controlled by human capital as a mediator on credit risk, gender diversity does not affect credit risk (a = -0.022, r = 0.625). However, human capital still affects credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It implies that the higher a woman on the board of directors, the lower the credit risk through her education competence. Women as organization leaders have high self-appreciation from organization members in implementing their strategies and supervising them. High credit risk in rural banks needs appropriate management as a part of an internal governance mechanism. This study contributes to gender diversity literature through the ability to manage risk in measuring women's role as strategic agents. This study also contributes to investor protection through the reputation of women on boards as monitoring agents.

The current research envisages the ownership structure and earnings management nexus in the context of the effective monitoring hypothesis and myopic institutions hypothesis. The ownership aspects, including, shareholdings by the management, institutions, foreign institutions, pension funds, investment companies, and mutual funds are analyzed. The study follows Kothari et al. (2005) for the estimation of discretionary accruals and applied Arellano and Bond dynamic panel estimation to test the models based on a sample of 206 non-financial firms over the period of 2015-2019. The results of the study supported the agency theory, effective monitoring hypothesis, and myopic institutions hypothesis. Consistent with the previous empirical studies, the results reveal that managerial and institutional ownership curtails earnings management practices and discourages myopic management. Furthermore, the analysis of institutional investors based on their investment objectives reveals that the ownership of pension funds and investment companies restrains earnings management practices. On the other hand, discretionary accruals increase monotonically due to the existence of ownership by mutual funds. Furthermore, the study also provides a beer insight to regulatory authorities in order to design policies in such a way that ensures the protection of minority shareholders.

This study empirically examines the impact of board gender diversity on corporate performance, payout policy, and investment efficiency using a sample of 1021 firms listed in Asia Pacific markets for 2006-2016. Using fixed effect regression models, the results suggest that having a woman director on the corporate board enhances the investment efficiency and increases the propensity of dividend payout of the firms as compared to companies that do not have a women director. Nevertheless, the presence of a women director has an impact on weakening corporate performance. The results are robust across alternative measures of gender diversity. The study concludes that the presence of a woman director in the boardroom grants company a competitive edge over its competitors. (c) 2022 Inderscience Publishers. All rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the firm's ownership and control structure and its leverage. Capital structure is not only the result of various financial characteristics of the firm but also depends on who is in control. Thus, it is fundamental to understand the influence that certain features of the shareholding structure or the composition of the board, including the potential differences between family and non-family firms, exert on capital structure decisions. The paper uses a sample of wine firms in Portugal, because it helps to capture a business sector where family firms make up a significant portion of the industry. It is used an unbalanced panel data set of 460 firms for the period 2010 to 2018 and applied a random-effects model specification. Our results do not evidence significant differences between family and non-family firms. Still, they indicate that firms with fewer shareholders, smaller boards, and where the main director or member of the board is also a shareholder tend to present higher debt levels. There is no evidence of a non-monotonic relation between the ownership structure and debt, nor the presence of moderating effects on that relation. This paper fills a gap in the literature as the impact that specific characteristics of firms and their leaders have on capital structure decisions is still a topic less studied in the literature, particularly in bank-based economies.

This study examines the effect of family control on the price reaction to rights issue announcements of publicly listed firms in Indonesia during the period of 2005-2018. The study uses agency theory, which discusses the conflict of interest between controlling/majority and non-controlling/minority shareholders. The results show that the price reaction to the right issue announcements for publicly listed firms in Indonesia is statistically significantly negative. The mean of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) falls between -1.40% (for the Day 0 window period) and -3.43% (for the -5 to +5 window period). Further examination indicates that family control is associated with a more negative price reaction to these rights issue announcements. Specifically, for rights issue announcements of family firms, the mean cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) fall between -1.98% at announcement day (Day 0) and -5.23% for the event window period (-5 to +5). Meanwhile, for rights issue announcements of non-family firms, the current study found statistically insignificant price reactions to rights issue announcements for all the event window periods. These findings suggest that investors perceive higher agency problems among family firms where the family controlling shareholders tend to misuse and tunnel the rights issue funds for their own private benefit.

In modern organizations, there is a separation between ownership and control of the firm. On the lenses of agency theory, this study statistically examines the relationship between ownership structure (i.e., ownership concentration and owner identity) and firm performance of non-financial listed firms of Pakistan by taking firm-level control variables of size, age, liquidity, financial leverage, and growth of the firm. Secondary data is collected from annual reports of 65 non-financial listed firms for the year 2008 to 2012. The least-square dummy variable model followed by the random effect model has been employed to statistically determining the impact of ownership structure on firm performance. The results of the least square dummy variable model reveal that the ownership concentration has a significant positive impact on firm performance. The owner identity (such as dispersed, family, institutional, and government ownership) has a significant causal effect on firm performance as indicated from t and p values. (c) 2022 by IGI Global.

Firms are defined by a set-up of associations that represent contractual provisions for financing, capital structure, managerial ownership and recompense. It has been observed from business history that these relationships have disagreements but virtually every party has alleged to the overall objective of good performance of the business. Previous studies have investigated the relationship among various parties within a firm and the impact on performance through agency theory as this theory leads to separation of ownership and control. But the results of previous studies are rather mixed due to disparity in measures of ownership and performance. This study looks for examining performance under different and detailed list of ownerships and composition of board. Using panel data an attempt was made to study the association between ownership pattern and firm performance for all the major industries listed on BSE 500 index.

This study examines how controlling shareholders affected efficiency in Taiwanese electronics firms for the period of 2005-2017. This study measures firm efficiency using a dynamic data envelopment analysis model, which returns scores ranging from zero (not efficient) to one (efficient). Our regression results find that controlling shareholders' levels of shareholdings have significant negative effects on firm efficiency when their shareholding levels are low. However, there is a positive relationship between controlling shareholders' levels of shareholding and firm efficiency when the percentage of their shareholdings is high. These nonlinear results are also confirmed when we use board seat control rights held by the controlling shareholders. This study contributes to the field of corporate governance, specifically in the application of agency theory related to principal-principal relationships. Overall, findings suggest policy-makers should not consider solely controlling shareholders' levels of shareholdings, but also their board seat control rights.

Independent directors on a firm's board are theorized to enhance corporate governance by mitigating agency conflicts. However, some independent directors, referred to as grey directors, have prior relationships with managers that may hamper this role. Using data for Philippine firms, we construct a measure that categorizes independent directors as truly independent or grey, based on the 12 criteria used to define board independence as stipulated in the 2017 Philippine Corporate Governance Code. This measure is used to examine which firms are more likely to appoint grey directors and how the presence of grey directors affects firm performance. Consistent with agency theory, we find that firms with higher ownership concentration are more likely to have grey directors. However, we find that the presence of these grey directors does not adversely affect firm performance. We conclude that while grey directors are common among Philippine firms, their presence does not appear to escalate agency problems. (c) 2022 by De La Salle University.

To defeat myopic brand management, we need to understand better what motivates executives to invest in brand building. Drawing from agency theory, we argue that a better alignment of executives` and shareholders` interests can help. Tests using longitudinal compensation data of chief executive officers (CEO) from 123 public firms suggest that decreasing the sensitivity of CEO`s Equity-Based Compensation (EBC) to the firm`s stock price and increasing its sensitivity to the firm`s stock return volatility are associated with higher brand equity. Weak governance somewhat offsets these effects. Moreover, we find that the impact of EBC on brand equity is partially mediated through the firm`s strategic emphasis. Our research highlights the importance of understanding managerial incentives as drivers of brand equity. (c) 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.

This study investigates the effects of foreign return-oriented shareholders and domestic relational shareholders of Japanese companies on the earnings management behavior of their invested firms when stock option pay is adopted. We theorize that foreign shareholders seek short-term returns and do not engage in close monitoring due to an information disadvantage while domestic shareholders prevent managerial behavior that distorts information disclosure. Our findings show that managers of firms that use stock option pay engage in earnings management to increase their private financial benefits and meet capital markets' expectations, which allows them to enhance their own reputation. However, this managerial behavior is contingent on the firm's ownership structure. Our results show that while foreign shareholders enhance the positive impact of stock options on earning management, domestic shareholders and affiliated directors mitigate this positive effect. Our empirical analyses support the argument that ownership heterogeneity is a key determinant of managerial propensity to engage in earnings management when Japanese firms adopt stock option pay.

Prior literature acknowledges that, despite its importance in accounting research and practice, there is little understanding of how accruals (i.e., non-cash component of earnings) behave. To extend the literature on the complex behavior of accruals, this study examines how the asymmetric behavior of accruals is affected by managerial incentive structure. Built upon the agency theory, this study predicts that the "reverse" asymmetric behavior of accruals (i.e., being more sensitive to sales decreases than to sales increases) is mitigated (amplified) when the incentive structure for CEOs relies relatively more on short-term cash bonus (long-term incentives). The empirical results based on a sample of 26,183 firm-year observations for S&P 1500 companies are highly consistent with the prediction. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

Though managerial ties are substitutes for the weak market-supporting institutions in developing and emerging countries, little is known about the contingent value of these ties in credit markets. In this study, we disintegrate managerial ties into political and financial ties, and examine their effect on access to finance. Using agency theory, we propose that political and financial ties reduce information asymmetry between firms, politicians and banks, culminating in increased access to bank loans for firms. We also propose that CEO duality, through its influence on corporate governance and information consolidation, strengthens (weakens) the effect of financial (political) ties on access to finance. Using survey data from Ghana, we found support for our propositions. Overall, this study shows that the value of managerial ties is contingent on CEO duality. It also suggests that CEO duality is a double-edged sword with corporate governance and information implications for credit access in developing economies. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The aim of this paper is to shed the light on the concepts of agency theory by measuring one of the problems that arise from it, which is represented by earnings management (EM) practices. The research problem is demonstrated by the failure of some Iraqi banks and their subsequent placement under the supervision of the Central Bank of Iraq, which was attributed, in part, to the inadequacy of the agency model in protecting stakeholders in shareholding institutions, as well as EM, pushed professional institutions to adopt the corporate governance model as a method to regulate the problem of accounting information asymmetry between the parties to the agency. We are using the Beneish M-score model and the financial analysis equations in the Beneish model for bank data for both the income statement and the financial position to do so. The sample includes 30 Iraqi banks listed on the Iraq Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017, with the goal of inferring agency problems through EM practices. The results show that there are problems for the agency in the research sample banks throughout the research periods, and the percentages of those problems vary from one year to another. Apart from detecting agency problems, the art of financial ratios that have been used can be useful for auditors in conducting financial analyses, and thus they can be used as tools to detect fraud, given those agency problems resulting from profit manipulation are only aspects of fraud in the financial statements.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study examines the relationship between the accounting information quality, tax avoidance, and political connection in all Jordanian companies listed on Amman Stock Exchange. The current study also investigates the moderating effect of political connections on accounting information quality and company performance relationships. Further, the study examines the moderating effect of political connection on tax avoidance and company performance relationship. Theoretical framework: Political connections, tax avoidance, and the quality of accounting information affect a company's performance. According to the agency theory, reliable accounting information improves business performance and resources' allocation efficiency by reducing information asymmetry. Additionally, the adverse effects of politics on companies are mitigated by accounting information quality. As a result, the cash flow is allocated effectively, improving the business's overall performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the ordinary least squares (OLS) and applied moderated multiple regression (MMR). The sample data of this study includes 2266 company-years observations over the period 2008-2018 for all Jordanian companies listed on Amman Stock Exchange. The study compares accounting and market-based measurements of companies' performance (ROE, Tobin's Q). Findings: The study reveals consistent results among the measure. The results support the agency theory and found that accounting information quality reduces information asymmetry and positively affects companies' performance. Also, tax avoidance helps the companies to have more cash, and the results indicate a significant positive effect on companies' performance. In addition, the results support the agency theory argument and found that politics increase agency costs and negatively affect companies' performance. However, further analysis found that political connections sustain the positive effect of accounting information quality, which is a robust governance mechanism in Jordanian listed companies. Finally, the results found that tax avoidance with more political connections harms companies' performance. Research, Practical & Social implications: This study helps policymakers increase the governance mechanisms function in Jordanian listed companies. Also, the higher political relationship with the companies could be affected negatively on the Jordanian companies' achievement. Originality/value: The findings suggest several consequences for the fields of accounting and corporate governance. Additionally, the Middle East nations, including the Jordanian market, have had numerous economic difficulties that this study aids in resolving. For example, antagonistic political ties, information asymmetry, and insufficient allocation of financial resources. (c) 2022 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The authors investigate the impact of governance on the leverage of East Asian firms in the financial crisis context, in order to understand the puzzle whether debt acts as a substitute for governance or an outcome of the governance mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 86,030 firm-years and the country-level governance data from eight East Asian countries over the period 1996-2017. The authors employ the fixed effects (FE) model, in the main analysis and the weighted least squares model, as a robustness check in order to compare the two competing hypotheses of agency theory, substitute and outcome models. Findings: The authors' results show that debt acts as a substitute for governance before the GFC, but during and after the GFC the picture changes. Namely, debt acts as an outcome of the governance mechanism during the GFC and its aftermath. Since during financial downturns both agency costs increase, and information asymmetry widens, firms in poor-governed countries may be reluctant to increase their leverage in order not to face financial distress and additional restrictions. Thus, the results imply that the use of debt as a tool to mitigate agency conflicts and a substitute for governance strongly depends on the environment that the firms operate and the general macroeconomic conditions, such as facing a financial crisis or not. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an interesting case of the firms' capacity to raise money during a crisis and that governance plays an important role in borrowing activities of firms. This will undoubtedly help motivating owners and policymakers for improving governance. The authors' findings may be useful for policymakers to develop policies considering the adverse effects caused by exogenous shocks. This is crucial because the severity of GFC as a shock seems to change the macro and institutional environment that firms operate. While the authors properly address the research hypotheses using country governance data, future research may employ corporate governance data to attain firm-level results by testing two competing hypotheses. Originality/value: There are several important areas where this study makes original contributions. First, while Tsoy and Heshmati (2019) focus on the dynamics of capital structure for only Korean firms, the authors extend the sample including eight East Asian countries considering the impact of country governance on capital structure policy. Specifically, this study is the first in using the robust country governance data, which differs by country and year, in the crisis context. Next, the authors investigate both the AFC and GFC to compare whether these two crises have different effects on capital structure policy of East Asian firms. Finally, the authors aim to understand whether leverage is used as a substitute for governance or an outcome of governance mechanism considering recessions. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The alignment among multiple stakeholder benefits is a valuable performance indicator for the benefits generated by a firm for various stakeholders. Our research seeks to augment stakeholder-agency theory with an institutional perspective to analyze how national institutions affect stakeholder benefit alignment. We suggest that the current development of stakeholder-agency theory has overlooked the alignment of different stakeholders' benefits and the external institutional contexts as critical determinants in ensuring such alignment. We conceptualize stakeholder benefit alignment as a positive relationship between different stakeholder groups' benefits, and propose an institutional framework grounded in relative stakeholder salience. Using this framework, we argue that stakeholder benefits are better aligned when national institutions enhance the ease of withdrawal, legal protection, and private enforcement for intrinsically less salient stakeholders, and when a long-term oriented culture characterizes a society. We found supportive evidence by employing a meta-analytic approach based on 530 correlations from 94 primary studies representing 23 economies. Our study adds new insights to the stakeholder-agency literature by conceptualizing and quantitatively examining the degree of alignment across different stakeholder benefit dimensions, focusing on national formal and informal institutions as boundary conditions.

The literature has explored an association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure and accounting conservatism. This paper investigates how state ownership moderates this relationship in the context of the emerging Russian economy. Using a sample of 223 publicly listed Russian companies for the period of 2012-2017, we find that companies with higher CSR disclosure tend to have more conservative financial reporting practices. We observe, however, that state ownership has a negative moderating effect on this association, in line with agency theory. Moreover, we explore the unique structure of Russian companies' state ownership, whereby public companies often have a combination of federal, regional, and municipal state ownership, the outcome of privatization reform. We find that federal state ownership alone or in combination with regional or municipal levels of state ownership has a significantly negative impact on the CSR disclosure-accounting conservatism association. We find no evidence that a regional or municipal level of state ownership, a combination of regional and municipal levels of state ownership, or a combination of all three levels has an impact on the association between CSR disclosure and reporting conservatism. We address the recent call for a contextualized approach that focuses on institutional, legal, and cultural features of different economies to advance our knowledge of the antecedents of CSR disclosure, its association with reporting quality, and the factors that moderate it.

After two decades of research on Emerging Market Multinational Enterprises (EMNE), the debate still concerns the antecedents and strategies of their foreign expansion. However, much less has been said on the effects of international participation on their productivity. Building on insights from the Resource-Based View of the firm and agency theory, we develop hypotheses on the presence of complementarities among export, import and R&D and their impact on productivity. Our empirical analyses on a panel of 23,000 time-year observations of Ukrainian MNEs over the period 2000-2006, confirm that: (i) EMNEs benefit from complementarities stemming from the assimilation and integration of knowledge from international external sources (import and export) with internal knowledge (own R&D investment); (ii) the effect is more pronounced for private-owned enterprises (POEs) rather than state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and (iii) especially when they trade with partners in/from advanced markets.

The purpose of this study is to gauge the efficacy of theories of corporate governance in alleviating bankruptcy in the Indian context. The study uses logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model on a sample of 680 firm observations. Two-stage least squares regression is employed to mitigate endogeneity issues. Main results support agency theory in terms of CEO non-duality, low CEO compensation, and concentrated ownership variables, and defend resource dependence theory with respect to large board size and high directors' attendance, for precluding bankruptcy. Internal and external governance mechanisms are more favourable in 5 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years prior to bankruptcy, respectively. The predictive power of governance models is found to be better than of financial models in 5 to 4 years prior to bankruptcy. Combined models involving both governance and financial variables outperform standalone governance or financial models and are most accurate in the fifth year preceding bankruptcy. Additional tests show that the time availability of independent directors holds more importance over their resourcefulness in the initial years of distress. This study has a few key takeaways for stakeholders, companies, and regulating bodies. It is suggested that regulators enforce CEO non-duality and necessitate a minimum number of board meetings to be attended per year by the directors. This is one of the first studies to develop a corporate governance model on bankruptcy in the Indian context since the enactment of its new bankruptcy code.

Purpose: This paper examines whether ownership type has a moderating influence on dividend payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with respect to changes in profits. Future uncertainties because of the pandemic will result in a perceived need for liquidity within the company, but retaining cash may be risky for shareholders who could look for less risky alternatives. The dividend payout strategy is thus even more closely related to the overall type concentration and strategy of the owners during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The effects are explored and tested on early data from 2019 to 2020 of Finnish companies using ANCOVA while controlling for profitability and sector variables. Findings: A significant effect on dividend payout during the COVID crisis was found when the companies are dominantly held by individual owners validating early suggestions on such an influence. Therefore, this study contributes further to the academic debates on the influence of ownership concentration in times of crises. This study lists certain sectors which experience diminished profits during such a crisis which pinpoints sector separation in future discussions. Research limitations/implications: This study explores early data from a specific context in the Nordic countries. However, it does so out of purpose as explained in the paper. Practical implications: Ownership type and concentration matters when it comes to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty with regard to changes in profit. Investors need to accept these behavioural insights into their decisions. Originality/value: This study examines the signalling effect of dividends by analysing how actual or anticipated change in profitability due to a crisis is reflected by owners and leads to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of corporate governance mechanisms, namely, board of directors and auditors, on tax aggressiveness in Italian companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a population of 168 Italian non-financial firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, holding shares in at least one foreign subsidiary in countries other than Italy in fiscal year 2018. Data on corporate boards and auditors were collected through the evaluation of companies' annual reports over the period 2011-2018. Five panel data analyses with fixed effects were performed for each tax aggressiveness index, yielding 1,176 observations to test the research hypothesis. Findings: This paper finds that corporate board characteristics, such as size, gender diversity and CEO duality, and auditors' features, such as external audit quality, increase corporate tax aggressiveness. Practical implications: This study provides investors with an understanding of corporate boards' and auditors' roles in preventing agency conflicts and evaluating a company's tax approach. Furthermore, the findings are useful for international political bodies in regulating corporate board composition and managerial monitoring. Originality/value: Almost all studies focusing primarily on corporate governance mechanisms' effects on tax aggressiveness are within the US context. Empirical evidence on the topic in the European contexts is limited. The legislative discrepancy between countries is reflected in the computation of indices measuring tax aggressiveness, affecting US studies' generalizability across nations. This paper extends the literature on the topic by investigating other unexplored corporate governance mechanisms. Five indices were used to measure corporate tax aggressiveness and to assess analysis reliability and data robustness. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the link between corporate governance mechanisms and tax aggressiveness in Italy.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the drivers for proactive workplace social performance in family firms through a configurational approach. Comparative research on family versus non-family firms and workplace social performance has produced mixed results. Consequently, several calls have been made to account for family business heterogeneity to understand better how family involvement in the business affects the workplace social performance. The authors respond to these calls by exploring the governance antecedents that can catalyze family firms' workplace social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyze 131 family firms from the STEP survey data. Findings: The authors find two governance configurations that lead to better family business workplace social performance. The first configuration is the combination of 100% family ownership, high family involvement in management and a mix of outside directors and family members on the board. The second configuration is the combination of less than 100% family ownership and low family involvement in management. Originality/value: The study builds on and extends the nascent work suggesting the integration of agency and stewardship theories. The authors show that these two theoretical approaches are able to not only coexist, but that they can also be complementary in helping to understand the unique workplace social behaviors of family firms.

Acknowledging the global relevance of controlling corruption, our study contributes to the existing body of literature by exploring the relationship between E-Government (EGOV) and Corruption Control at the EGOV subindices level. Toward this, we draw upon theoretical insights from Resource-Based View (RBV), Media Literacy Theory, Agency Theory, Information Quality, and Transaction Cost Theory to derive a set of testable hypotheses. Using a panel dataset comprising 102 countries, we employ a Linear Mixed Effects (LME) estimation method to thoroughly investigate and uncover the relative effectiveness of EGOV subindices in controlling corruption. Accordingly, we draw implications for theory, praxis and future research. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on principal-principal agency theory and the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective, this paper explores the motivations and mechanisms regarding the founding family's contingent choices of governance provisions that facilitate managerial entrenchment, which can potentially threaten firm performance. By investigating S&P 1,500 firms between 2007 and 2017 and employing quasi-experimental treatment effects analyses, this study finds that family firms are less likely to utilize the E-index provisions than non-family firms in general. Further, family firms tend to adopt more E-index provisions when the first generation of the founding family remains involved in the firm. However, as these firms age, they rely less on the E-index provisions to entrench family managers. Consequently, this paper expands current research on the governance of publicly-traded family firms by illustrating the differences between family and non-family firms as well as the impact of transgenerational family governance on the use of entrenchment mechanisms over time.

This paper explores how contracts in private equity-backed buyouts shape corporate governance in portfolio companies. Drawing upon agency theory and incomplete contracting theory, 50 actual contracts are analyzed in detail. Contracts focus on reducing adverse selection risks through limiting pre-investment information asymmetries and aligning the goals of investors and sellers. Moral hazard risks vis-a-vis management are limited through limiting post-investment information asymmetries and limiting shirking behavior through limiting free cash flows. Goal alignment is achieved through high-powered incentive structures combined with shifting risk of underperformance to management. Managerial hold-up problems are addressed through restricting share transactions and limiting managerial actions. Residual powers and contingencies are mainly used to deal with incomplete contract designs due to uncertainties. Few clauses are used to address the reverse agency problem in which management is protected against moral hazard problems created by the private equity investor. PE contracts have transparent and very strong outcome-based cash flow rights, both limiting downside risk and rewarding upside potential. This contrasts with VC contracts which are especially contingency-based given the high levels of uncertainty of the portfolio companies.

The aim of this study was to examine the moderating effect of ownership concentration (OC) on the relationship between impactful female directors and earnings management (EM). The study concentrated on firms with the lowest positive earnings, measured by return on assets. The results showed that OC positively moderated the association between impactful female directors and accrual earnings management (AEM). With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became positively associated with AEM. In terms of real earnings management (REM), the results showed that OC weakened the significant negative relationship between impactful female directors and REM that was found in the direct regression. With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became insignificantly associated with REM. The study is extremely beneficial to policymakers, stakeholders, researchers, and society. It provides empirical findings that could help all parties to re-evaluate the role of the board of directors, specifically impactful female directors, in mitigating EM. The results highlight the impact of the majority shareholders, introduced by agency theory II, an issue that requires more solutions from regulators. (c) 2023 by the author.

Purpose: Building on behavioral agency theory, the authors explore the role played by corporate governance characteristics as drivers of the diversification strategies of family firms. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the effects of board size and board gender diversity on the likelihood that family firms will execute a diversifying acquisition vis-a-vis a related acquisition. Furthermore, the authors investigate the contingency effects played by foreign directorship and the firm's listing status. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested on an original sample of 213 cross-border acquisitions executed by Italian family firms between 2008 and 2021. Findings: The findings suggest that both large board sizes and greater gender diversity positively affect the diversification of family firms. While the presence of foreign directors magnifies the positive effect of board size, gender diversity discourages diversification in the case of listed firms. Originality/value: The originality of this study is twofold. First, while prior literature has mostly focused on the family vs nonfamily dichotomy, this paper contributes to an emergent line of research investigating the heterogeneity among family firms' corporate strategy decisions. Second, by exploring the corporate governance-diversification link in the context of family business, the authors answer to recent calls that diversification by family firms deserves further investigation in light of its highly controversial nature in terms of socioemotional wealth implications and potential mismatch among multiple objectives.

We document strong evidence that CEO incentive compensation can predict the significance of stock price momentum through discretionary accrual and real activities manipulation. The profit of momentum strategy increases with CEO pay-for-performance incentive, but decreases with CEO risk-taking incentive. It also evaluates the effects of information uncertainty on such relationship. The evidence is more significant for firms with older and longer tenured CEOs and firms with more informed traders. The relationship between the profit of momentum strategy and CEO pay-for-performance incentive is stronger among CEOs without the risk-taking incentive. Our results are robust for different sub-samples based on before and after Reg FD and Sarbanes-Oxley Act, even after controlling for the potential endogeneity. Further, our findings are consistent with the information diffusion explanation of momentum and the agency theory that incentivised CEOs tend to manipulate information by smoothing good news, concealing mildly bad news and accelerating the disclosure of extremely bad news.

We use a novel measure of firm-level political risk based on a textual search technique on firms' quarterly earnings conference transcripts to explain dividend payouts in publicly listed U.S. firms. We find a positive and significant effect of firm-level political risk on dividend payouts, particularly in uncertainties related to economics, institutions, technology, trade, and security. The effect is more pronounced in firms with better corporate governance, less analyst follow-up, and higher growth opportunities. These results support the signaling role of dividends rather than the role of agency theory in explaining dividend payouts when firms are associated with higher levels of political risk. We also find the effect to be prominent after controlling for an aggregate measure of economic policy uncertainty and in poor economic conditions and in major political event periods. We address endogeneity concerns by running placebo tests and conducting instrumental variable analysis and we alleviate self-selection bias by performing propensity score matching technique.

<Abstract> This study examines the effect of the interaction between controlling shareholder ownership and product market competition on investment inefficiency in Korea. Consistent with classical agency theory, this study finds that the lower the controlling shareholder owner-ship, the greater the overinvestment. However, this relationship strengthens in non-competitive markets but disappears in competitive markets. This suggests that product market competition has a disciplinary effect on the incentive of controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits. This study has implications for the disciplinary effect of competition and expands the literature on agency theory in emerging countries with concentrated ownership structures.

This study analyzes the wealth impact on M&A deals when the acquirers in the financial industry utilize external versus in-house advising services. A quasi-natural observatory setting is applied to investigate the costs and benefits of retaining a financial advisor. Based on agency theory, information asymmetry and conflict of interest both exist in the setting of M&A deals when acquirers use advisory services. We first find that almost 40% of financial acquirers are more likely to use in-house advising services, the frequency of which is significantly higher than that of non-financial acquisitions previously documented. Further, we find that in certain complex deals of greater information asymmetry, the frequency of retaining advisory services in-house is even higher. This finding suggests that for financial acquirers who possess expertise in the M&A market, the concern of conflict of interests (i.e., misaligned incentives) between the acquirers and their advisors are more salient than the concern of information asymmetry. More importantly, using the two-stage regressions method controlling the endogeneity of the choice between in-house versus external advisory services, this study finds that the three-day abnormal returns around the acquisition announcements are 4.5% higher for the acquirers retaining in-house advisory services, 18.7% higher for the corresponding target, and the combined merger gains are 2.2% higher. Overall, our findings provide direct evidence of the agency cost when an external advisor is hired and document the incremental values that the financial acquirers' in-house advisory services may create.

Purpose: Good earnings quality (EQ) provides reasonable assurance as to the reliability of future cash-flow generation capability of the borrowing firms and thereby mitigates the credit risk of the banks. Against the backdrop of the stressed-assets problem in public-sector banks in India, adversely impacting the public finance system, this paper aims to explore the role of EQ of the borrowers in obtaining bank credit and the ways to mitigate the problem. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of listed 3,486 non-financial and non-government firms, the authors apply Jones (1991) model to estimate their EQ. Then, the authors conduct Hausman's (1970) test and find the existence of a two-way relation between bank finance and EQ. The authors adopt a two-stage least-square regression model to test the nature of the association between the two after controlling for firm and industry-level characteristics. Findings: The empirical results suggest that there exists a two-way negative association between EQ and bank finance implying that the Indian firms tend to report abnormal accruals to enhance tangibility for enjoying higher credit limits and easier access to bank finance. Also, the poor EQ is associated with earnings volatility, adversely impacting the credit quality. The findings are consistent. Practical implications: The study highlights the role of EQ in mitigating credit risk and addressing adverse selection problems in granting credit by practicing bankers. Originality/value: The findings of the study enrich the literature on EQ, capital structure, agency theory and public finance in several ways and have significant ethical and policy implications in bank-finance-led economies.

Purpose: This paper aims to combine the agency theory and efficiency wage theory to explore the effects of relative compensation for executive directors with marketing experience on two marketing outcomes (marketing efficiency and market share) and the moderating roles of ownership type (private vs state-owned enterprises) and market concentration in this process. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,753 firm-year observations from Chinese listed companies (from 2010 to 2014) were retrieved from China Stock Market and Accounting Research database and analyzed using firm random-effects with industry, year and region fixed effects. Findings: Relative compensation has a positive effect on both marketing efficiency and market share, and these effects are moderated by ownership type and market concentration. Specifically, the positive effect of relative compensation on marketing efficiency and market share are stronger for central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) compared to local SOEs and private-owned enterprises but the results are mixed for market concentration. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that paying higher compensation to the executive directors with marketing experience can enhance marketing performance, but the data does not allow identification of the actual actions taken by these directors for this. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of appropriate compensation for directors with marketing experience to motivate them to make better marketing decisions to overcome the challenges posed by market concentration and agency conflicts. Originality/value: This paper points out the importance of having directors with marketing experience and paying them suitable compensation to motivate them to be more effective.

Given that marriage transforms people, with wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts, we examine the role of CEOs' marital status on firms' cash holdings behaviour. Using a large sample of US-listed firms, we find that single CEOs stockpile more cash than their married counterparts do. Our finding is robust to controlling for various CEO characteristics, CFO influence, tackling endogeneity concerns and using alternative measures of cash. Moreover, we show that exogenous CEO turnover resulting in appointments of single (married) CEOs increases (decreases) cash holdings. Additional results show that single-CEO firms practise a more conservative payout policy and save more cash from operating and financing cash flows. Consistent with agency theory, single CEOs extract more compensation from the accumulated cash, leading to a lower value of cash holdings. External corporate governance mechanisms mitigate the relationship between single CEOs and cash holdings. Our results show that single-CEO firms are more prone to agency problems.

This article highlights the crucial areas and recent dynamics of the takeover field in family firms and recommends avenues for further research. Employing a bibliometric examination, this study analyzes a sample of 63 studies from the Scopus database on acquisition involving family firms between 1997 and early 2021. The study also performed a systematic literature review of the most significant articles as revealed by the computation. We obtain the prominent authors based on citation analysis. We also find current themes and suggest future research avenues. Despite the worldwide prevalence of family firms, there is less study on the takeover of family firms. The results also show that most of the articles are based on the few most studied theories, such as agency theory, resource-based view and stewardship and stagnation perspective, and so on. The scant studies on the takeover of family firms center around acquisition decisions, determinants of acquisition, and acquisition outcomes, with relatively less attention on measuring non-economic goals, board structure, and generation of family members. Finally, the results indicate that very few studies have focused on cross-industry and cross-country to examine the effect of family ownership on takeover events. (c) 2023 K. J.

This study reviews contemporary corporate governance (CG) in China. This is crucial because of the lack of awareness in the foreign investor community concerning the transparency and reliability of the second-largest economy's governance policy. The review offered in this study not only contributes to the expanding literature in relation to the Chinese CG model, but also further deepens the understanding of the governance issues concerning businesses operating in China among foreign institutional investors and foreign corporate practitioners. The significance of promoting the transparency and integrity of Chinese firms and capital markets is ensuring that firm assets are used diligently and effectively to safeguard the interests of investors and other relevant stakeholders. Moreover, this study sheds light on the latest developments in the Chinese capital market, regulatory framework, and CG perspective for managers of multinational firms to evaluate their potential direct investment decisions in China. In addition, this study provides a review of existing literature on whether Chinese CG is converging towards or diverging from the Anglo-American model, which may be helpful for the decision-making process of Chinese policymakers and regulators in relation to the formulation of new codes, regulations, and policies in the future.

Purpose: Public listing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) stimulates unremitting transformations into their corporate governance (CG) practices. These transformations in CG are likely to impact the financial performance (FP). The current study examines how individual corporate CG mechanisms and their mutual interactions (configurational approach) stimulate the FP of listed SMEs. The study selects promoters' ownership (PO), the board (B-INX) and information disclosures (DISC) as individual CG mechanisms. In addition, market competition (COMP) is considered a form of external governance/regulation. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses five years of panel data (2018-2022) of 80 SMEs listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) SME listing platform in India. Panel data fixed effects and cluster robust standard errors estimated. In addition to the impact of individual CG mechanisms, their mutual interactions (configurational approach) are tested using moderated hierarchical regression and confirmed by slope tests. Findings: The results signify the ineffectiveness of individual CG mechanisms when acting in silos. However, their mutual interactions drive the FP. A hierarchy of results is obtained. PO is the dominant form of internal CG, negatively influencing the relevance of B-INX and DISC. B-INX tends to adhere to good governance by positively moderating the impact of DISC on FP. Lastly, COMP acts as external governance that dominates the ownership effects. Findings reveal that the interactions among individual CG mechanisms are essential to the FP of listed SMEs. Such interactions adjust the agency theory dynamics of CG in these firms. Research limitations/implications: The study takes a holistic approach to investigate the agency theory dynamics via the mutual interactions among multiple CG forms. It highlights how the presence of a dominant form of CG can adjust the financial effect of others, thereby adjusting agency theory dynamics. Practical implications: These results hold practical significance for SMEs in multiple ways. SMEs should embrace configurational approach to comprehend their agency dynamics. The configurational approach of CG mechanisms is the way forward for SMEs, which are known to be financially constrained. In other words, the fact that the resiliency of SMEs is very often questioned calls for the configurational approach, where different CG mechanisms coexist to drive FP. Originality/value: The study is by far the first of its kind to investigate the CG of listed SMEs against the backdrop of the configurational approach. The findings will benefit industry practitioners, academics and regulatory bodies to visualize the governance practices through the lenses of configurational approach.

Agency conflicts increase with contract maturity. As contract maturity increases, managers, acting on behalf of shareholders, have more opportunities to use their discretion in ways that adversely affect future payoffs. Agency theory suggests that when contract maturity increases, creditors place less weight on a firm's growth opportunities in assessing default risk. We present a counter-argument: because the timing of future payoffs is uncertain, longer-duration debt provides creditors with a longer horizon over which payoffs are earned. Using credit default swap (CDS) spreads, we demonstrate that the relevance of future earnings expectations increases with CDS maturity. Our results suggest that contract maturity is not a reliable proxy for agency costs when evaluating the credit market relevance of financial information.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to understand how board structure, size of audit committee (AC), gender diversity and ownership structure influence banks' performance in Pakistan. This study also aims to examine how various dimensions of governance differently affect the different measures of bank performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study used panel estimation techniques to quantify the impact of various elements of corporate governance on bank performance by taking annual data of 19 Pakistani banks for the period 2013-2020. The corporate governance is measured by board size, CEO duality, AC size, ownership structure and gender diversity. To get the robust results, this study measures bank performance by considering different indicators, namely, return on assets, earning per share, technical efficiency (TE) and total factor productivity. The empirical investigation is based on several well-known and well-accepted governance theories such as the agency theory, the stewardship theory, the tokenism/critical mass theory and the information asymmetry theory. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that the size of board and ACs both significantly improve profitability and productivity, whereas they decrease TE. Further, the findings suggest that most of the indicators of gender diversity significantly deteriorate the performance of banks. However, ownership structure significantly improves banks' earnings per share and TE. This study further illustrates that CEO's duality does not have any significant impact on bank performance. This finding holds true for all the performance measures considered for this study. Practical implications: The findings are of great importance to various stakeholders, especially to policymakers to know about the factors influencing different measures of performance. Specifically, based on these findings, they can devise the result-oriented strategies to enhance the financial and real performance of banks. The findings also suggest that both investors and owners should take into consideration the governance indicators while evaluating banks' performance by using accounting, market-based, efficiency and productivity measures. Originality/value: This research adds to the vast body of existing knowledge about the effectiveness of corporate governance by investigating how the different dimensions of corporate governance and gender diversity influence bank performance in a developing country, namely, Pakistan. Further, this study elaborates the domestic rules/regulations, governance theories and governance framework and practices and tries to link the empirical findings with them for better understanding the role of governance in determining the performance of the banking sector of Pakistan.

Purpose: As shareholder-elected monitors, independent non-executive directors (INEDs) should ensure that managers do not retain earnings to promote their own interests. The relationship between board independence and dividend distributions was hence investigated for selected companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The country offers a well-developed corporate governance framework to listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Data on the considered companies' dividend payout ratios (DPRs), board independence and six control variables were obtained from Bloomberg for the period 2007-2021. The significance of the observed trends in these variables was considered by conducting analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) tests. The hypothesised relationship was assessed using a mixed-model regression. Findings/results: The results are in line with prior research showing that dividends are often omitted or reduced during and after crisis periods, that is, the global financial crisis (2008/2009) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2020/2021). A negative but statistically insignificant relationship was reported between DPR and board independence. Practical implications: Although board independence was not significantly related to dividend distributions for the sampled companies, INEDs still perform an important monitoring role. Shareholders are thus encouraged to play a more active role in the election of these directors. Originality/value: This study extends and refines previous research in South Africa and reveals new insights regarding board independence and dividend distributions during three King regimes and distribution-related regulatory changes.

Purpose: From an agency perspective, the authors investigate whether family ownership and control configurations are systematically associated with a firm's choice of auditor and audit fees. Agency theory is an economic theory that purposes the existence of a contract between two parties, principals and agents. Auditor choice and audit fees by family firms provide interesting insights given the unique nature of the agency problems faced by such firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ Big-4 auditors (PWC, KPMG, E&Y and Deloitte) as a proxy for high quality auditor (Big N) for the auditor choice model. For the audit fee model, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of audit fees (LnAF). The authors use two measures for family firm as explanatory variables: (1) a dummy variable (FAM_Control), which equals one if the firm is classified as a family firm and (2) FAM_Ownership, which is an indicator variable with a value of one if a firm has family members who hold CEO position, occupy board seats, or hold at least 10% of the firm's equity. Data of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2021 are used. The authors adopt the Heckman (1979) two-stage model to mitigate the potential endogeneity issue involved in the selection of Big-N auditors. Findings: The findings suggest that compared with non-family firms, Chinese family firms have a less tendency to employ Big-4 auditors due to less severe agency problems between owners and managers. Additionally, Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees than non-family firms. Similar to the prior literature, however, Chinese family firms audited by Big-4 auditors incur lower audit fees than family firms audited by non-Big-4 auditors in this study. In contrast to young-family firms, old-family firms are less likely to pick top-tier auditors and sustain lower audit fees. Consistent and robust results are found from endogeneity tests and sensitivity analyses. Originality/value: The empirical evidence provides a unique insight, for accounting practitioners, policymakers, family owners and other capital market participants concerning the diverse effects of various family ownership and control features on selecting high-quality auditors and audit fees. This study advances the understanding, showing that a lower demand for audit quality occurs in Chinese family firms as they encounter less severe Type I agency problems. However, the more severe Type II agency problems in Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees due to higher audit risk and greater audit effort. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study addresses the influence of sustainable institutional investors (SII), based on the signatory status of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), on corporate tax avoidance. Moreover, the moderating influence of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) is analyzed. The analyses concentrate on a European sample consisting of 1689 firm-year observations between 2014 and 2020 (EUROSTOXX 600) embedded in a stakeholder agency theoretical framework. Correlation, regression, and robustness analyses are conducted. The results are in line with prior studies on equity ownership and tax avoidance and indicate that SII have a negative impact on tax avoidance and that CSP strengthens this negative effect. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. SII represent a major monitoring mechanism in promoting responsible tax behavior, which is in line with other stakeholders' interests. Tax avoidance should be integrated into overall sustainability management to realize an increased firm reputation. As the European Commission initiated several regulations on sustainable finance, sustainability reporting, and tax disclosure, the empirical results stress the interdependencies between ownership structure, CSP, and tax avoidance. The study makes a major contribution to prior analyses, as this study is the first to assess the link between SII and tax avoidance and the moderating impact of CSP to urge top management to increase sustainability efforts.

Background: Chief executive officer (CEO) payment and company performance are highly controversial, and existing research has focused on this link for decades. The study was conducted in South Africa where corporate governance regulators have introduced measures to improve the relationship between CEO pay and performance. Aim: This research aimed to explore the problem by extending Pepper and Gore's (2015) behavioural agency theory to examine the moderating effect of remuneration governance on the CEO pay - company performance relationship. Setting: The study focused on the Top 100 listed companies in which several regulations concerning CEO pay were introduced, which provided the opportunity to examine such regulations on the alignment of CEO pay and company performance. Method: Panel data from 67 company annual reports were analysed over two decades with 871 datapoints, divided into three periods corresponding with the introduction of regulations. Analyses included corrected panel standard errors and estimated generalised least squared hierarchical multiple regression and moderated multiple regression analyses. Results: Results showed a statistically significant positive relationship between company performance measures and total CEO remuneration (including long-term incentives [LTIs]) for each of the three periods. We found that LTIs tied to performance-vested criteria and CEO minimum shareholding do enhance pay-performance sensitivity. Results further suggest that the behavioural agency theory is incomplete and researchers should consider the role of remuneration governance in moderating CEO overpayment. Conclusion: Remuneration governance should be refined through the inclusion of retrospective CEO remuneration disclosure to increase pay-performance sensitivity. Contribution: This research contributes to knowledge of CEO payment and company performance. (c) 2023. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Purpose: Firm performance has become a thriving research field. However, a review of previous studies shows that the answers to several fundamental questions remain vague and require further investigation. Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to determine the extent of the involvement of political connections (PCs) in Pakistani-listed companies, and the second is to examine the association between PCs and firm financial performance with director efficacy's moderating role. Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008-2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm's financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study's findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company's best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of ownership structure variables on the performance of Saudi listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of ownership structure variables on firm performance is examined using fixed effects and dynamic panel generalised method of moments regression approaches for 70 listed firms over the period 2016-2021. Ownership structure variables are captured by examining government, institutional, insider, foreign and family ownership, and firm performance is gauged in terms of the accounting-based measures of return on assets and the return on equity and the market-based measures of Tobin's Q and the market-to-book ratio. Findings: The results show that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership all positively affect both accounting and market-based performance measures, whereas family ownership exerts a negative impact across the models. The findings support resource dependence theory, agency theory and alignment effects arguments. Practical implications: The findings have significant implications for Saudi regulators in their effort to improve domestic capital market efficiency and investor protection, while also highlighting the need for a corporate governance code to safeguard minority shareholders. The results demonstrate that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership exert an important impact on firm operational and market performance. Originality/value: This study expands the literature by examining how ownership structure variables affect performance in an interesting developing country corporate context.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

We analyze the impact of Small Blockholders' (SBH-with 5% to 10% of voting rights) heterogeneity and their access to private information on the demand for audit services. By promoting enhanced audit services, we expect SBH to have a moderating effect on the relation between Large Blockholders (LBH-more than 10% of voting rights) and audit fees in a context of low shareholder protection. Drawn on Swiss public firm data over the 2002-2019 period, our results show that the presence of SBH flattens the concave relation between ownership concentration and audit fees found in prior studies. This moderating effect is mainly driven by the uninformed SBH, who given their lower-compared with informed SBH-access to private channels of information, are more likely to rely on audited public financial statements. Our findings contribute to the literature on the role of SBH in the company's corporate governance. (c) 2022 European Accounting Association.
