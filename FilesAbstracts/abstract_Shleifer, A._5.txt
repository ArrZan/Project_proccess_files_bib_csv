Collectively, institutions own an increasing proportion of outstanding corporate equities. As an emergent force in shaping corporate America, the linkages between institutional ownership and corporate social performance (CSP) require empirical examination. Not only do corporate policy makers need to know those areas where social performance may lure or inhibit capital infusions, lawmakers also need a better understanding of the social forces guiding corporate policy. As anticipated, this study found a positive relationship between the amount of institutional ownership of corporate stock and a company's social responsiveness as measured by the representation of women on its board of directors; however, no statistically significant relationship with social responsibility as measured by charitable giving was found. The exemplar of social issues management - compliance with the Sullivan principles - showed an unexpected, negative relationship with the level of institutional ownership.

Agency theory recognizes that the interests of managers and shareholders may conflict and that, left on their own, managers may make major financial policy decisions, such as the choice of a capital structure, that are suboptimal from the shareholders' standpoint. The theory also suggests, however, that compensation contracts, managerial equity investment, and monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders can reduce conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders. This research investigates the relationship between the firm's capital structure and 1) executive incentive plans, 2) managerial equity investment, and 3) monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders. This paper finds a positive relationship between the firm's leverage ratio and 1) percentage of executives' total compensation in incentive plans, 2) percentage of equity owned by managers, 3) percentage of investment bankers on the board of directors, and 4) percentage of equity owned by large individual investors. These findings are consistent with the predictions of agency theory, suggesting, in turn, that capital structure models that ignore agency costs are incomplete. (c) 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

Officers of large corporations, having demonstrated expertise in managing complex organizations, would appear to be ideal additions to the boards of directors of other corporations. Shareholder wealth effects are examined for 124 announcements in which an officer of one public corporation joins the board of directors of another. The results indicate that the values of nonfinancial firms that send directors to other firms decline significantly, while those of financial senders increase significantly. Receiving firms of both types do not gain. The results suggest that for nonfinancial firms the added duties of an outside directorship distract corporate officers from managing their own firms or are signals to the market that managers are available to other firms. For financial senders, the benefits of networking appear to strongly outweigh any drawbacks. Cross-sectional regressions suggest that prediction errors are higher for receiving firms if they have performed poorly prior to the announcement and less negative for sending firms if they have performed well prior to the announcement. Abnormal returns are negatively related to the size of the sender, adding support for the notion that busy executives are less valuable as outside directors.

The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between firm performance and the proportion of shares owned by directors for a sample of small and medium sized companies in the U.K. The paper also examines, however, the impact of organisational form on firm performance. The results suggest that, in contrast to the majority of large firm studies on the subject, a curvilinear relationship is found to exist between firm performance and the percentage of equity held by the board of directors. The return on assets of firms is found to increase as director ownership increases up to a maximum at 68.2% of ownership, after which it then decreases as director ownership approaches 100% of equity. In addition, the results suggest that firms whose directors are more highly remunerated and who hold directorships in other companies are significantly more profitable. Furthermore, firms in which the owners perceive present management practices to be lacking in structure are found to have significantly lower performance. (c) 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper examines the relationship between a Real Estate Investment Trust's (REIT's) stock returns and top management changes. The results indicate an inverse relationship between the probability of a management change and a REIT's recent stock price performance. This is consistent with internal monitoring of management activities by the board of directors, other top managers, or large block shareholders. Copyright (c) 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research on the determinants and effects of various governance mechanisms typically assumes that these mechanisms operate independently. However, since a variety of mechanisms are used to achieve alignment of the interests of shareholders and managers, we propose that the level of a particular mechanism should be influenced by the levels of other mechanisms which simultaneously operate in the firm. We examine the substitution effects between alternative internal governance mechanisms for a sample of 81 bank holding companies in the postderegulation period. Specifically, we consider the relationship between monitoring by outside directors and the following mechanisms: monitoring by large outside shareholders, mutual monitoring by inside directors, and incentive effects of shareholdings by managers. Our results provide evidence consistent with the substitution hypothesis. We examine the implications of our findings for future research in the area of corporate governance.

This paper aims to shed light on the relationship between the quality of the individuals on a firm' s board of directors and performance. It reports the results of an empirical study of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms. The findings suggest that quality boards, as measured by the average number of board seats held by each director, are associated with quality firms, as measured by both accounting and market performance.

I present evidence consistent with theories that small boards of directors are more effective. Using Tobin's Q as an approximation of market valuation, I find an inverse association between board size and firm value in a sample of 452 large U.S. industrial corporations between 1984 and 1991. The result is robust to numerous controls for company size, industry membership, inside stock ownership, growth opportunities, and alternative corporate governance structures. Companies with small boards also exhibit more favorable values for financial ratios, and provide stronger CEO performance incentives from compensation and the threat of dismissal.

This study empirically tests the prediction that the inclusion of larger proportions of outside members on the board of directors significantly reduces the likelihood of financial statement fraud. Results from logit regression analysis of 75 fraud and 75 no-fraud firms indicate that no-fraud firms have boards with significantly higher percentages of outside members than fraud firms; however, the presence of an audit committee does not significantly affect the likelihood of financial statement fraud. Additionally, as outside director ownership in the firm and outside director tenure on the board increase, and as the number of outside directorships in other firms held by outside directors decreases, the likelihood of financial statement fraud decreases.

Conceptualization and research have addressed the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of top management teams and, independently, the effectiveness of alternative corporate governance structures. Those studies which do concurrently consider directors and management focus largely on the board's monitoring of the CEO. The interdependencies which exist among chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors necessitate an integrative approach which simultaneously considers these groups of strategic leaders. In this paper, we provide a rationale whereby a firm might elect a CEO or board dominance structure as compared to more balanced governance structures. We suggest that the efficacy of such choices may depend on several attendant conditions including the portfolio exposure and globalization of the firm, its ownership patterns (e.g., five percent owners, institutional investors, positions held by other corporations), and resource dependence and information requirements.

We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the post-restructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.

Transaction cost economics has done much to illuminate the working of corporate governance devices, and we have seen a revival of interest in corporate law and corporate governance since the 1980s, as researchers applied the tools of the new institutional economics and modern corporate finance to analyze the new transactions emerging in the 1980s takeover wave. This article focuses on three mechanisms of corporate governance, to illustrate the analytical usefulness of transaction cost economics for corporate law. It begins with the role of the board of directors, the principal governance structure for shareholders in diffusely held firms, for which Oliver Williamson provided the key conceptualization. It then extends that analysis to a form of block ownership known as relational investing, in which a large shareholder is more actively involved infirm management than is ordinarily expected of non-management shareholders. It concludes with an examination of the choice of law governing shareholder-manager relations, referred to in the literature as state competition for corporate charters, and how Williamson's framework can be fruitfully deployed for understanding the success of US corporate law. Each of the three sections sketches first the theory of the corporate governance mechanism from the perspective of transaction cost economics and then addresses the question whether corporate governance masters by discussing the empirical evidence on whether the mechanism is effective. In addition to limning Williamson's contribution, the objective is to relate theory and data, to ascertain where we are, 20 years after Williamson's fundamental contribution was first articulated in Markets and Hierarchies, and over a decade after the corporate law applications were first explicitly worked out.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationships between the governance structure of a firm and its choice of corporate strategy. Using a sample of 102 corporate takeovers, it finds that the probability of engaging in a diversification program decreases when the board of directors is dominated by outsiders, but it increases when the CEO is also the chairperson of the board. In addition, it finds that the gains to the shareholders of the acquiring firm are smaller when the CEO is also the chairperson of the board. (c) 1996, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

A team of American economists headed by an authority on the transition economies of Eastern Europe presents findings from 18 case studies of industrial enterprises in the Czech Republic (N=6), Hungary (N=5), and Poland (N=7). Discussing such problems of corporate governance as managerial leeway in formulating policy and owners' ability to dislodge incumbent managers who underperform, the authors compare foreign-owned firms with firms that are domestically owned. The case write-ups represent analytical summaries of extensive interviews involving members of management teams, of Supervisory Boards, as well as of Boards of Directors. Included in the analysis are pertinent laws that govern ownership.

We examine the role of the target firm's independent outside directors during takeover attempts by tender offer. We find that when the target's board is independent, the initial tender offer premium, the bid premium revision, and the target shareholder gains over the entire tender offer period are higher, and that the presence of a poison pill and takeover resistance lead to greater premiums and shareholder gains. We conclude that independent outside directors enhance target shareholder gains from tender offers, and that boards with a majority of independent directors are more likely to use resistance strategies to enhance shareholder wealth.

We investigate whether inside managers are added to corporate boards for efficiency or entrenchment purposes. Our examination of inside director appointments finds that the stock-market reaction to the announcement is significantly negative when inside directors own less than 5% of the firm's common stock, significantly positive when their ownership level is between 5% and 25%, and insignificantly different from zero when ownership exceeds 25%. These results suggest that the expected benefits of an inside director's expert knowledge clearly outweigh the expected costs of managerial entrenchment only when managerial and outside shareholder interests are closely aligned.

We examine the relation among the stock returns of successful bidders in bank acquisitions, the composition of the boards of directors, and directors' stock ownership. We find that abnormal returns are negatively related to the proportion of outside directors, but positively related to the number of other outside directorships held by independent outsiders. Abnormal returns are positively related to the proportion of ownership by outside directors, but are associated only with high levels of inside ownership. These results support the notions that the governance structure of banking firms is significantly different from that of nonfinancial firms, and that empirical findings on internal control mechanisms cannot be generalized from nonfinancial firms to banks.

Unique factors in commercial banks' legal and regulatory environment may influence their mechanisms of corporate control. I investigate this issue in a sample of U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) by analyzing how many underwent a change in corporate control by hostile takeover, friendly merger, management turnover by the board, or intervention by regulators. I compare the relative importance of these methods with those in nonfinancial firms. 1 relate the use of these methods to BHC board and ownership structure and performance. I find that the most important corporate control mechanism in banks is regulatory intervention, and that the primary market-based corporate control mechanism is action by the board of directors. Overall, however, BHC boards are much less assertive than their counterparts at nonfinancial firms. I examine reasons for this.

This paper discusses a model that combines internal and external control mechanisms in a firm in which assets can have alternative uses that are in some states more profitable than the current one. However, restructuring a firm in order to realize the gains from alternative uses affects managers adversely since they invest in firm-specific human capital. Managers can be motivated to restructure the firm through their compensation scheme. Alternatively, investors can acquire costly information on the firm and interfere with managers' decisions. The main focus is on independent directors, who review and monitor contracts and managers' compensation. If information is not too costly, directors are the optimal institution to check managerial discretion and the degree of managerial entrenchment depends on the compensation of independent directors. However, if directors fail to exercise control over management properly, takeovers or creditor control become second-best solutions. If information is costly to transfer, unchecked managerial control may be optimal.

This study examines the board of directors in 190 publicly traded bank holding companies and finds that board composition reflects the ownership structure of the firm. Outside director board membership is greater when insititutional investors and independent outside directors own a substantial share of a firm's equity. Outside director board membership is lower when the CEO owns more of a firm's equity. This suggests that outside investors gain control over internal control mechanisms as their share of equity increases but have less control when the CEO owns more of a firm's equity.

Critics of corporate governance have suggested that improvements in board monitoring will arise from more independent boards consisting of outside directors and from increased stock ownership by directors. Presumably these changes should result in more rational, more defensible compensation decisions in which pay is clearly tied to results. In this paper, we test the premise that boards with a relatively higher proportion of outsiders and boards with significant shareholdings maintain a closer link between corporate performance and executive pay than do boards with fewer outsiders and boards holding little stock. The results of the study, based on a sample of 268 large corporations, are mixed. As expected, boards with significant shareholdings maintain a stronger linkage between compensation and firm-level performance. This finding persists even after controls are included for CEO and outsider shareholdings. Contrary to expectations, however, evidence was not found that firms with a higher proportion of outsiders on the board of directors relate compensation more strongly to firm results.

This paper examines stock price reactions to announcements of dual-class recapitalizations as they relate to characteristics of the board of directors. Our results show that certain board characteristics provide insight into directors' incentives. We differentiate characteristics of the board that are associated with management attempts to entrench its position and characteristics that may indicate an attempt to improve performance of the firm in the event of a takeover. We find that high levels of insider and affiliated outsider stock ownership, board tenure, and the presence of staggered board elections affect the stock market's reaction to these plans.

This paper examines whether golden parachute adoptions in the banking industry during the eighties aligned the interests of CEOs with those of regulators and or shareholders. Our results provide evidence supporting concerns expressed by regulators: that boards of directors behaved opportunistically by adopting golden parachutes prior to large bank failures in order to exploit the FDIC guarantee. Parachute adoption was correlated with poor performance ex ante and ex post. Moreover, adoption of parachutes virtually ceased when the FDIC guarantee was withdrawn by FDICIA.

How can boards be chosen through a process partially controlled by the CEO, yet, in many instances, still be effective monitors of him? We offer an answer based on a model in which board effectiveness is a function of its independence. This, in turn, is a function of negotiations (implicit or explicit) between existing directors and the CEO over who will fill vacancies on the board. The CEO's bargaining power over the board-selection process comes from his perceived ability relative to potential successors. Many empirical findings about board structure and performance arise as equilibrium phenomena of this model.

This paper surveys the empirical and theoretical literature on the mechanisms of corporate governance. We focus on the internal mechanisms of corporate governance (e.g., corporate board of directors) and their role in ameliorating various classes of agency problems arising from conflicts of interests between managers and equityholders, equityholders and creditors, and capital contributors and other stakeholders to the corporate firm. We also examine the substitution effect between internal mechanisms of corporate governance and external mechanisms, particularly markets for corporate control. Directions for future research are provided.

The results of this research demonstrate that boards of directors in venture-capital backed companies are more involved in both strategy formation and evaluation than are boards where members do not have large ownership stakes. These same results are demonstrated even when industry, board size, level of diversification, and insider board representation are held constant. Agency theory and institutional theory are advanced as reasons for this higher level of involvement. Venture capitalists are generally seen as value-added investors who have played a significant role in the development of many entrepreneurial businesses (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This success has lead students of industrial competitiveness like Thurow (1992) to argue that the venture capitalist should serve as an example for directors of all types of organizations. One of the most significant value-added activities of the venture capitalist is involvement with strategy (Fried and Hisrich 1995; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Sapienza 1989, Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, and Taylor 1993). Implicit in the writings extolling directors who act like venture capitalists (Porter 1992a, 1992b; Bhide 1994; Thurow 1992) is the belief that they will be more active than traditional board members. However, little empirical work has been done to directly compare the level of strategic involvement of the two types of boards. Building on the work of Judge and Zeithaml (1992), this study compares the level of board involvement with strategy by the boards of venture capital-backed companies with the boards of other types of organizations. After establishing different levels of involvement, it then examines why there is a difference. Finally, this study provides additional empirical evidence on the relationship between board involvement and performance (Zahra and Pearce 1989). (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

A system of corporate governance requires that a board of directors be accountable, while allowing the board to create wealth for the shareholders of the company. While recognising these twin objectives of a system of good corporate governance, the Cadbury Report's recommendations were directed towards issues of control and accountability. This has led to accusations that the emphasis on corporate accountability risks damaging the spirit of enterprise necessary for commercial and economic success. Given that the discussion concerning accountability and enterprise to date has been to a large degree anecdotal, the purpose of this paper is to offer a thorough review of the available evidence and arguments. In particular, the paper considers whether the present system of corporate governance operating in the UK, with its emphasis on market solutions and monitoring by non-executive directors, allows the goals of accountability and enterprise to be jointly achieved. The paper concludes that a far greater understanding of the links between governance mechanisms and their effects on accountability and enterprise is required, in order to ensure that measures to increase accountability do not have unforeseen effects on the enterprise activities of the corporation.

Many shareholders and academics oppose the corporate practice of having the same officer serve both as CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Critics of this corporate practice argue that boards are unlikely to monitor and discipline top management if CEOs themselves serve as board chairmen. This lack of monitoring, it is alleged, will lead to inefficiency in corporate investment decisions and wealth loss for stockholders. We test this hypothesis within the context of corporate takeover decisions and find that dual office holding has no effect on the gains to bidding firms in takeovers. A possible explanation as to why dual office holding may not be harmful may lie in the specific corporate governance attributes of these firms: dual office holding in a firm is associated with a higher probability of outside directors being in majority, thus ensuring close monitoring of the dual office holders.

This paper examines the effect of variables related to management incentives, corporate governance, and performance on the likelihood a bank is acquired. We find that banks with higher levels of management ownership are less likely to be acquired, particularly in acquisitions where target managers depart from their jobs following the acquisition. We document high rates of management turnover following bank acquisitions. This evidence is consistent with an entrenchment hypothesis, where management teams block attempts to be acquired. We find little evidence that any other incentive, governance, or performance variables are systematically related to the probability a bank is acquired. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Since merger and acquisition activity does not unambiguously benefit the shareholders of acquiring firms, the motivation of managers who undertake such actions is unclear. The present study investigates the extent to which the wealth effects of acquisition activity undertaken by firms in one industry-communications and publishing-are related to (1) the ownership and wealth characteristics of both the executives and the board of directors of these firms and (2) the ownership concentration of large outside shareholders. The motivating hypothesis, supported by empirical results, is that these factors contribute to the alignment of executive and shareholder interests.

We examine whether New Zealand firms changed the composition of their boards of directors due to the 1994 enactment of the new Companies Act. We explore two possible effects. First, outside directors may have been more attractive, and firms may have used more outside directors after the new Companies Act. Alternatively, the new duties and associated penalties could have made outside directorships less attractive and harder to fill, and firms may have used less outside directors. Our results show that the proportion of outside directors increased by about 5% after the new Companies Act. This supports the view that the value of outside directors increased after the Act and suggests that the political process can change corporate governance mechanisms.

This study investigates voluntary demand for auditing by family businesses, a sig-nificant but relatively unexplored segment of the economy. The paper considers demand for both internal and external auditing by using survey data to investigate the impact of firm characteristics linked to the cost vs. benefit of engaging an auditor. Variables examined are firm size, debt, and two agency proxies that measure separa-tion of ownership and control, namely, the proportion of nonfamily management in the firm, and the proportion of nonfamily representation on the board of directors. The paper also considers the association between internal and external auditing. Descriptive results on voluntary demand for auditing by 186 family businesses revealed that internal audit was more prevalent than external audit, and outsourcing was a common method for providing internal audit. Results from logistic regression analyses provide support for the hypothesized impact of the two agency proxies and firm debt on demand for external audit, but do not explain the demand for internal audit. For firms that voluntarily engaged an auditor (internal and/or external audit), the negative and significant correlation between internal and external audit suggest that in the family business environment they are more commonly viewed as substitute rather than complementary responses.

This paper builds a model of the effects of agency risk and procedural justice in the boards of directors of venture capital-backed firms. Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Optimal ownership structure is an important issue in corporate governance debates. This study uses piece-wise regression analysis to examine the impact of ownership structure on the risk of CEO compensation. We show that when the CEO and the board of directors control low levels of voting stock (i.e., below 13% of total shares) increases in ownership are positively related to CEO compensation risk. For ownership levels above 13% but below 22%, increases in ownership are negatively related to CEO compensation risk. This evidence provides a partial explanation for the non-monotonic relationship between Tobin's Q and management ownership observed by Morck et al. (1988) [Morck, R., Shleifer, A., Vishny, R., 1988.

Managing the succession process by the hiring and firing of key executives is one of the important functions of a board of directors. In this research we study successions of fund managers in the closed-end mutual fund industry. The agency issues inherent in closed-end mutual funds makes them a unique laboratory for such a study. Our results suggest that while the overall abnormal returns of these manager changes are statistically insignificant, that the returns are more positive for funds with large expense ratios and for funds trading at a discount. We also find the abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of inside director stock ownership. Corporate bond funds and international equity funds react more negatively to these announcements than other types of funds. The abnormal returns do not appear to be related to board composition, but board composition does vary across fund type, and may therefore indirectly influence the results.

In this paper, the field of corporate governance in the US from the perspective of financial economists is reviewed. It begins with a discussion of the fundamental agency problem from which that field emanates, which is the separation between the owners (the shareholders) and the controllers (the managers) of the modern public corporation. Relying primarily on survey papers, the current evidence on the various mechanisms that have been proposed as potential solutions to this agency problem is then reviewed. The contributions made by the other three papers that comprise this Special Issue on Corporate Governance are also highlighted. Finally, suggestions-my own and those of others-regarding the direction of future corporate governance research are offered. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This study empirically examines the relation between certain board of director characteristics and the extent that audit committee composition voluntarily exceeds minimum mandated levels and includes outside directors with financial reporting and audit committee knowledge and experience. This study focuses on board characteristics because the board directly controls audit committee membership. Such staffing decisions can directly affect the ability of the audit committee to monitor management's financial reporting process on behalf of the board. Results suggest that Canadian firms that voluntarily include more outside directors on the audit committee than the mandated minimum have larger boards with more outsiders serving on those boards and are more likely to segregate the board chairperson position from the CEO/president positions. Additionally, firms that voluntarily create audit committees composed of outsider members with a breadth of relevant financial reporting and audit committee knowledge and experience have boards that are larger, have more outside members, and are less likely to be chaired by the CEO/president. Implications of these findings for auditors, institutional investors, regulators, and other interested parties are discussed.

Relationships between corporate governance characteristics and financial distress status are examined for a sample of Canadian firms. Results from logit regression analysis of 46 financially distressed and 46 healthy firms lead us to conclude that the board of director's composition explains financial distress, beyond an exclusive reliance on financial indicators. Additionally, supplemental results indicate that outside directors' ownership and directorship affect the likelihood of financial distress. Furthermore, splitting financially distressed firms based on chief executive officer change as a proxy of turnaround strategies provides useful insights on corporate governance characteristics in financial distress.

The aim of this paper is to explore the efficacy of monitoring by the board of directors, and especially independent outside directors, in New Zealand. The Companies and Financial Reporting Acts of 1993 provide a unique opportunity to examine if legislation directly designed to increase the fiduciary responsibility of the board had a discernible impact on the relationship between independent outside board representation and firm performance. We find that the effects of the Companies Act and related legislation are relatively benign in so far as influencing the relationship between firm performance and outside board representation is concerned. The legislation did not seem to enhance or weaken the positive relationship between outside board representation and firm performance. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

While many aspects of stock and option based compensation for corporate officers remain controversial, we suggest that the growing trend for similar practices in favor of boards of directors will prove to be even more contentious. High-ranking corporate managers do not set their own salaries nor authorize their own stock options. By contrast, boards of directors do, in fact, set their own compensation packages. Other potential conflicts of interest include setting option performance targets, stock buybacks, stock option resets and reloads, consolidations (mergers and acquisitions), and service on multiple boards. As trust is the most valuable commodity in a capitalist society, we suggest that these potential conflicts of interest and related outcomes may ultimately serve to erode any anticipated benefits of director stock compensation.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

The empirical relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, the investment opportunity set (IOS) and corporate governance mechanisms is analyzed for a sample of 415 Canadian firms in 1997. Results indicate that firms with high IOS pay higher levels of total compensation to their CEOs. In addition, CEOs of high IOS derive a larger proportion of their compensation from performance-contingent forms of pay such as bonuses, stock option grants and long-term incentive plans. However, CEOs with weak boards of directors are compensated more than CEOs with powerful boards. Contrary to our expectation, we find that in high IOS firms with weak boards of directors, CEOs seek to have higher proportions of contingent forms of pay in their compensation. An implication of this result is that contingent compensation practices may be a more value-enhancing form of remuneration for CEOs. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

This study examines whether audit committee and board characteristics are related to earnings management by the firm. A negative relation is found between audit committee independence and abnormal accruals. A negative relation is also found between board independence and abnormal accruals. Reductions in board or audit committee independence are accompanied by large increases in abnormal accruals. The most pronounced effects occur when either the board or the audit committee is comprised of a minority of outside directors. These results suggest that boards structured to be more independent of the CEO are more effective in monitoring the corporate financial accounting process. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We examine, both theoretically and empirically, top-management compensation in the presence of agency conflicts when shareholders have delegated governance responsibilities to a self-interested Board of Directors (BOD). We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.

In this paper we examine whether regulation can be used to substitute for internal monitoring mechanisms (percentage of outside directors, officer and director common stock ownership, and CEO/Chair duality) to control for agency conflicts in a firm. We find that, in general, the percentage of outside directors is negatively related to insider stock ownership, but is not affected by CEO/Chair duality. CEO/Chair duality is, however, less likely when insider stock ownership increases. We find these internal monitoring mechanisms to be significantly less related with regulated firms (banks and utilities). We conclude that to the extent that regulations reduce the impact of managerial decisions on shareholder wealth, effective internal monitoring of managers becomes less important in controlling agency conflicts.

This paper provides a critical comparative analysis of corporate governance mechanisms in market-oriented (Anglo-Saxon) and large shareholder-oriented (Continental European) systems of corporate governance. Deficiencies in shareholder protection in the legal systems of both corporate governance systems have been addressed through the use of codes of good governance, a set of norms that regulate the behaviour and structure of the board of directors. However, the lower enforceability of norms in Continental Europe limits the applicability of such codes. Therefore, we argue that in Continental Europe, rather than promoting codes of good governance, it is necessary to expand market control mechanisms to facilitate the maximisation of firm value.

This paper models the composition of New Zealand boards of directors as a function of alternative corporate governance mechanisms, other control variables, and legislation designed to improve corporate monitoring. We find evidence that board composition and firm performance jointly impact each other in a positive manner. We document that the proportion of outsiders on the board is positively related to board size and is negatively related to future growth, nonlinearly related to inside ownership, and is not related to debt and ownership concentration. Firm performance is inversely related to firm size, positively impacted by future growth, and appears to be nonlinearly related to insider ownership. Passage of the new Companies Act in 1994 is associated with increased representation of outside board members. However, this increase is not associated with enhanced firm performance which may be a consequence of increased liability placed on directors. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We study the long-term stock performance of initial public offerings (IPOs). We examine how past performance affects the board of directors' stability and how changes in boards affect subsequent performance. We introduce a dynamic, scale invariant stability metric to measure such changes. Our results indicate that among IPO firms, those with poorer initial performance experience greater board instability and that greater board stability is associated with improvement in subsequent performance. These results indicate that board members leave poorly performing firms, rather than shareholders replacing ineffective boards. Retaining boards that experience initial good performance is associated with continued success.

Boards of directors often implement long-term performance plans (LTPP) to focus management's attention on enhancing long-term shareholder value instead of concentrating their efforts on short-term earnings. This study provides estimation results suggesting that firms that compensate managers with LTPP are associated with lower levels of managed earnings than firms that have only short-term bonus plans. In addition, we find evidence that suggests that firms with long-term performance plans have significantly higher annual returns than firms that have only short-term bonus plans. We also find that firms with long-term performance plans are typically larger firms with smaller managerial ownership and larger institutional ownership than firms without long-term performance plans.

Compares two corporate governance models: the Anglo-American and the Continental European model. These corporate governance models differ strongly, and the differences are mainly due to differences in the business context. The problems arising from separation of ownership from control will thus have to be solved through different mechanisms. One important mechanism is the board of directors. The board composition of 122 companies has been analyzed in a Belgian empirical study. From the tests, finds a significant positive relationship between the number of directors in the board and a range of other factors. Shareholder structure does not seem to have an effect on the size of the board. A second variable concerning the composition of the board, is the percentage of external directors. Finds that the number of external directors differs significantly between companies with a different nationality and between companies that are listed or not. Size, shareholder structure and industry were not related to the percentage of external directors in a company. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

While critical accounting research has long been vitally interested in relationships between accounting, auditing and control of business organizations, mainstream research in accounting, finance and management has only recently displayed an increased interest in questions of corporate governance. The notion of corporate governance typically employed in mainstream research focus on enhancing benefits to shareholders. The structure and the functioning of boards of directors, and audit committees of such boards, are primary concerns within this line of research. This paper presents an alternative view of corporate governance and the role of auditing within corporate governance. We argue that the role of auditing should be increased in order to enhance the control of corporations for the benefit of all stakeholders and society generally. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We examine the effect of deregulation in the 1970s and 1980s on the size of the board of directors, its composition, and on CEO tenure. Using panel data techniques, we consider those effects in the aggregate and for individual industries while controlling for firm size, CEO age, time and firm-specific effects. We conclude that deregulation significantly reduced the number of outsiders and the number of directors, but had little effect on the proportion of outsiders. We then examine the effect of deregulation on CEO tenure using hazard analysis. We find that deregulation increased the hazard rate, or reduced the tenure of CEOs.

This study focused on analysing the effect of acquisition characteristics on post-acquisition operating performance for 83 bids consisting of 83 public listed bidders acquiring 80 private, 2 public listed and 1 non-public listed targets in Malaysia during the period 1988-1992. The specific bid characteristics analysed are business relatedness, management turnover, the relative size of targets to bidders, the method of payment offered and board of directors' ownership structure. Since the specific feature of the current sample is that it consists mainly of privately owned targets, the characteristics of disciplinary bids found in acquisitions of public listed targets were not expected in agreed bids between the bidders and targets in this study. The results indicate that the target directors' turnover and the directors' share ownership do not have a significant effect on the post-acquisition performance. Rather it appears that, if anything, retention of existing management is more likely to lead to performance improvement. Further analysis shows that replacement of target management has no impact on post-acquisition performance regardless of the relatedness line of business. The latter findings reinforce the unique characteristics of the data set used in the current analysis of acquisitions of privately owned Malaysian companies in which unique skills of previous directors may often be retained post-acquisition regardless of the business relatedness. The study also provides evidence that acquisitions of highly related business between target and acquiring firm, large relative size of target to bidders and payment for the acquisition by shares have a significant positive impact on post-acquisition control-adjusted performance. However, highly related business between target and bidder and payment by shares are the only significant acquisition characteristics that have a significant positive impact on the post-acquisition control-adjusted performance when multiple regression is used.

This study examines the relationship between board diversity and firm value for Fortune 1000 firms. Board diversity is defined as the percentage of women, African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics on the board of directors. This research is important because it presents the first empirical evidence examining whether board diversity is associated with improved financial value. After controlling for size, industry, and other corporate governance measures, we find significant positive relationships between the fraction of women or minorities on the board and firm value. We also find that the proportion of women and minorities on boards increases with firm size and board size, but decreases as the number of insiders increases. (c) 2003 Eastern Finance Association.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

In this paper, we extend the work of Ang et al. [J. Finance 55 (1999) 81] to large firms. We find that managerial ownership is positively related to asset utilization but does not serve as a significant deterrent to excessive discretionary expenses. Outside block ownership may only have a limited effect on reducing agency costs. Furthermore, smaller boards serve the same role, but independent outsiders on a board do not appear to protect the firm from agency costs. Thus, this paper reports complementary evidence to Ang, Cole and Lin. In large publicly traded corporations, managerial ownership significantly alleviates principal-agent conflicts even in the presence of other agency deterrent mechanisms.

We examined the roles of institutional investors, boards of directors, and technological opportunity in relation to international diversification. Our research contributes to both agency and foreign direct investment theories. In data on 197 large U.S. firms, we found significant relationships between institutional ownership and international diversification. International diversification was favored by (1) professional investment funds along with outside board members and (2) pension funds along with inside board members. Also, pension funds' long-term orientation facilitated internationalization in industries with high technological opportunities. The results suggest that different institutional owners have different stakes in firms' international strategies, and the effects of boards of directors and technological opportunity accentuate these differences.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors and their monitoring committees (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the full board and its monitoring committees, and a greater proportion of independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the full board. Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on full board and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that full board independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture. (c) 2003 Wiley. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the linkage between the use of outside directors and managerial ownership. We conjecture there are two linkages: The standard incentive-alignment demand for monitoring when managers own little stock and an entrenchment-amelioration demand when managerial stock ownership is high. As a consequence, we predict the association between managerial ownership and board composition will be nonlinear (U-shaped if the entrenchment effect is sufficiently pronounced). Using UK data, we find that both quadratic and logarithmic models outperform the simple linear relationship assumed in prior research and that the substitution between managerial ownership and board composition is stronger than hitherto supposed.

In this paper we present empirical evidence on the attitudes of Taiwanese company directors on the role and function of the board of directors in Taiwanese corporate governance. Our findings arise from a questionnaire survey distributed to the directors of a sample of companies listed on the Taiwanese Securities Exchange (TSE). Our findings provide a picture of the current state of corporate governance in Taiwan. The respondents indicate that the board of directors constitutes the most important instrument in Taiwanese corporate governance and our findings endorse the important role played by outside directors in the corporate governance system in Taiwan. Furthermore, the respondents endorsed the agency theory perspective on corporate governance as they considered the presence of outside directors improved corporate accountability to shareholders. There is, however, evidence that few companies have created remuneration and audit committees. We also found that Taiwanese directors are dissatisfied with the influence of families on the corporate governance of listed companies and do not consider that outside directors on boards should be related to founding families. Overall, the directors displayed an awareness of accountability issues and a desire to improve accountability and transparency. They clearly want international harmonisation of corporate governance standards and view corporate governance reform as a means of attracting foreign funds into Taiwan. This is an important finding as it endorses the work of the OECD and other international bodies in harmonising corporate governance at a global level.

A major criticism of corporate boards of directors is the absence of objectivity in appraising and monitoring management [The Business Lawyer, 48 (1992) 59-77]. Recently, Shivdasani and Yermack [Journal of Finance LIV (5) (1999) 1829] find that CEO involvement in board selection is associated with a greater proportion of gray and a lower proportion of outside director appointments. The question addressed here is whether corporate performance, as measured by Tobin's q, is affected by management influence in the board nominating process. Agrawal and Knoeber [Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 31 (3) (1996) 377] find interdependence among seven mechanisms to control agency problems between managers and stockholders. Their finding suggests that cross-sectional OLS regressions of firm performance on a single mechanism may be misleading and that interpretation of multiple regression methods is weakened by multicollinearity. In this study, a principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to mitigate such problems. An index of management involvement in director nomination is constructed for a sample of 106 firms from 1989 to 1992 via a PCA method utilizing selected governance mechanisms within the nominating process. We find a positive relationship between management participation in the director selection process and corporate performance. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigate the relationship between institutional shareholdings and the firm's corporate governance by looking at changes in the composition of the board of directors and audit committee while institutional ownership increases over time. Our comparison of 74 firms showing increased institutional ownership with a matched control group of 62 firms finds that increased institutional ownership is positively associated with a higher proportion of outsiders on the board and with audit committee and board members who are less entrenched. These factors are widely regarded as signs of a strengthened system of corporate governance and control, underscoring the important role that institutional ownership may play in the firm's corporate governance structure.

This paper examines two recent trends relative to boards of directors' compensation, and their potential incompatibility. There has been some progress in increasing board diversity, specifically the inclusion of women and minorities on boards. The increasing trend requiring directors to hold/purchase equity as a requirement of board membership may seriously compromise further improvements in diversifying boards. Also, an increasing number of companies compensate directors partially or fully in stock grants and options. These compensation policies may be exclusionary, especially for women and minorities, impacting the quality of boardroom discussions and decisions. This study systematically examines whether corporations requiring director equity are exclusionary toward women and minority directors. Contrary to being exclusionary, companies with director stock requirements and annual stock awards have greater representation by women and minorities on their board. Moreover, larger companies are both more likely to have such policies and have higher proportions of women and minorities on the board.

The control role of the Board of Directors is aimed at monitoring the decisions and actions undertaken by managers in order to protect stockholders' interests. Considerable theoretical and empirical research has analyzed whether directors' behavior is consistent with their fiduciary responsibility, but this research has reported inconsistent findings. This paper offers a comprehensive review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the control role of the board and suggests several guidelines for future research. (c) 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Most of studies on corporate governance are based on the Anglo-Saxon view. However in France the majority of the top managers graduate from Ena and Polytechnic. Belonging to one or the other of these two clans, with the underlying link to the civil service, can have serious repercussions on the system of corporate governance. The clan tries to increase their power in the firms. In order to do this, it needs to control firms' leaders, but also the board of directors. The control of the board allows the system to master all shareholders' objections. It is also a means to widen its influence. This study proposes an analysis of the links between the characteristics of leaders and boards as well as the consequences of this control of the clan on the performance of the firm.

Creditor reliance on accounting-based debt covenants suggests that debtors are potentially concerned with board of director characteristics that influence the integrity of financial accounting reports. In a sample of S&P 500 firms, we find that the cost of debt is inversely related to board independence and board size. We also find that fully independent audit committees are associated with a significantly lower cost of debt financing. Similarly, yield spreads are also negatively related to audit committee size and meeting frequency. Overall, these results provide market-based evidence that boards and audit committees are important elements affecting the reliability of financial reports. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the mechanisms underlying the worldwide diffusion of organizational practices. We suggest that the two main theoretical explanations in the diffusion literature, efficiency and legitimation, can be complementary. More specifically, we argue that endogenous forces seek to enhance the efficiency of existing systems, while exogenous forces seek to increase legitimation. To assess our argument, we explore the worldwide diffusion of codes of good governance. These codes are a set of 'best practice' recommendations regarding the behavior and structure of a firm's board of directors issued to compensate for deficiencies in a country's corporate governance system regarding the protection of shareholders' rights. We have collected data on codes of good governance for 49 countries. We operationalize efficiency needs in terms of the characteristics of shareholder protection, and legitimation pressures in terms of government liberalization, economic openness, and presence of foreign institutional investors. Our analysis supports the argument that both efficiency needs and legitimation pressures lead to code adoption. In addition, our empirical results show that countries with legal systems with strong shareholder protection rights tend to be more prone to develop codes, possibly for efficiency reasons. This article contributes to organization theory by illustrating that the diffusion of codes fosters both cross-national corporate governance convergence as well as some degree of country hybridization, particularly depending on the type of code issuer.

The study reported here examined how various characteristics of the board of directors and other governance features affected the occurrence of U.S. corporate fraud in the 1978-2001 period. The findings suggest that board composition and the structure of a board's oversight committees are significantly correlated with the incidence of corporate fraud. In the sample, as the number of independent outside directors increased on a board and in the board's audit and compensation committees, the likelihood of corporate wrongdoing decreased.

This study investigates the structure of the board of directors at socially responsible (SR) firms. Using a sample of 394 SR firms and comparing these to a matched sample of firms, I find that SR firms have characteristics associated with effective board structures. For instance, SR firms have more outsiders and women directors, and less instance of CEO/Chairman duality than non-SR firms. Results are similar when using a continuous measure of social responsibility. Also, I document that SR firms have higher Governance Index scores than the matched sample. Overall, this suggests that a reason for shareholders' appeal in socially responsible firms and mutual funds may be because these firms have stronger governance mechanisms in place than do non-SR firms. In addition, it appears that effective governance structures are more likely to exist in firms that focus on a broad range of stakeholders, rather than in firms that have a strict focus on shareholder wealth maximization.

Using a simultaneous equations framework with a comprehensive set of publicly listed Swiss companies, our findings suggest that the size of the board of directors is an independent corporate governance mechanism. This implies that any potential relationship between board size and firm valuation is indeed causal. However, in contrast to previous studies, we do not uncover a significant relationship between board size and firm valuation, which can be interpreted as support for the hypothesis of the existence of an optimal board size. On average, firms choose the number of board members just optimally. This indicates that cross-sectional variations in board size to a large extent reflect differences in firms' underlying environment, and not mistaken choices.

Due to the high incidence of fraud in Australia, regulatory reports suggest strengthening the monitoring role of the board of directors (BOD). These reports recommend greater independence and no duality (chairperson of the BOD should not be the CEO) on the BOD. While there is no Australian evidence, research evidence in the U.S. supports these suggested reforms. It is not clear whether the research evidence observed in the U.S. will generalize to the Australian setting because of contextual differences. This study extends the U.S. findings to the Australian context and investigates the relationship between two attributes of the BOD, independence and duality, and fraud. In addition, I examine whether institutional ownership plays a role in the context of fraud. The more highly concentrated institutional ownership in Australia suggests the presence of some relationship. Using a matched sample of fraud and no-fraud firms from 1988-2000, I find that as the percentage of independent directors and the percentage of independent institutional ownership increases, the likelihood of fraud decreases. As expected, the results show a positive relationship between duality and the likelihood of fraud. These results support the call for strengthening the composition and structure of the BOD in Australia.

The influence of corporate governance on firm performance has been discussed for a number of years, but mainly in a United States and European business context. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in large Australian firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance, as measured by return on equity and markct-to-book value ratio. The results showed that outsider ratio and female director ratio were positively associated with firm performance, whereas board size and directors' age had no influence on firm performance.

This paper reports the findings of an investigation, through a series of interviews, into the role of the supervisory board (SB) in Chinese listed companies. The interviews were conducted and analysed using the grounded theory methodology. It is found that the SB performs one of four roles under the Chinese corporate environment: an honoured guest, a friendly advisor, a censored watchdog or an independent watchdog. The role of the SB is dependent on a variety of factors: SB characteristics, power relations between the Board of Directors and the SB, shareholding structure, the influence of the Communist Party of China and government, the role of independent directors and the requirements of the corporate law.

This paper analyses the market reaction to announcements made by Spanish firms of compliance with the code of best practice. It also attempts to determine how the characteristics of different firms may account for the excess returns observed. The results suggest that the market reacts positively to announcements of compliance with the code of best practice that imply a major restructuring of the board of directors, whereas no wealth effects are observed for announcements that relate to isolated recommendations in the code. These wealth effects are greater for lower levered firms, and also greater the higher the percentage of executive directors.

This paper examines the relationship between board characteristics and earnings management. Management of a firm may engage in earnings management for his own benefit. However, under proper corporate governance mechanism, the board of directors might be able to monitor the firm and prevent the management from engaging in earnings management. We find that when the board size is large, the higher the extent of earnings management. However, when there are more outside directors in the board, the extent of earnings management is lower. The effects of board characteristics on earnings management are significant only for group affiliation firms or non-electronic firms.

This paper indicates that there is an inverse relationship between collateralised shares and firm performance. We further show that this inverse relationship exists only in conglomerate firms. These findings imply that agency problems resulting from shares used as collateral by boards of directors are more serious in conglomerate firms than in non-conglomerate firms. Moreover, we provide evidence that monitoring by institutional investors, creditors and dividend policy can effectively reduce the agency problems of shares used as collateral and thus can improve firm performance.

Recent research focuses on explaining the diversification discount. However, there is little direct evidence regarding the relation among ownership structure, corporate governance, and corporate diversification. The results in this paper suggest that agency issues do not account for firms adopting a particular diversification strategy. Also, the performance consequences of the shift in the diversification strategy and the subsequent changes in institutional and block ownership structures are not related to agency issues. In fact, investors seem not to avoid diversified firms per se. We suggest that observed board and ownership differences between diversified and focused firms are due to their being at different stages of corporate evolution. (c) 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This explorative research paper illuminates the governance systems in Spanish family businesses, and evaluates the extent to which they pursue good governance practise both in the business and family areas. Empirical evidence is drawn from a database of 112 sizeable Spanish firms, and the results show the absolute dominance of the leading family in the ownership, control and management of sample firms. Approximately half of the members of the board tend to be insiders and more than two-thirds are family members. It emerges that generational firms (with third generation and beyond owner-managers) exhibit greater similarity in their governance structures to first generation firms than second generation ones; this might be due to the so-called "pruning" which is used as a survival mechanism. Overall, it emerges that family firms have a very low degree of board regulation by formal rules and family governance systems are hardly developed. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

There is growing interest in corporate values but where do they come from? What factors determine corporate values? This paper argues that they are determined by corporate governance in a broad sense of the word. Three governance mechanisms are emphasized: ownership structure, board composition and stakeholder influence. In smaller companies founder-owners often play a pivotal role in shaping corporate value systems that influence companies for years to come. In larger companies that separate ownership and control, managers and boards come to play a powerful role. In both cases repeated interaction with customers, employees and other stakeholders shape corporate values by way of corporate reputation and corporate culture.

One of the main characteristics of French worker cooperatives is the principle of collective entrepreneurship. The aim of this article is to understand how it is applied, and in particular how the board of directors and the managing director work together. To answer this question, an exploratory study focused on ten French worker cooperatives in 1998 and 1999, during which we conducted interviews with their managing directors. The results show that three forms of collective entrepreneurship can be distinguished and that these forms depend on the context and the management of these worker cooperatives. (c) CIRIEC 2004.

This empirical paper investigates the relationship between the corporate governance structure of the firm and the probability of voluntary accounting changes in the Netherlands during the period 1990-1998. The paper reports the results of a sample of 194 voluntary accounting changes. The empirical results show that the presence of large outside shareholders significantly decreases the probability of voluntary accounting changes that have a positive effect on reported net income. This result supports the monitoring hypothesis, which indicates that large outside shareholders will monitor voluntary accounting changes more effectively than small shareholders, and will restrict the opportunistic behaviour of managers bent on increasing reported net income. We find that management shareholdings decrease the probability of voluntary accounting changes. These findings are consistent with the alignment hypothesis, which suggests that managers who hold a stake in the firm will be more aligned with outside shareholders. Agency problems may be reduced through management shareholdings. We find no support for the monitoring role of outside members of the supervisory board. Finally, our results show that firm size affects the probability of negative accounting changes, which may support the political cost hypothesis.

I test empirically the hypothesis that the monitoring role of the board of directors depends on the severity of the agency problems and the amount of information needed to monitor. I show that in high growth firms, where the agency conflicts are low and managers are likely to reveal more information to get advice, boards are more independent but less likely to monitor, while in low growth firms, boards are less likely to be independent, but the relationship between firm value and board independence is strong. Overall, boards become more independent but monitor less as firms' growth opportunities increase, suggesting that managers trade off the amount of information released to the board to get a better advice and to mitigate the monitoring role of the board.

The agency view of corporate governance requires effective monitoring to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal. This paper suggests that conventional proposals to reform corporate governance through legislation, codes of best practice, and the like, are necessary, but underestimate the pressures which reputational intermediaries face from inevitable conflicts of interest and bias. Various strands of the literature on corporate governance, cognitive research and behavioural economics are integrated to shed light on questions regarding the independence of boards of directors and external auditors.

Banking firms face an industry specific set of agency problems. The heavily regulated nature of the industry alters the shareholder/manger relationship. The scope of market discipline in the industry is severely limited due to regulatory oversight. This article surveys the state of the corporate governance literature with an emphasis on reviewing the agency problems unique to the banking industry.

The board of directors is the cornerstone of any effective corporate governance system. A well- structured board can effectively monitor and motivate management of a company for the benefit of the company's shareholders. This paper investigates the relationship between board structure and firm performance using a sample of 490 publicly listed firms in China. The characteristics of board structure we examined include: board size, inside/outside/independent directors, CEO/Chair duality, stock holdings of directors, rewards to directors and aged directors. We find significant relationship between firm performance and three characteristics: the rewards to director, the stock holdings of directors and the existence of independent directors. We also find political influences on the effectiveness of boards. When state ownership is more than 50% (state-dominating), rewards and stock holdings of directors are useful. When state ownership is less than 50% (non-state-dominating), the existence of independent directors comes into effect. In addition, our analyses indicate that state ownership affects firm performance. State ownership is positively related to firm performance in state-dominating groups while negatively related to firm performance in non-state-ownership groups.

We examine the relation between the firm's agency costs and the decision to distribute cash to shareholders by declaring a nonrecurring special dividend or by significantly increasing the firm's regular dividend. The independence of the board of directors, the voting rights of outside blockholders and the presence of antitakeover charter amendments all proxy for the level of agency costs within the firm. We find firms that significantly increase their regular dividend are more likely to have a greater proportion of independent directors on their boards and greater outside blockholdings, and are less likely to adopt antitakeover charter amendments than firms that declare a special dividend. The evidence supports the notion that firms with greater agency costs are more likely to pay a special dividend, whereas firms with lower agency costs are more likely to increase their regular dividend.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This study empirically examines the association between certain director characteristics and the extent of voluntary audit committee disclosure in annual reports. Results suggest that Singapore's publicly traded firms are more likely to voluntarily disclose audit committee related information as: the number of board members increases different individuals occupy the roles of CEO and board chairperson the proportion of independent directors serving on the board increases. Findings, however, fail to show any association between the amount of voluntary audit committee disclosure and the percentage of executive directors' ownership. Documented findings are of interest and benefit to various parties including regulators, corporate governance reformists, and corporate management. For instance, findings imply that a positive by-product of implementing major corporate governance reforms currently championed by corporate governance reformists will be an increase in audit committee disclosures. As a result, there will be less pressure on regulators to develop, introduce, and enforce mandatory audit committee disclosures that may be potentially intrusive to a firm's management.

We investigate the relation of the board of directors and institutional ownership with the properties of management earnings forecasts. We find that firms with more outside directors and greater institutional ownership are more likely to issue a forecast and are inclined to forecast more frequently. In addition, these forecasts tend to be more specific, accurate and less optimistically biased. These results are robust to changes specification, Granger causality tests, and simultaneous equation analyses. The results are similar in the pre-and post-Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) eras. Additional analysis suggests that concentrated institutional ownership is negatively associated with forecast properties. This association is less negative in the post-Reg FD environment, which is consistent with Reg FD reducing the ability of firms to privately communicate information to select audiences.

In emerging markets, the agency conflicts between controlling owners and the minority shareholders are difficult to mitigate through conventional corporate control mechanisms such as boards of directors and takeovers. We examine whether external independent auditors are employed as monitors or as bonding mechanisms, or both, to alleviate the agency problems. Using abroad sample from eight East Asian economies, we document that firms with agency problems embedded in the ownership structures are more likely to employ Big 5 auditors. This relation is evident among firms that raise equity capital frequently. Consistently, firms hiring Big 5 auditors receive smaller share price discounts associated with the agency conflicts. Also, we find that Big 5 auditors take into consideration their clients' agency problems when making audit fee and audit report decisions. Taken together, these results suggest that Big 5 auditors do have a corporate governance role in emerging markets.

This paper investigates the role of a firm's internal governance structure in constraining earnings management. It is hypothesized that the practice of earnings management is systematically related to the strength of internal corporate governance mechanisms, including the board of directors, the audit committee, the internal audit function and the choice of external auditor. Based on a broad cross-sectional sample of 434 listed Australian firms, for the financial year ending in 2000, a majority of non-executive directors on the board and on the audit committee are found to be significantly associated with a lower likelihood of earnings management, as measured by the absolute level of discretionary accruals. The voluntary establishment of an internal audit function and the choice of auditor are not significantly related to a reduction in the level of discretionary accruals. Our additional analysis, using small increases in earnings as a measure of earnings management, also found a negative association between this measure and the existence of an audit committee.

In recent years, the debate about the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms has focused on the activity of the corporate boards of directors. This paper analyses the effect of the size of the board, its composition and internal functioning on firm value in a sample of 450 non-financial companies from ten countries in Western Europe and North America. The econometric method combines uniequational regression analysis with simultaneous equations in order to control for the possibility of board size and composition endogeneity. The results show a negative relationship between firm value and the size of the board of directors. This relation holds when we control for alternative definitions of firm size and for board composition, the board's internal functioning, country effect and industry effect. We find no significant relationship between the composition of the board and the value of the firm. These results are consistent with previous relevant papers and show that companies with oversized boards of directors have poorer performance both in countries where internal mechanisms of governance dominate and in countries where external mechanisms are predominant.

We analyse the relationship between firm value, as measured by Tobin's q, and newly released indices of effective corporate governance for a sample of 263 Canadian firms. The results indicate that corporate governance does matter in Canada. However, not all elements of measured governance are important, and the effects of governance do differ by ownership category. For the entire sample of firms we find no evidence that a total governance index affects firm performance. This is mainly because we find no evidence that board independence, the most heavily-weighted sub-index, has any positive effect on firm performance. Indeed, for family-owned firms we find that the effect is negative. In general, sub-indices measuring effective compensation, disclosure and shareholder rights practices enhance performance and this is true for most ownership types. We also find no evidence that governance practices are endogenous. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

We analyze a sample of 412 publicly listed Hong Kong firms during 1995-1998 in order to answer three questions. Does concentrated family ownership affect firm operating performance and value? Does it affect dividend policy? What is the impact of corporate governance on performance, value, and dividend payouts? Our results do not show a positive relationship between family ownership and return on assets, return on equity or the market-to-book ratio. In addition, we find a negative relationship between CEO duality and performance (where CEO duality is much more likely in family-controlled firms). We also find little relationship between family ownership and dividend policy. Only for small firms there is a significant negative relationship between dividend payouts and family ownership up to 10% of the company's stock and a positive relationship for family ownership between 10 and 35%. Dividend payouts in small firms also show little sensitivity to performance. Finally, the composition of the board of directors (proportion of independent non-executive directors, outsider-dominated board, presence of audit committees) has little impact on firm performance and dividend policy, particularly for small market capitalization firms. Our results for Hong Kong are in line with both Demsetz and Lehn (1985) [Demsetz, H., Lehn, K., 1985. The structure of corporate ownership: causes and consequences. Journal of Political Economy 93, 1155-1177] and Himmelberg et al. (1999) [Himmelberg, C.P., Hubbard, R.G., Palia, D., 1999.

The reciprocal interlocking of chief executive officers is a non-trivial phenomenon: among large companies in 1991, about one company in seven was in a relationship whereby the CEO of one company sat on a second company's board and the second company's CEO sat on the first company's board. We develop hypotheses to distinguish whether this practice furthers the interests of shareholders or the private interests of the CEOs. Using a sample of large companies, we employ a probit model to test these hypotheses. Our empirical findings are that these reciprocal CEO interlocks primarily benefit the CEOs rather than their shareholders. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There has been a considerable literature on the determinants of why firms undertake foreign direct investment (FDI), but very little on whether firms with different governance characteristics are more or less likely to venture overseas. For example, are family-controlled firms more predisposed to FDI than firms, with similar attributes, but different forms of ownership? Does the presence of institutional shareholders suggest a greater propensity to invest abroad? Does the composition of the Board of Directors have an impact? Most extant studies of corporate governance focus on the impact of governance factors on firm performance. However, these performance outcomes are a function of the strategic decisions made by the firms, which suggests it might be useful to consider the relationship between corporate governance factors and particular strategic decisions. One example is the decision to undertake foreign direct investment. The two main strands of IB literature on the determinants of FDI have little or nothing to say about how corporate governance factors might affect the FDI decision. Both internalisation theory and the resource-based view see FDI primarily as a means by which firms can appropriate rents in overseas markets from the exploitation of their idiosyncratic resources and capabilities. This paper extends this literature by investigating the effects of governance factors on the decision to undertake FDI. In particular, we want to assess the impact upon the FDI decision of (a) the extent of family control, (b) the presence of domestic and foreign institutional shareholders, and (c) the composition of the Board of Directors. We investigate these effects using a sample of 228 publicly listed firms in Taiwan, and our results clearly indicate that family control and share ownership by domestic financial institutions in Taiwanese firms are associated with the decision to undertake FDI. We also find that corporate governance impacts in different ways with regard to Taiwanese FDI in China in comparison to Taiwanese FDI in the rest of the world. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper examines the effect of ownership and governance on firm performance. Tracing the post financial crisis experience, 1998-2002, of the Korean commercial bank industry, the paper investigates whether the involvement of foreign investors in the ownership structure had any significant effect on the banks' performance i.e., return and risk measures. Further, it examines the effects of the presence of outside directors, especially directors from foreign countries, in the corporate board structure impacts banks performance. Evidence indicates that the extent of the foreign ownership level, not the mere existence of foreign ownership, has a significant positive association with the bank return and a significant negative association with the bank risk. The number of outside board of directors does not have any significant affect on performance however the presence of a foreign director on that board is significantly associated with bank return and risk. These findings are relatively robust under the different specifications of performance measures. (c) 2005 New York University Salomon Cente.

The board of directors is generally seen as an important internal governance structure. However, the empirical evidence on the board-performance relationship is not conclusive. On the other hand, a growing literature suggests that different control mechanisms, either internal or external to the firm, can interact with each other and affect performance. One such important factor is product market competition. The objective of the study is to investigate further the board-performance relationship taking into consideration the potential effect of market competition. More precisely, the study analyzes the combined effect of boards of directors' characteristics, and market discipline on firm performance. Overall, the results suggest that, competition has a positive and significant impact on firm profitability and productivity. Moreover, this determinant factor creates the conditions for which the board-performance relationship is supported. In other words, for boards to be effective, firms should be exposed to a competitive environment. (c) Blackwcll Publishing Ltd. 2005.

In this study we contribute to the literature by re-examining the effect of control and ownership of controlling shareholder on corporate valuation, and determining which particular mechanism for enhancing voting rights would achieve the negative entrenchment effect. We take Taiwan listed companies, where the ownership concentration structure is similar to that in East Asian countries, as our sample. We find the corporate value is higher when the largest shareholder owns more cash flow rights (ownership), supporting the positive incentive effect. The negative entrenchment effect becomes evident when the largest shareholder's cash flow rights are less than the median. Therefore, if the cash flow rights owned by the largest shareholder are greater than the median, the positive incentive effect will restrain the negative entrenchment effect. In family-controlled companies, the corporate value will conspicuously decrease if the largest shareholder enhances their voting rights through cross-shareholding, deeply participates in management or controls most board of directors.

This study aims at investigating the impact of the roles, structure and process of boards on performance of Turkish companies. Drawing on the data obtained from a sample of 386 mostly small and non-listed stock ownership companies, it was found that the separation of chairman and general manager positions has significant positive impact on firm performance. From the board roles of control, service and resource acquisition, firm performance was found to be positively related only to the level of adoption of resource acquisition role. It was also found that the effectiveness, information access and performance evaluation attributes of boards are positively and significantly associated with firm performance.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This study examines the relation between the likelihood of financial statement fraud and certain corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the new rules of the NYSE and the NASDAQ stock markets. Results based upon a logit regression analysis on a sample of 111 fraud firms and 111 matched no-fraud firms indicate that fraud likelihood is lower when audit committee is comprised solely of independent directors and when audit committee members have smaller number of directorships with other companies. Board of director independence, audit committee expertise and nominating committee independence are not significant variables in reducing fraud likelihood. The study also investigates several other corporate governance variables and finds that fraud likelihood is lower when audit committee has longer tenure and chief executive officer is not chairman of the board. These results highlight two new significant aspects of audit committee: the directorships of its members with other firms and the committee members' tenure. The results have direct implications for further improvement of corporate governance. (c) 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Empirical literature on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different studies in the Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration and the board of directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of managerial controls, in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.

The corporate governance literature is rich with empirical tests of the relation between board composition and firm performance. We consider the effect of board composition on a different measure of performance, the probability a firm will be sued by shareholders. We find firms that are defendants in securities litigation have higher proportions of insiders and of gray directors and have smaller boards than a matched group of firms that are not sued, even when controlling for firm value and industry. The results suggest that boards with higher proportions of outside directors do a better job of monitoring management. (c) 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Corporate governance systems develop as a result of cultural underpinnings, legal structures and different forms of financing business. This paper describes these factors in the US and UK, two examples of strong shareholder ownership patterns of financing, and Germany, a country with a tradition of strong creditor financing. Recommendations are made for best practices in governance. Although enhanced governance mechanisms is a sound goal to pursue, the results may be meaningless unless internal controls are strengthened and top management and the board of directors establish an ethical tone at the top.

This article explores the structure of the Italian capitalist system by focusing on the relationships between financial firms - banks, insurance and holding companies - and industrial companies in Italy during the period 1952-72 through the analysis of the interlocks that existed between them. By an interlock is meant the link created between two firms when an individual belongs to the board of directors of both. The analysis is based on a database - Imita.db - containing data on over 30,000 directors of Italian joint-stock companies for the years 1952, 1960 and 1972. After a descriptive statistical overview of the companies and the directors included in the database, the article develops a network connectivity analysis of the system. This is integrated with a prosopographic study of the big linkers, defined as those directors cumulating the highest number of offices in each benchmark year. The article confirms that Italian capitalism maintained substantial peculiarities in the period investigated. In particular, it argues that interlocks played an important role in guaranteeing the stability of the positions of control of the major private companies and their connections with state-owned enterprises. In 1952 and 1960 the system, centred on the larger electrical companies, showed the highest degree of cohesion. That centre dissolved after nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1962 and was replaced by a less strong and cohesive one, hinged on banks, insurance and the major finance companies.

We provide evidence on the relation between board structure and CEO compensation in public sector corporations in New Zealand. Using a sample of 80 New Zealand public sector companies, we find that similar to private sector studies, CEO compensation is related to board size, whether the CEO sits on the board, and director quality. We also find that a composite measure of board structure is significant. We conclude that, similar to the private sector, board structure is important in constraining CEO pay. Moreover, our results suggest that private sector-style board can be effective in a public sector context. (c) 2005, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

The aim of this paper is to distinguish between different roles of boards of directors in companies and to fit the theoretical debate into a framework for better understanding. A simple framework, constructed from the literature, is used to distinguish between the archetypes of roles from a two-dimensional perspective. The paper includes a preliminary qualitative study of Icelandic companies with the aim of testing the framework and exploring the roles of boards in Iceland. The study shows that boards have various roles or patterns of roles and that the roles can change with change of circumstances. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been the subject of academic research from a variety of perspectives. However, the question of whether and how MNEs differ from local businesses in terms of their corporate governance mechanisms concerning the way they are directed and controlled by the board of directors is still largely unexplored. This question must be answered before researchers, policy makers and managers can identify action areas to improve governance and accountability in MNEs. In this paper, we empirically analyze the structures, systems and effectiveness of evaluation processes relating to the board of directors in MNEs and local companies in Turkey, an emerging country. We identify the significant differences on various key aspects of corporate governance among the groups, explore reasons to explain these differences and draw implications for further study of corporate governance in MNEs. A conceptual model is presented where institutional and organizational factors leading to governance differences are linked to how MNEs configure their boards in a host country setting.

In this paper we analyse the evolution of the direct and ultimate ownership structure of a large sample of UK non-financial listed firms over the last decade. Our data show that while outsider ownership is relatively stable over time, managerial ownership shows a sharp decreasing trend and it is significantly lower in the presence of a large outside controller. Nonetheless, while average shareholding by executives confirms the decreasing trend, the opposite holds for non-executive directors. In addition, while average board size is rather constant in time, the proportion of non-executives is steadily increasing in time. As far as ultimate ownership is concerned, our data show that the existence of complex ownership structures in the UK is far from being negligible. We document that more than 10 per cent of the firms are owned via a complex structure and the degree of divergence between cash flow and control rights for these firms is around 11 per cent at the 10 per cent cut-off. Our data also suggest that the presence of complex structures is decreasing in time at any cut-off level. In addition, we report a decreasing trend over time of "widely held" firms. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of a negative impact of the divergence between cash flow and control rights on firm value.

Purpose - This paper aims to test the impact of corporate governance structure on corporate values. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs factor analysis and three-stage least squares to identify and explain variance in corporate values. Findings - In accordance with the proposed theoretical framework ownership, board and stakeholder structure are found to influence corporate values. When value determinants are taken into account there is no significant relationship between values and profitability. Research limitations/implications - This is a pilot study of 71 Danish firms. Further research needs to address measurement of corporate values and to test hypotheses on larger datasets. Practical implications - One practical implication is that corporate values should be grounded in the company's ownership, board and stakeholder structure. Real changes in corporate values may require real changes in governance structure. Originality/value - The paper tests a new approach to the study of corporate values which connects values to governance. It thereby establishes empirical foundations for current discussions about corporate values. This should be important both to practical work on company missions, values and responsibilities and to academics who search for an operational approach to the study of corporate values.

Cannella and Holcomb ((this volume). In: F. Dansereau & F. J. Yammarino (Eds), Research in multi-level issues (Vol. 4). Oxford, UK: Elsevier Science) are unconvinced that top management teams (TMTs) are the appropriate level of analysis for upper echelons research and are, accordingly, unenthusiastic about the promise of multi-level analysis for research of this type. We agree and discuss (1) the fragility of agency theory as it pertains to TMT research, (2) various issues pertaining to TMT turnover (or lack thereof), (3) paradoxes in practice and theory regarding TMT homogeneity/heterogeneity, (4) the absence of boards of directors in the upper echelons perspective, and (5) the implications of these issues on the theory/conceptualization of TMTs and of the research dedicated to them. We question whether the variables, as currently configured, relied on in this literature are sufficiently developed to adequately test an upper echelons perspective, or to sensibly warrant a multi-level analytical approach.

This paper empirically explores the relationship between the identity and concentration of different block holders and firm value for 89 industrial and service firms listed at the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the period 1998-2001. The paper examines the role of block holders (institutional investors who are not on the board of directors, the institutional investors who are on the board of directors, the ownership of the board of directors, and the financial policy of the firm, such as the capital structure) in controlling the managerial actions which leads, on average, to better firm valuation in the emerging market of Jordan. The paper employs a piecewise regression specification methodology. The results of the piecewise regression analysis indicate a positive and significant relationship between the ownership of securities above 25% by the board of directors, institutional investors on the board of directors, the institutional investors not on the board of directors and firm value. There is no significant relationship between the above-mentioned ownership and firm value for ownership below 25%. The results also indicate a significant and negative relationship between ownership by the CEO below 5% and firm value. Leverage is significantly and positively related to firm value when we relate ownership by institutional investors not on the board of directors and firm value. This might imply that creditors work as complementary monitors of value along with institutional investors who are not on the board of directors. The paper concludes that block holders are important monitors of firm value especially if they own large amounts of securities to justify the high cost of monitoring. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, Information Security Governance has emerged as a new discipline, requiring the attention of Boards of Directors and Executive Management for effective information security. This paper investigates the literature on Corporate Governance, IT Governance and Information Security Governance to identify the components towards a definition of Information Security Governance. The paper concludes by defining Information Security Governance and discussing the definition, identifying and addressing all important issues that need to be taken into account to properly govern information security in an organization.

This paper analyzes the change in the risk of Spanish savings banks after regional regulation have changed the composition of governance mechanism of savings banks. The regional regulation has increased the presence of public administrations in the general assembly and board of directors of savings banks at expense of depositor's representation that was reduced. The results show that this regulation's change have increased the risk of savings banks, specially in those savings banks with a higher representation of the local and regional governments.

This study examines the effects of the Taiwanese modified two-tier board of directors and family control on firm performance. Similar to its German origin, the Taiwanese system separates the monitoring role from the strategic planning role of the board. Using firm-level fixed-effects panel analysis, we find evidence that family-ties between the Taiwanese supervisors and the CEOs have undermined the internal monitoring of the Taiwanese firms. Our results suggest that without majority ownership, family control of the internal monitoring mechanism impedes firm performance. The study has three major implications for the search for a more effective corporate governance structure. (c) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors in the Tunisian context. We model the composition of the board of directors as a function of alternative governance mechanisms, some board characteristics and other control variables. On a sample of 97 Tunisian firms, we find evidence that the proportion of outsiders on the board of directors is positively associated with large block, institutional and overseas ownerships, and board size. We document that the CEO duality is associated with a decrease in the board independence. We fail to find an evidence that increased debt ratio to total assets is inversely associated with the outside board representation. While we predict a positive relationship between the board independence and the firm size, the organizational complexity and the quotation status; our results generally do not support this conjecture.

In this paper, we examine the board composition of the largest three companies, two of which are the first to be privatized and find that the oversight function of corporate boards has not yet been fully utilized. We also analyze the state of corporate governance in Lebanon using the five principles of corporate governance, namely: protection of shareholder rights, equitable treatment of shareholders, protection of stakeholder rights, timely and accurate disclosure and transparency, diligent exercise of the board of directors' responsibilities. We try to highlight Lebanon's potential challenges given its recent experience in the privatization of the mobile telecommunication services, and its current and proposed institutional and regulatory reforms as laid out in the Paris II conference. We also examine the organizational determinants of the governance arrangements in privatized firms based on the experiences of other emerging economies.

This study, which examines the association between board monitoring and the level of voluntary disclosure, finds new evidence that firms with a higher proportion of independent directors on the board are associated with higher levels of voluntary disclosure. Although board size and CEO duality are not associated with voluntary disclosure, boards with a majority of independent directors have significantly higher levels of voluntary disclosure than firms with balanced boards. Notably, we find that the presence of an external governance mechanism, the regulatory environment, enhances the strength of the association between the proportion of independent directors and the level of voluntary disclosure. This association is some two to three times greater under a "disclosure-based" regulatory regime than under a "merit-based" regulatory regime. (c) 2006 University of Illinois.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - Aims to investigate the extent of the effectiveness of monitoring functions of board of directors, audit committee and concentrated ownership in reducing earnings management among 97 firms listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia over the period 2002-2003. Design/methodology/approach - The current study employs the cross-sectional modified version of Jones, where abnormal working capital accruals are used as proxy for earnings management. Findings - The study reveals that earnings management is positively related to the size of the board of directors. This supports the view that larger boards appear to be ineffective in their oversight duties relative to smaller boards. A possible explanation for the insignificant relationship between other corporate governance mechanisms (independence of board and audit committee) and earnings management is that the board of directors is seen as ineffective in discharging their monitoring duties due to management dominance over board matters. The apparent reason for this phenomenon is attributed to the board of directors' relative lack of knowledge in company's affairs. The study also found that ethnicity (race) has no effect in mitigating earnings management, possibly due to the more individualistic behaviour of the Bumiputra directors. The modernisation of Malaysia and also the increase in Bumiputra ownership of national wealth may have caused the Malays to be more individualistic, similar to their Chinese counterpart. Originality/value - Since, there are relatively few studies conducted in this area specifically among Malaysian firms, this study will broaden the scope by providing empirical evidence of the relationship between various corporate governance characteristics, cultural factors and earnings management.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the association between external audit fees, and board and audit committee characteristics of 736 Malaysian listed firms. It is hypothesised that good corporate governance practices reduce auditors' risk assessments, resulting in lower audit fees. Drawing on the existence of a clearly identifiable ethnic domination of board membership and ownership of Malaysian listed firms, the study also posits that Bumiputera-controlled firms pay higher audit fees because of their weaker governance practices. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a cross-sectional analysis of 736 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. Findings - Overall, the results of this study reveal that external audit fees are positively and significantly related to board independence, audit committee expertise, and the frequency of audit committee meetings. The study also finds a strong negative association between external audit fees and Bumiputera-owned firms. An additional analysis into the internal governance structures of firms in the sample show that Bumiputera firms practice more favourable corporate governance practices compared to their non-Bumiputera counterparts. Originality/value - This study is a unique contribution in that it provides data on corporate governance practices in Malaysia for a large sample in the period after the corporate governance reforms taken by Malaysian capital market regulators and participants. Previous studies have shown that Bumiputera-controlled firms pay higher audit fees than non-Bumiputera-controlled firms. These studies have not tested theoretical explanations for this fee differential.Atheoretical explanation provided in the current study is that Bumiputera-controlled firms pay higher audit fees than non-Bumiputera-controlled firms partially because of differences in corporate governance practices. The study finds conflicting results with previous research suggesting that corporate governance practices have changed in Malaysia since the amendments of Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirements, 2001.

Governance reform of publicly held corporations is an important topic these days, but a critical subtext has been missing from this often searing debate. Namely, what is the significance of these governance reforms, de jure and de facto, for the publicly held corporation's distant, smaller, but economically robust brethren - namely, the closely held, family-owned business? Should these family-owned entities be held to the same governance guidelines and standards that apply to those firms making up the ranks of the Fortune 500, for example? To put it another way, does one size fit all? We caution that many of the most popularized corporate governance practices may be detrimental to family businesses. Many of these recommendations may harm family unity or might be too complex for private firms, and many are applicable only to very large, public companies with dispersed ownership. Popular corporate governance practices are focused toward a market model of corporate governance, found prevalently in the United States and United Kingdom, which involves companies with a widely dispersed shareholder base and a majority of independent, outside board members. In contrast, the typical family-owned business exhibits characteristics of the control model of corporate governance, found prevalently in continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia, which involves companies with a concentrated shareholder base and family member "insiders" active in management and the board. As a result of these differences, many of the new laws and recommendations may actually be harmful to family-owned businesses. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

We examine corporate governance effectiveness when the CEO generates project ideas and the board of directors screens these ideas for approval. However, the precision of the board's screening information is controlled by the CEO. Moreover, both the CEO and the board have career concerns that interact. The board's career concerns cause it to distort its investment recommendation procyclically, whereas the CEO's career concerns cause her to sometimes reduce the precision of the board's information. Moreover, the CEO sometimes prefers a less able board, and this happens only during economic upturns, suggesting that corporate governance will be weaker during economic upturns.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The aim of this paper is to provide a preliminary analysis of the relationship between firm market value and the size and gender diversity of a board of directors for a sample of publicly listed Australian firms. Our results show that smaller boards appear to be more effective in representing the shareholders as smaller boards are associated with higher firm value. As board size increases firm value declines, however at a decreasing rate suggesting that the relationship between board size and firm value is not strictly linear. Our findings further indicate that gender diversity promotes shareholders' value as the presence of women directors is associated with higher firm value.

Conflict of interest between shareholders (principal) and managers (agent) is a potential weakness of the modern corporate form. Various monitoring mechanisms-pay for performance compensation schemes, mix of cash compensation and long term compensation, the independence of the board of directors, the market for takeovers, and capital structure-have been developed to discipline management and motivate them to maximize shareholder wealth. We test the hypothesis that dividend payout levels reflect the quality of and motivation for managerial decision making and are a function of performance and monitoring effectiveness. Consistent with this hypothesis, our analyses indicate that dividend payout, and dividend yield are functions of corporate performance, board structure, CEO tenure, and CEO ownership of company shares.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Prior studies examining the relation between the shareholdings by institutional investors and firm value have produced mixed results. These studies have assumed that a linear relation exists between corporate value and institutional shareholdings. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the nature of this relationship and by partitioning institutional investors into institutions that have appointed a representative to the board of directors of the firms in which they have a block investment and institutions with a similar holding but without a representative on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a sample of 123 firms with available financial and institutional ownership data. A cross-sectional regression analysis is used to test the relation between corporate value and institutional ownership with and without board representation. Findings - The results of the study suggest that share ownership by investors with board representation is positively related to the value of the firm at lower levels of ownership. However, as the share ownership increases, the impact on the value of the firm becomes negative, giving rise to a non-linear relation. The extent of shareholding by institutions without board representation, on the other hand, is not related to the value of the firm. Research limitations/implications - The findings show that institutions with board representation have greater incentives to monitor management, and therefore their presence should have a positive influence on firm value. However, at high levels of ownership, institutional investors with board representation may induce boards of directors to make sub-optimal decisions. Originality/value - The study provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between firm value and institutional ownership. That is, the effect of shareholding by institutions with board representation is likely to have a non-linear relation with firm value. (c) 2006, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The agency perspective of corporate governance emphasises the monitoring role of the board of directors. This study is concerned with analysing whether independent directors on the board and audit committee (recommendations of the ASX Corporate Governance Council, 2003) are associated with reduced levels of earnings management. The results support the hypotheses that a higher proportion of independent directors on the board and on the audit committee are associated with reduced levels of earnings management. The results are robust to alternative specifications of the model. This study adds to the very limited research into the relationship between corporate governance and earnings management in Australia. It also provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of some of the regulators' recommendations, which may be of value to regulators in preparing and amending corporate governance codes.

The paper evaluates the characteristics of corporate boards associated with layoff decisions using a large sample of UK firms suffering performance declines over the period 1994-2003. The results show that firms are less likely to respond to performance declines with employee layoffs when they have large boards. Further analysis shows that layoff decisions are positively associated with the proportion of outside directors and directors' remuneration. The findings provide some support to the recommendations of the b4Cadbury Report (1992) and b13Higgs Review (2003) on the importance of the structure and composition of board of directors in the corporate governance process.

This essay surveys research about the value of individual members of boards of directors. When directors join or exit corporate boards, company stock prices respond, often in magnitudes of 1% of firm value or more. Related research shows that when a significant event impacts the stock price of one company, the effects are transmitted to other companies that share board members in common with the primary company. Share price reactions are sensitive to variables such as a director's occupation, independence, and professional qualifications. Together, this evidence suggests that a well-functioning market for directors might already exist, making direct regulation unnecessary and possibly counter-productive.

This paper investigates the impact of M&As on bidder (CEO and other) executive compensation employing a unique sample of 100 completed bids in the UK over the 1998-2001 period. Our findings indicate that less independent and larger boards award CEOs significantly higher bonuses and salary following M&A completion both for the full sample and for the UK and US sub-samples. UK CEOs and executives are rewarded more for the effort exerted in accomplishing intra-industry or large mergers than for diversifying or small mergers and their cash pay is unaffected by other measures of their managerial skill or performance. US bidders are rewarded at higher levels than their UK counterparts and their remuneration is related only to measures of CEO dominance over the board of directors. Overall our findings offer support for the managerial power rather than the agency theory perspective on managerial compensation.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board process attributes and company performance of family-owned companies within an emerging country context. Design/methodology/approach - A survey questionnaire was developed and conducted on a sample of privately-held Turkish companies where a total of 386 usable questionnaires were returned. From the original data set a sub-sample of 266 firms with majority family ownership was created. Based on the extant literature, a set of 18 directors' collective attributes and 15 directors' individual attributes were identified as potentially relevant for company performance. Relying on the perceptions of the respondents, multiple subjective measures of company performance were adopted. Findings - Company performance is found to be positively related to the directors' collective and individual attributes which are associated with access to information, effectiveness of board, observance of fiduciary responsibility and performance evaluation. Practical implications - The essential implication of the study for establishing a desirable board climate is the necessity of having a keen focus on information. Sticking to fiduciary responsibility and application of performance evaluations are also indispensable attributes of high performance companies. These attitudes all combined seem to culminate in effective board process. Originality/value - While the subject of corporate governance is gaining an increasing attention from both academic and business circles, there is a dearth of research on board process attributes and their impact on company performance. This paper, therefore, aims to fill this lacuna by examining the relationship between board process attributes and company performance within a big emerging country context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution and persistence of different forms of business ownership in conjunction with the values and institutions that shaped those forms, and discuss the implications for corporate governance in India. Design/methodology/approach: Research paper analyzing broad historical trends, integrating multiple frameworks. Findings: Many ownership forms exist: family, government, professional, and foreign (multinational firms). In each period, shifts in values resulted in shifts in institutional and legislative frameworks, which, in turn, gave rise to different forms of business ownership. The end result, however, has been an amalgamation of diverse co-existing ownership models, with evidence of evolution towards more balanced values. Research limitations/implications: Comparative research involving other national contexts will help broaden our understanding of the origins and persistence of different forms of governance. Exploration of other governance mechanisms, such as the changing roles of the board of directors or the impact of legislation, also can be explored in the Indian context. Practical implications: As multinational firms expand their operations and outsourcing in India, they must understand the existing governance structures in order to better manage their activities. Originality/value: Perspective of corporate ownership and governance in India using a cultural, institutional, and historical perspective. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Management's (board of directors or executive officers) contribution to a firm is difficult to directly observe, although stock return performance can be a source of information. This study addresses this issue by extending the work of McIntosh, Rogers, Sirmans and Liang (1994) by analyzing management changes within REITs from 1984 to 2002. The findings indicate a significant relationship between negative performance and a management change from a period three months prior to the change in management. Logit and probit analysis are used to determine whether negative firm performance (measured by its relationship to market returns) can predict the likelihood of a management change. No predictive ability is found.

This paper compares corporate governance principles in the U.S., UK, and Germany. The U.S. and UK represent shareholder models of ownership and control whereas in Germany a stakeholder approach to corporate governance provides greater input for creditors, employees and other groups affected by corporate decision making. Recent changes in the U.S. and UK as evidenced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and a variety of reports including the Cadbury Committee Report recognize the importance of a more independent board of directors, completely independent audit committee, and strong internal controls. In Germany, some of these initiatives have been suggested as well. The U.S. can learn from their British counterparts and endorse governance advances such as to separate out the role of the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. Other changes that would strengthen governance in the U.S. include to: limit the number of boards on which a person can serve; recognize the rights of stockholders to nominate directors; and give shareholders a more direct role in board oversight. The U.S. should consider adopting some of the German attributes in their governance system by incorporating employees and employee representative groups into the oversight process. After all, it was the employees that worked for Enron who suffered the most as a result of corporate fraud including a loss of jobs and the near wipe-out of their 401K retirement plans.

We analyse the profile of the boards of directors of 142 Brazilian publicly-held companies in 1999. Directors were divided into four distinct categories, following b6Bhagat and Black (2000 Working Paper no. 143, Columbia Law School) criteria for the US market. Our survey analyses the degree of independence of directors in relation to their respective controlling shareholders. Our results indicate that the controlling shareholders' representatives largely dominate the boards. One intriguing finding is that minority shareholders do not use the mechanisms at their disposal to elect directors. There seems to be low interest by non-controlling shareholders in participating in shareholders' meetings, and consequently in selecting representatives for the board of directors. This could partly be explained by the lack of proxy voting mechanisms. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of a firm's leadership structure on its ability to generate value from loans by examining the market reaction to the disclosure of Canadian bank credit agreements. Two leadership structures are considered in this paper. In the first scenario, the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board are held by two different persons (denoted as a Separate CEO-Chair structure); in the second scenario, both positions are held by the same person (denoted as a Combined CEO-Chair structure). We observe a stronger market reaction to the announcement of bank credit agreements when firms have a Separate CEO-Chair structure (relative to a Combined CEO-Chair structure). This stronger market reaction for firms with a Separate CEO-Chair structure suggests that the division of CEO and Chair of the Board responsibilities between two people enhances a firm's ability to generate value from its loans. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the observed market reaction for firms with a Separate CEO-Chair structure is even greater when the size of the board of directors is small. Our results also indicate that bank monitoring activities are more valuable for firms with a Combined CEO-Chair structure and no institutional shareholder. (c) 2006 University of Illinois.

In this paper we tested the relationship between the IRR and the corporate governance choices of 87 Italian closed-end funds for the management of 698 private equity operations carried out from 1999 to 2003. In particular, we looked for information about the role of independent directors and their ability to stimulate firm growth and the closed-end funds final return, compared with the performance of dependent directors. We found no differences in the performance of venture-backed firms due to the presence of independent members in the board of directors, and concluded that this does not influence final results.

This article tells of the changes experienced by a family business, through restructuring under outside professional management, until being taken over by a multinational company. Evidence was collected from interviews, annual reports and media articles. As a family business, the company exploited lower agency costs and sustained its profitability. Debt levels remained low. Under external professional managers, profitability declined and debt levels rose sharply. Informal communication networks were no longer utilized, and the professional managers were subject to criticism for excessive spending, inappropriate skills and a lack of industry knowledge. The board of directors began to function less effectively. Poor performance led to restructuring under three different CEOs, yet costs continually increased, profitability declined, and a takeover bid was successful. However, all responsibility, of course, cannot be placed on the new professional managers, who inherited responsibility for some decisions made prior to their period of stewardship. Also the family did not adequately plan for successful transition to professional management. (c) 2006 SAGE Publications.

The objective of this paper is to study the role of large institutional investors in monitoring the performance of company management in India, in comparison with other advanced countries in the world. The focus of this study is based on the pattern of debt and equity holdings and its relationship to boards of directors' intervention and monitoring of company management. Our analysis revealed that the role of nominee directors of financial institutions has been restricted to safeguard their institutional interest in the companies. It is unfortunate that corporate governance regulation has taken on a strict form without any commensurate conviction on the part of corporate leadership. The responses thus revealed that their role in the board of directors meetings, in assisting better management practices, productivity, efficiency and effective functioning of the company has been dissatisfactory. Further, we find that the role of institutional investors, like mutual funds and pension funds, seems to not be active in corporate governance. If the nominee directors are endowed with expertise and an independent disposition, they can bring the much-needed transformation to boardrooms, allowing board meetings to become effective strategy sessions for decision-making.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

This preliminary study aims to develop a corporate governance index based on governance practices followed by the listed firms at Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). Since the corporate governance concept is at very initial level of its implementation and practices, this study also analyses the structure of good corporate governance practices and level of awareness about new regulations of corporate governance implemented by Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan. The data is collected through a structured questionnaire covering seven corporate governance categories: audit committee, board of directors, charter/bylaws, director education, executive and director compensation, ownership, and the progressive practices during the year 2004. The results indicate that all of the firm performance measures; return on equity, net profit margin, sales growth and dividend yield (except Tobin's Q) have their expected positive relation with corporate governance index score (Gov-Score) and are significant in correlation and decile analysis. This suggests that firms with relatively poor governance are relatively less profitable, less valuable, and pay less cash to their shareholders. The role of audit and board of director are highly associated with good performance while the governance categories related to director's education and charter/bylaws are least associated with good performance.

This paper reports on the role of NEDs among Ghanaian SMEs. The results of this study revealed that less than half of the SMEs sampled engage the services of NED. The study also revealed that relatively larger SMEs are more likely to employ the services of NEDs. We also found that over 80% of the SMEs with NEDs were either growing or growing rapidly. NEDs' contributions were also found to be multi-various and cut across the range of SME board functions. The study showed that most SMEs acquire NEDs mainly through informal personal contacts such as family, friends of a director, business friends rather than through formal arrangements.

Almost 27% of the CEOs in a sample of 790 newly partially privatized firms in China are former or current government bureaucrats. Firms with politically connected CEOs underperform those without politically connected CEOs by almost 18% based on three-year post-IPO stock returns and have poorer three-year post-IPO earnings growth, sales growth, and change in returns on sales. The negative effect of the CEO's political ties also show up in the first-day stock return. Finally, firms led by politically connected CEOs are more likely to appoint other bureaucrats to the board of directors rather than directors with relevant professional backgrounds.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose - The paper aims to examine the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in China. Design/methodology/approach - Using an OLS-regression model to test the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and the level of voluntary disclosure. The sample is based on 559 firm observations in 2002. Findings - Higher blockholder ownership and foreign listing/shares ownership is associated with increased disclosure. However, managerial ownership, state ownership, and legal-person ownership are not related to disclosure. An increase in independent directors increases corporate disclosure and CEO duality is associated with lower disclosure. The paper also finds that larger firms had greater disclosure, while firms with growth opportunities are reluctant to disclose information voluntarily. Research limitations/implications - Firstly, the sample iscomprised of companies listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2002 and only 45.7 percent of representative firms listed in China. Secondly, the disclosure checklist does not cover all voluntary disclosure in corporations as employed and supported in several prior studies. Thirdly, the award of checklist items may be subjected to errors. Practical implications - This paper indicates the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and corporate voluntary disclosure, and provides evidence for Chinese regulators to improve corporate governance and optimize ownership structure. Originality/value - Distinct from prior empirical research based on disclosure behavior in developed-western markets, this study examines the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in the Asian setting of China.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

Recent US corporate governance reforms introduced extensive regulations and guidelines for public corporations, particularly corporate boards. This article evaluates the extent to which empirical research on corporate boards and firm performance supports these reforms. Building on the meta-analysis conducted by Zahra and Pearce (1989), we review 105 studies published between 1989 and 2005. We find most of the practices mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the regulations issued by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, had not been subject to prior study. Where board characteristics have been studied, we find limited guidance for policymakers on identifying governance practices that result in more effective firm performance. In an effort to increase the relevance of future research on boards and firm performance, we provide a framework on corporate boards. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose This paper aims to investigate the determinants of good governance in the US firms. Design-methodology-approach The data are taken from a sample of 624 US listed and non-financial firms for the period of 1994-2003. Four indices were constructed that summarize the governance quality: one indice for the board of directors, another one for the board committees, a third one for the audit committee, and a fourth representing an overall or total index. Multiple regressions analyses are used in the study to find the determinants of strong governance. Findings The empirical results show statistically significant and positive associations between each governance index (exception to board index) and firm size, investment opportunities, intangible assets and directors and officers ownership. Furthermore, institutional ownership and external financing needs are positively related to each governance index considered. However, growth opportunities and performance have no significant effect on governance quality. Research limitations-implications Other corporate governance mechanisms could be considered (transparency and disclosure, anti-takeover provisions and shareholder's rights). Originality-value This paper adds evidence to the important debate about corporate governance ratings. It gives a most comprehensive analysis to date in term of sample size and breath coverage. This paper also offers a new contribution to the debate on the determinants of good governance by isolating the effects of firm characteristics on the board of directors from the effect on compensation and nominating committees and from the effect on audit committee.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Legal rights of investors are recognized as an essential component of corporate governance. We assess the efficacy of these rights by examining board changes surrounding the filings of shareholder derivative lawsuits. We find that the incidence of derivative lawsuits is higher for firms with a greater likelihood of agency conflicts. We also find that derivative lawsuits are associated with significant improvements in the boards of directors. In particular, the proportion of outside representation on the board of directors increases. There is also some evidence that other board characteristics change favorably. These findings suggest that shareholder derivative lawsuits are not frivolous as is often claimed, but rather that they can serve as an effective corporate governance mechanism.

Purpose - This paper seeks to argue that boards can be playing a more proactive role in contributing to organizational effectiveness and that their composition requires greater research attention. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, the paper empirically examines the relationship between key board composition variables and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - At this stage in the development of the approach, the focus is on a sub-set of the elements proposed in the group dynamics literature. The population for this study comprises all companies included in the Canadian TSE 300 Composite Index (renamed the S&P/TSX Composite Index). This study uses cross-sectional regression analyses to examine the nature of the relationships between board composition and firm performance. Findings - The data analyses revealed that high levels of experience, appropriate team size, moderate levels of variation in age and team tenure were correlated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Boards of directors (BOD) are teams whose effectiveness can be assessed through group dynamic constructs in the organizational behaviour literature. Further research is needed to examine the intricate dynamics that might moderate or mediate the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. Practical implications - The findings provide a much-needed benchmark to consider whether the composition of boards is optimal, given the functions and mandate. In addition, the study highlights the opportunity costs of boards, restricting their roles to agency issues. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper tests some of the many variables that can be extrapolated from the group dynamics research. The paper calls on boards to examine what BOD functionality really entails, and argues for more proactive behaviours aimed at strategic firm issues. (c) 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Banks are "special" financial institutions generating distinct corporate governance challenges. The present paper examines the relationship between two of the most pertinent corporate governance factors-that is, the size of the Board of Directors and the proportion of non-executive directors-and firm performance on a sample of 58 large European banks over the period 2002-2004. The empirical analysis embraces a number of bank-specific variables. Our results reveal that bank profitability is negatively related to the size of the Board of Directors, while the impact of Board composition, although positive in all models, is, in most cases, insignificant. The results are robust after controlling for firm-specific variables. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose The effect of corporate governance on firm performance has long been of great interest to financiers, economists, behavioural scientists, legal practitioners and business operators. Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design-methodology-approach A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations-implications The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality-value The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests.

This paper tests the relationship between ownership/leadership structures and stock returns for firms listed in Taiwan. A "Governance Index" is built based on four different aspects of the company's governance structure: 1. CEO duality, 2. Size of the board of directors, 3. Managements' holdings and 4. Block shareholders' holding. This index is used as a proxy measure of the effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanism. We propose that firms under good governance should outperform those under poor governance. We find a striking relationship between our governance index and stock performance of firms. The results imply that our corporate governance index is successful in evaluating the effectiveness of the governance mechanism of firms in Taiwan. (c) 2007 The Authors.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

A firm's board of directors, based on its risk tolerance or "appetite," sets the corporate objectives. It is then the management's job to meet the objectives by adopting appropriate strategies. However, the board can design compensation policies to encourage desired management strategy choices. This paper explores the extent to which management compensation policies are aligned with strategy choices for obtaining new technology. Firms obtain new technology either through internal R&D or through acquisitions, often labeled "make" and "buy" strategies, respectively. The "make" strategy is inherently more risky, with much of the high risk idiosyncratic. Furthermore, U.S. GAAP requires that R&D expenditures be expensed but allows capitalization of acquisition costs, thus a firm using the "make" as opposed to the "buy" strategy will experience a greater negative effect on accounting earnings. I hypothesize that these differences will lead risk-averse and utility-maximizing managers to implement the "buy" strategy if their compensation is heavily weighted on accounting-based performance measures. Conversely, managers with more stock-based compensation, especially stock options, are more likely to choose to develop new technology internally. Using data from U.S. high-tech industries and a simultaneous equations regression framework, I find evidence consistent with the above hypotheses. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper examines the factors that affect the activity of the audit committees in Spain. The data used in the analyses are collected from the Spanish stock market in 2003. The results show the existence of a non-linear relationship between the managerial stock ownership and the activity of the audit committee. We have also verified the existence of a lower audit committee's activity in highly leveraged firms and when the ownership structure is concentrated in the hands of large shareholders. The large firms have more active committees than small firms. Finally, we have not found any evidence of a significant influence of the composition of the board or the audit committee on the activity of the latter. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study analyses the relationship between ownership structure and board of director composition and their influences on the total factor productivity (TFP) of Taiwan's firms. The empirical results show that the curvilinear specification is better to capture the relationship between inside ownership and firm productivity. Meanwhile, the ownership structure in a firm indeed affects differences in TFP between conglomerate firms and non-conglomerate firms, high-tech firms and non-high-tech firms, and family-owned firms and non-family-owned firms. Additionally, a smaller board may be less encumbered by bureaucratic problems and more functional and CEO duality may be able to improve productivity. Furthermore, productivity deteriorates with increasing proportion of collateralised shares. More institutional holdings, however, are an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of collateralised shares on TFP. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

Conventional wisdom suggests that giving monitored agents an oversight role may blunt the effectiveness of the monitoring process. In contrast, I show that less independent boards can sometimes be more effective at monitoring. Fully independent boards have incentives to shirk monitoring ex post, after the agents' productive inputs are sunk, if the boards cannot commit ex ante to monitoring. However, boards with inside directors may have incentives to monitor the agents ex post. The demand for insiders thus arises endogenously as they allow boards to indirectly commit to monitoring and thereby facilitate the monitoring process. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The historiographies of Mexico and Brazil have implicitly stated that business networks were crucial for the initial industrialization of these two countries. Recently, differing visions on the importance of business networks have arisen. In the case of Mexico, the literature argues that entrepreneurs relied heavily on an informal institutional structure to obtain necessary resources and information. In contrast, the recent historiography of Brazil suggests that after 1890 the network of corporate relations became less important for entrepreneurs trying to obtain capital and concessions, once the institutions promoted financial markets and easy entry for new businesses. Did entrepreneurs in Brazil and Mexico organize their networks differently to deal with the different institutional settings? We examine whether in Mexico businessmen relied more on networks of interlocking boards of directors and other informal arrangements to do business than in Brazil. Our hypothesis is confirmed by three related results: (1) the total number of connections (i.e., the density of the network) was higher in Mexico than Brazil; (2) in Mexico, there was one dense core network, while in Brazil we find fairly dispersed clusters of corporate board interlocks; and most importantly, (3) politicians played a more important role in the Mexican network of corporate directors than their counterparts in Brazil. Interestingly, even though Brazil and Mexico relied on very different institutional structures, both countries had similar rates of growth between 1890 and 1913. However, the dense and exclusive Mexican network might have ended up increasing the social and political tensions that led to the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920).

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the independence of audit committees is affected by the degree of control exerted by managers over the board of directors. Results from a sample of 75 listed Spanish companies show that the majority of firms that voluntarily adopted an audit committee between 1998 and 2001, made an effort to guarantee their independence from management. The degree of independence is shown to be determined by the proportion of inside directors on the board, the same person holding both the CEO and board chairperson positions, and the level of management ownership. These findings may have political implications because existing regulations do not limit the presence of inside directors on audit committees. The presence of inside directors may compromise effectiveness, turning audit committees into instruments of management to provide the appearance of monitoring.

This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.

The Turkish Capital Market Board introduced its Corporate Governance Principles in 2003. The Principles are based on the concepts of equality, transparency, accountability and responsibility. While they are generally modelled on the Corporate Governance Principles of the OECD, they also take into consideration the special needs of Turkish company structures and Turkish company law and practice. The Principles apply on a comply-or-explain basis and contain detailed guidelines on the rights of shareholders, public disclosure and transparency, stakeholders and the board of directors. Listed companies are under an obligation to issue an annual corporate governance compliance report showing the extent of their compliance with the Principles and explaining the reasons for any deviation. The board of directors and the company can be held liable by investors for deceiving them with wrong or misleading information contained in the report. As for the actual implementation of the Principles, surveys indicate that there is room for improvement and that more time is needed for full application. (c) 2007 T.M.C. Asser Press.

Purpose - The paper aims to focus on a well-known topic in the financial literature: the relation between capital structure and firm value. The controversial empirical results on this topic can be attributable to a lack of attention to the interaction between capital structure and other corporate governance variables. In fact, capital structure represents a corporate governance device that can preserve corporate governance efficiency and protect its ability to create value. Design/methodology/approach - The paper, after a synthetic review of the main literature, defines, with a descriptive model, a theoretical approach that can contribute in clearing up the relation between capital structure, corporate governance and value. It provides a research proposition, and some suggestions, that should be applied for future empirical research on this topic while it also promotes a more precise design for empirical analysis. Findings - The debate on the relation between capital structure and a firm's value needs to take directly into account the role of moderation and/or mediation of the corporate governance. It is necessary to consider the presence of complementarity between capital structure and other corporate governance variables such as: ownership concentration; managerial ownership; the role of the board of directors; and so on. Research limitations/implications - This paper promotes, as an aim for future research, a verification of the validity of this model through application of the analysis to a wide sample of firms. Originality/value - The paper tried to suggest how to improve previous controversial analysis on this topic. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper analyses the effect of the Spanish privatisation process on the performance and corporate governance of the firms that were privatised through public offerings over the 1985-2003 period. Using conventional pre- versus post-privatisation comparisons, we do not find significant improvements in privatised firms' profitability and efficiency. However, our results do suggest a change in firms' ownership structure and in the characteristics of Boards of Directors after privatisation. Firms' ownership concentration decreases as a consequence of the relinquishment of control by the State and the Boards of Directors are restructured with the creation of new specialised committees and the incorporation of more executives.

This study examines whether the likelihood of becoming involuntarily delisted from NYSE is associated with a firm's board of directors and ownership characteristics. To this end we compare 161 firms that were delisted from NYSE between 1998 and 2004 to a set of industry and size-matched control firms. Consistent with our expectations, we find that the likelihood of delisting is related to a firm's governance characteristics. Our results on the importance of the board of directors are new to this setting and add to a large body of evidence linking corporate boards and ownership characteristics to corporate performance.

Increased engagement by investors with the companies in which they invest has been a major change in Western economies since the 1980s. Shareholder value provides rationale and incentive for investor engagement. The book summarizes the basic principles of shareholder value, and explains the reasons for its growth, especially in the UK and the USA. The authors outline a spectrum of investor engagement ranging from indirect/laissez-faire influence via (threat of) exit to direct intervention in specific areas of management practice. The book focuses on two types of investor, institutional investors and private equity/venture capital investors. Different types of institutional investors have different incentives for engagement, and adopt different methods. 'Universal investors' with long time horizons, such as pension funds, have especially strong incentives for engagement, as illustrated by USS Limited. The book distinguishes between institutional investors' routine and extraordinary engagement, and shows how collaboration amongst investors through organizations such as the Institutional Shareholders' Committee offsets the high costs of monitoring and provides means for ensuring compliance with best City practice'. The engagement of private equity funds is illustrated through case studies of equity funds and the portfolio firms in which they invested. But corporate managers are not simply passive reactors to investors' interventions: managers seek to influence investors, for example through managing market expectations. Shareholder value conceptions are not universal: they are strong in the UK and the USA, but are weaker in coordinated market economies such as Germany. The book concludes by evaluating the normative case for shareholder value and investor engagement, arguing that conventional analyses overestimate the efficiency arguments for shareholder value and the equity arguments against shareholder value. The future development of corporate governance is seen to require greater openness and the inclusion of a wider range of interests, not the further enhancement of the protection accorded to shareholder interests.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the pay and performance of chief executive officers (CEOs) in Portuguese, non-profit organizations (NPOs), focusing on the role played by the economic performance of the organization, together with that played by the structure of the board and the individual characteristics of the manager. If the CEO can influence the board structure, agency problems arise, which in turn allow the CEO to extract rent and demand compensation in excess of the equilibrium level. Design/methodology/ approach - An ordinary least squares (OLS) model and an instrumental variable (IV) models are estimated for comparative purposes. The IV permits to account for endogenous variables in the regression. Findings - It is concluded that governance is important in the Portuguese non-profit sector. Several variables affect the CEO, namely, organization performance variables, board composition variables and individual variables. This result highlights the urgent need for a code of governance practice to be introduced in this sector. Moreover, the paper integrates human capital in the definition of the earnings, concluding that this also contributes to earnings. Research limitations/implications - This paper has two limitations. The first is related to the data set and the second with the method adopted. With the reference to the data set, the span is limited and therefore the generalization of this result is questionable. A larger data span is needed to confirm the present results. Relative to the method, the OLS is unable to handle endogeneity variables in a regression. The instrumental variables (IV) can overcome this result, but some critics to this method have appear recently, when there are heterogeneous across subjects and local IV are needed. Practical implication - A governance code should be adopted, involving NPO managers in their definition. A regulatory agency that will be the watch dog of the process should be implemented to enforce the modernization of Portuguese NPO. Originality/value - This is the first paper analyzing governance issues on Portuguese NPO and the second paper at European level on NPO governance. It clarifies two issues, the absence of governance principles in Portuguese NPO and the need of a regulatory agency in this context. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This chapter addresses the introduction of the executive officer system as an alternative to the traditional insider board structure. As a result, since 1997 board sizes have decreased and a greater separation has been made between monitoring and management responsibilities. Some firms have also introduced outside directors and performance-related compensation schemes, such as stock options. The extent of these reforms among Japanese firms is examined using a survey-based Corporate Governance Score (CGS) for each corporation. Higher CGS scores are associated with better performance, a higher percentage of foreign shareholders, and a lower percentage of stable shareholders. However, among firms exposed to capital market pressures, the presence of strong employee participation also has a significant positive impact on the degree of reform and suggests a strong mutual reliance on capital markets and long-term employment among strongly performing Japanese firms.

This paper analyses the effect of the introduction of managerial incentives and new human capital on enterprise performance immediately after privatization in the Czech Republic. We find weak evidence for the presence of managerial incentives: only from 1997, 3 to 4 years after privatization, does poor performance significantly increase the probability of managerial change. Nevertheless, replacing the managing director in a newly privatized firm improves subsequent performance. This indicates that the privatized firms operate below potential under the incumbent management. We show that the institutional framework matters as well: managerial turnover improves performance only if the management is closely interconnected with the board of directors and thus holds effective executive authority.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance and corporate fraud by utilizing logit regression and by employing a sample of 176 firms listed in Chinese stock markets during the period from 2001 to 2005. The results s reveal that: (1) the proportion of independent members in board of directors is lower for firms experiencing corporate fraud than for no-fraud firms; (2) the firms with CEOs being the chairmen of board of directors are more likely to commit corporate fraud than the other firms; (3) the financial incentives to executives are greater for firms experiencing corporate fraud than for no-fraud firms; (4) capital structure has significant and positive effect on corporate fraud in China.

It is often argued that Black-Scholes (1973) values overstate the subjective value of stock options granted to risk-averse and under-diversified executives. We construct a "representative" Swiss executive and extend the certainty-equivalence approach presented by Hall and Murphy (2002) to assess the value-cost wedge of executive stock options. Even with low coefficients of relative risk aversion, the discount can be above 50 per cent compared to the Black-Scholes values. Regression analysis reveals that the equilibrium level of executive compensation is explained by economic determinant variables such as firm size and growth opportunities, whereas the pay-for-performance sensitivity remains largely unexplained. Firms with larger boards of directors pay higher wages, indicating potentially unresolved agency conflicts. We reject the hypothesis that cross-sectional differences in the amount of executive pay vanish when risk-adjusted values are used as the dependent variable. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study provides evidence that Chinese initial public offerings (IPOs) report better operating performance than industry peers in the pre-IPO period, and worse performance in post-IPO period compared to the pre-IPO level. We find that related party transactions (RPTs) with controlling shareholders have significant effects on the long-run performance of IPO firms. Controlling shareholders structure a large percentage of operating (non-loan) RPTs to artificially boost revenues and/or profits of their IPO subsidiaries in the pre-IPO period. However, in the post-IPO period, controlling shareholders discontinue this RPT-based earnings manipulation practice and begin to expropriate IPO subsidiaries by obtaining a large percentage of cash loans, primarily in return for profits and/or resources transferred into the IPO subsidiaries in the pre-IPO period. Finally, we find that state-controlled IPO firms with a highly concentrated ownership structure and a less independent board of directors are more likely to be expropriated by controlling shareholders in the post-IPO period through related loans.

Following the publication of the Spanish Code of Corporate Good Governance in 1998 (known as the Olivencia Code), some companies voluntarily created audit committees in line with the recommendation that all firms, and especially listed companies, should do so. The aim of this work is to analyse the factors associated with voluntary audit committee formation in companies listed on the Spanish Capital Market through 1999. In particular we analyse factors such as board independence and size, the board chairman/CEO duality, auditor size, agency costs, ownership, economies of scale, institutional investors, the audit report and auditor tenure. We find that voluntary audit committee formation is positively correlated with the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors and economies of scale, while the evidence reveals a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between board size and voluntary audit committee formation. We also formed another sample excluding financial institutions, for which we found that audit committee formation is positively associated with board independence and economies of scale, and negatively associated with the audit report and audit tenure.

In this paper we relate the board's attributes to the firm's opacity as measured by the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread. We find that larger boards and outside directors are associated with reduced opacity, especially in freestanding firms. However, directors' excess control is associated with a significant increase in firm's opacity. We also find that the presence of family pyramidal holding defuses any potential monitoring benefits of board attributes. Our findings suggest that the firm's ultimate ownership structure is not neutral in determining the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors. This might help explain existing mixed evidence on the monitoring roles of the board of directors. Copyright (c) 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This exploratory chapter provides a research framework based on corporate governance systems that identify six areas for future study using and framing questions to stimulate research. The framework is developed by using selected corporate governance elements identified by Goergen, Manjon, and Renneboog (2004, p. 2) and the Treadway Commission's depiction of an ethical control environment that was adopted by COSO. The six areas include (1) Virtue Ethics: Role of the External Auditor; (2) Ethical Tone at the Top: Audit Committee Responsibilities; (3) Custodial Responsibilities: The Role of the Board of Directors; (4) Fiduciary Responsibilities: The Role of the CEO; (5) Building Shareholder Trust: Financial Statements that "Present Fairly"; and (6) Ethical Values: The Control Environment. The conceptual framework describes how each element within a corporate governance system interrelates with other elements (internal effect) and with external audit and regulatory requirements (external effect). Accounting researchers need to broaden their horizons to advance accounting ethics research. The issue of whether corporate governance systems operate in an ethical manner is a natural extension of earlier research that emphasized ethical reasoning, virtue ethics, and developing an ethical culture for an organization.

The board of directors and the features that characterize them have been said to have significant effects on firm performance. In this paper, we examine a number of characteristics of the board of directors of the firms listed in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in order to assess their impact on firm performance. To achieve this objective, data were obtained from the firms listed in NSE from 1996 to 2004. Over the nine- year period of the study, a database of 13,267 directorships was developed. It was found that the listed firms were characterized with a fairly small board size (averaging 8.4 persons), and a quarter of the firms that were studied had members of the same family on their boards of directors. Furthermore, regression results show that such a pattern of family control of boardrooms tend to reduce shareholders value and tends to foster long CEO tenures that may not be justified by improved firm performance. Whatever its shortcomings as an estimator, our OLS technique has provided results that seem to offer a reassuring conclusion that membership of boards of directors should be based on performance, and that the current wave of family affiliation in Nigerian boardrooms is not congenial to sound corporate governance and firm performance.

This paper presents a synthesis and analysis of corporate governance guidelines of the twenty-five European Union (EU) member states. The paper focuses on observable and quantifiable aspects of corporate governance including key aspects pertaining to the composition and operation of the board of directors, audit committee, remuneration committee, nomination committee, and other corporate governance policies. Using an Australian corporate governance ranking system, contained in the Horwath Report, the Corporate Governance (CG) Guidelines were analysed and rated. Based on the rating system, thirteen of the twenty-five EU countries had guidelines that were considered to be lacking in several key areas. In contrast, Ireland and the United Kingdom have the most detailed and rigorous corporate governance guidelines. Countries with less developed economic frameworks have the least detailed and rigorous corporate governance guidelines. Finally the specificity of corporate governance guidelines varies greatly between the various countries either due to the system used (one or two tier systems) or whether the country's legal system is predominately common or statutory law. The aim of the paper is not to determine the compliance of individual companies on their company's CG Code but to rate the Codes of the countries so as to assess whether there ought to be stricter regulatory measures by the EU on its member states.

This article draws on a sample of 647 Brazilian publicly traded corporations to explore some of the features of corporate governance in this country. The results that due to the size of the sample (80% of total population) are particularly reliable, show that ownership concentration is by far the mostly used governance mechanism what matches the patterns observed in Continental European countries. Results also raise doubts about the real role boards of directors play in Brazilian open corporations, what offers new streams for researchers willing to tackle issues in emerging economies.

The monitoring role performed by the board of directors is an important corporate governance control mechanism, especially in countries where external mechanisms are less well developed. The gender composition of the board can affect the quality of this monitoring role and thus the financial performance of the firm. This is part of the "business case" for female participation on boards, though arguments may also be framed in terms of ethical considerations. While the issue of board gender diversity has attracted growing research interest in recent years, most empirical results are based on U.S. data. This article adds to a growing number of non-U.S. studies by investigating the link between the gender diversity of the board and firm financial performance in Spain, a country which historically has had minimal female participation in the workforce, but which has now introduced legislation to improve equality of opportunities. We investigate the topic using panel data analysis and find that gender diversity - as measured by the percentage of women on the board and by the Blau and Shannon indices - has a positive effect on firm value and that the opposite causal relationship is not significant. Our study suggests that investors in Spain do not penalise firms which increase their female board membership and that greater gender diversity may generate economic gains.

This study provides empirical evidence that firms with larger boards have lower variability of corporate performance. The results indicate that board size is negatively associated with the variability of monthly stock returns, annual accounting return on assets, Tobin's Q, accounting accruals, extraordinary items, analyst forecast inaccuracy, and R&D spending, the level of R&D expenditures, and the frequency of acquisition and restructuring activities. The results are consistent with the view that it takes more compromises for a larger board to reach consensus, and consequently, decisions of larger boards are less extreme, leading to less variable corporate performance.

Agency-based studies of boards of directors address factors relevant to board vigilance with respect to the monitoring of senior managers. We argue that relying solely on director vigilance may be limiting because vigilance without relevant experience is unlikely to ensure board effectiveness. Our contention is that boards comprising vigilant directors, as well as directors with appropriate knowledge gained through experience, not only will be better monitors, but also more useful advisors to top managers. The focus of our study is on the effect on acquisition outcomes of the interaction of board vigilance and director experiential learning. Consistent with our expectations, the empirical findings indicate that vigilant boards rich in appropriate experience are associated with superior acquisition outcomes.

By examining the level of ownership concentration across firms, we determine how principal-principal conflict, defined as the incongruence of ownership goals among shareholder groups in a corporation, impacts agency costs of Chinese boards of directors. Based on data from Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during 1999-2003, we found that ownership concentration had a U-shaped relationship with board compensation, board size and the presence of independent directors. These results provide corroborating evidence that principal-principal conflict can lead to high agency costs. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to advance the understanding of boards of directors in family firms. Building on generational changes in family attributes, we argue that firms in a different generational phase have different governance needs and characteristics. With regard to board task needs, the empirical results indicate a convex generational evolution in the need for board advice, and a rise over the generations in the need for board control. With regard to board composition, we find that the likelihood of having an outside director on the board has a convex generational trend. This relationship seems to be fully mediated by the firm's board task needs. Furthermore, the number of family directors seems to increase over the generations. This study demonstrates that it is important to consider the generational phase of the family firm in order to understand its governance system. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

This paper analyses the effect of family ownership on performance in an emerging economy. Two dimensions represent family ownership: ownership concentration and characteristics of family control (i.e. family involvement in the board of directors). The study also includes the effect of firm institutional relatedness on performance, meaning the degree of informal embeddedness or interconnectedness with dominant institutions. The empirical analysis uses a data set of publicly traded Chilean firms from 2000 and 2003. The evidence indicates that performance depends on ownership concentration and that family control and institutional relatedness also have a significant effect. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between the compensation of the top five executives at a set of over 400 publicly listed Canadian firms and various internal and external corporate governance-related factors. The media is full of stories suggesting a relationship between large executive compensation packages and failures in governance at various levels within organisations, but there exists little formal analysis of many of these relationships. Our analysis provides empirical evidence supporting some of these assertions, refuting others and documenting new relationships. We find that variances in internal governance related to differences across firms in the characteristics of the CEO, compensation committee and board of directors do influence both the level and composition of executive compensation, especially for the CEO. Considering external measures of corporate governance, we find that different types of shareholders and competitive environments impact executive compensation. We do not find that either the internal or external governance characteristics dominate. (c) 2008 The Author.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the impact of corporate governance on the cash-holding policies of firms with different investment opportunities. It is difficult to determine the optimal level of cash holdings for "listed new economy" firms (firms in the computer, software, Internet, telecommunications, or networking industries), which require large amounts of capital for investment opportunities with high return potential. Unlike in "old economy" firms, for which investment opportunities are relatively limited, corporate governance in listed new economy firms may create shareholder protections that make investors willing to accept higher levels of corporate cash holdings. Research Findings/Results: By examining American Standard and Poor 1,500 companies, the evidence shows that CEO ownership and board independence affect the cash holdings in listed new economy and old economy firms differently. Specifically, higher managerial cash holdings tend to reduce cash holdings in old economy firms and higher board independence tend to increase cash holdings in listed new economy firms. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the association between agency theory and cash theories. Given different firm characteristics, the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings verifies the implication of agency theory in explaining corporate cash policy. Practical Implications: While firms in new economy industries may be eager for more flexible governance codes in order to maintain the freedom of decision making, the evidence from this study suggests that establishing effective governance mechanisms may, in turn, effectively enlarge the degree of freedom for these firms to make timely business decisions.

Purpose - The relationship between the board characteristics (i.e. board independence, CEO duality, board size, board meeting and board tenure) and the ownership structure (i.e. managerial ownership, family ownership and institutional ownership) and earnings quality is examined. Design/methodology/ approach - Data from 280 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board for the year 2004 is used. Findings - Significant association was found between board tenure and earnings quality. In addition, a positive significant association was found between outside board ownership and family ownership and earnings quality. However no significant relationship was found between board of directors' independence and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications - The association between audit committees' characteristics and earnings quality was not examined. An examination of the impact of ownership structure on boards of directors and audit committees is warranted. An investigation of the impact of the ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia using separate test on family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms is suggested. Practical implications - The appropriateness of policy directives requiring majority independent directors may be considered by policy makers. Originality/value - The conflict of interest between outside shareholders and managers in a diffused ownership support the agency theory. However, utility of agency theory to explain the conflicts between the controlling owners and the minority shareholders where ownership concentration is prevalent is limited. Whilst demonstrating the dominant impact of ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia the study calls for alternative explanations of corporate governance practices in different institutional settings.

We examine whether takeover threats affect the importance of board size using the passage of state antitakeover laws enacted in mid-to-late 1980s as our empirical setting. While the Complement Hypothesis predicts that board size matters more before the passage of the laws, the Substitute Hypothesis predicts the opposite. For a sample of 350 Forbes 500 firms over the period 1984-1991, we find a significant association between smaller boards and better firm performance before passage of antitakeover laws, but a much weaker relation (reduced by more than one-third) after the takeover restrictions were in place. Consistent with the Complement Hypothesis, this finding suggests that decreasing board size is more valuable when the market for corporate control is more active.

Numerous significant past and recent contributions to the literature on the efficacy of corporate boards of directors notwithstanding, a consensus has yet to develop. Partly this is due to a failure to agree on the ground rules, to which the use of different lenses through which to observe and interpret corporate boards is a contributing factor. This article examines corporate boards through the lens of contract/governance with the object of (1) uncovering the factors that are responsible for the intrinsic limitations of boards in monitoring and managing respects and, in consideration of these limitations, (2) advising on the merits of proposed reforms, to which credibility considerations and the integrity of delegation are relevant. A more accepting interpretation of practices regarded by many as problematic emerges, but not without qualifications and express concern for bad actors. (JEL G30, G34, K22, L14).

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate governance practices of small cap companies have had on their financial performances. Previous studies have mainly examined governance practices of larger corporations. This analysis focuses on the governance variables that have been highlighted by the New Zealand Securities Commission (2004) governance principles and guidelines and also on the governance variables that are supported in the literature as providing an appropriate structure for the firm in the environment in which it operates. The data for 71 small cap companies listed in New Zealand over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005 was analysed. Pooled data, OLS and 2SLS regression techniques were used and Tobin's Q, ROA and OPINC were used as the dependent variables. The evidence does support the hypothesis that the existence of board independence and audit committee has enhanced firm financial performance, as measured by Tobin's Q.

This study investigates demand and supply characteristics associated with firms that voluntarily established audit committees meeting 'best practice' membership guidelines. We focus on a set of best practice criteria rather than on the separate elements of the best practice criteria as in past studies. We conduct our tests using a sample of New Zealand listed companies that, relative to firms in other capital markets, are smaller and have more concentrated ownership. This setting differs from prior research because we expect the costs of voluntarily achieving best practice to be reasonably high. The results show that demand factors are not significantly related to the presence of an audit committee that conforms with best practice membership guidelines. However, supply factors (i.e. those firms with larger and more independent boards) are more likely to form audit committees that meet best practice. These results suggest that compliance costs will be greater for firms with smaller and less independent boards of directors if they are required to comply with best practice requirements.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

The separation of ownership from control in modern corporations has led to some interesting questions and much debate among researchers and practicing managers (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Berle and Means, 1932; Johnson, Daily, and Ellstrand, 1996; Zahra and Pearce, 1989). Individual shareholders, unless they are also managers or hold a large block of stock, have very little influence on the company. Managers, as agents for the shareholders, make most important decisions with regard to corporate operations. Stewardship theory suggests that managers should be given maximum liberty to make decisions so that they are not encumbered by rules and influences that can jeopardize optimal performance (Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson, 1997) However, many researchers and practitioners wonder whether managers can be relied upon to sacrifice their own self-interests and behave in a manner that is in the best interests of the shareholders.

Purpose - Past literature on board research has centred on board structure and firm performance. Since empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between the two, attention has shifted towards board role performance. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper examines three conceptual models for the studying of board role performance: structure, process, and mediation. Findings - Current literature provides little consensus as to the specific configuration for effective board role performance. Originality/value - First, the study examines various aspects of board role performance. This is in contrast with previous research which largely investigates board role performance in general or under the dominant agency perspective which emphasises the board's monitoring role. Second, unlike traditional governance models, the role of board process is explicitly advocated here. Third, the three conceptual models regarding the relationship among board structure, process and performance give an alternative avenue for researchers to explain inconsistencies in past board research. They complement the growing interest in opening up the "black-box" of decision making that has been manifested in studies involving top management teams. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the most popular corporate governance rating systems and to scrutinize their usefulness to shareholders and the public at large. It proposes to examine whether the advertised good governance scores reflect corporate performance, fraud, lawsuits, and the like. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis focused on the methodology used by rating agencies to rank corporate governance practices of companies. Analysis of the categories and variables used in the rating systems were also scrutinized and critiqued. Findings - This research shows that there is a weak relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance rating. Ideas and suggestions have been proposes to remedy the shortfalls of existing rating systems. Research limitations/implications - Many researchers use corporate governance scores in their studies to investigate the relationship between these single scores and corporate performance. Potential vulnerability and risk are demonstrated using such kind of methodologies. Research should be accomplished with the corporate governance indicators separately. Practical implications - Several corporate governance ratings systems have been developed and implemented. These systems reduce a complex corporate governance process and related performance into a single score. Such outcome does not in any way reflect the real nature of corporate governance or its performance. Ranking, if it is at all needed, should be interpreted carefully and not be used as a simple measurement of good or bad corporate governance practice. Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind to critically evaluate corporate governance systems scores launched by different rating agencies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The frequency of earnings restatements has been increasing over the last decade. Restating previous earnings erodes perceived trustworthiness and competence of management, giving firms strong incentives to take actions to enhance perceived credibility of future financial reports [Farber, D. B.: 2005, The Accounting Review 80(2), 539-561.]. Using an experimental case, we examine the ability of post-restatement actions taken by a firm to positively influence non-professional investors' perceptions of management's financial reporting credibility. Our examination considers credibility judgments following two types of restatements - those resulting from fraud in which the character, ethics, and values of an organization may be called into question [cf. Copeland, Jr., J. E.: 2005, Accounting Horizons 19(1), 35-43.], and those resulting from non-fraud (i.e., aggressive accounting). Based on the information in the experimental case, non-professional investors take the role of potential equity investors and make a judgment about management's financial reporting credibility after reviewing a set of post-restatement actions taken by a firm. The possible actions include changes in four corporate governance mechanisms (i.e., internal audit function, external audit firm, board of directors, CFO) and a buyback of company stock. Our results provide an important contribution to the literature by demonstrating that among non-professional investors, perceptions of management's financial reporting credibility are affected both by the post-restatement action taken and the nature of the restatement. These results offer insight into the formation of a key credibility judgment made by non-professional investors following a trust-destroying event, an earnings restatement.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

Corporate scandals due to bad accounting happen far too frequently for a system of corporate governance to be deemed effective. This book tells why the safeguards designed to prevent bad accounting so often fail. By studying why the auditors and members of a board of directors regularly fail to deliver the truth about a company's financial state of affairs, this provocative book explores a serious problem in the system of reporting financial information. This book is unique in that it draws together various strands of the literature on corporate governance, accounting, law, cognitive research, psychology, behavioural economics and conventional economics to shed light on questions regarding the feasibility of independence and impartiality of boards of directors and external auditors as monitors and gatekeepers in corporate governance. The book is essential reading for professional accountants and auditors, directors, regulators, law makers, corporate lawyers, and investment bankers. It will appeal to all those interested in behavioural economics and corporate governance. (c) 2008 Oliver Marnet. All rights reserved.

In light of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the effectiveness of good governance in Asian economies has been a confronting issue. This situation raised the key issue in corporate governance of how to effectively monitor managers and to exercise control so that managers act in the best interest of the shareholders. Amongst others, the existence of a board of directors is an important system for shareholding monitoring and control. This research empirically examines the relationship between board size, percentage of executives and performance of property companies listed in Malaysia. The findings provide evidence that the market seems to have a preference for small boards, but with more executive directors. (c) 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find out whether governance mechanisms approximated by the board of directors' characteristics, auditors' quality, ownership structure and compensation mix, can help bridge the gap between economic value added (EVA) and market values approximated by created shareholder value (CSV). Design/methodology/approach - Based on a sample of US firms and using available data for EVA, discriminant analysis and stepwise regression are used to test whether governance characteristics explain the differences between the results provided by the two measures of performance. Findings - The results show that governance characteristics are important in explaining the differences between the results provided by CSV and EVA and that board independence, the auditors' expertise and reputation, the ownership structure and the stock-options contribute significantly in explaining these differences. Originality/value - The results are very relevant to academicians and practitioners concerned with performance measurement. They basically underline the importance of including governance characteristics in any evaluation formula. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We hypothesize that a top manager's stock ownership in the firm signals to the board information about his or her privately known ability to run the company. As a consequence, the outcome of a CEO succession is affected by the managers' ownership choices, which therefore depend on their career concerns. Research Findings/Results: Our study of CEO turnover events in US firms provides support for our basic hypothesis. Specifically, we find that (1) lower insider ownership makes outside CEO succession more likely; (2) higher ownership by an insider increases his or her chances of promotion; (3) non-appointed managers with higher ownership are more likely to reduce their ownership stake or to leave the firm following CEO succession; and (4) ownership reduction and departure decisions are more likely following outside CEO appointments. Theoretical Implications: Consistent with signaling theory, our analysis suggests that (1) managerial ownership plays a role in resolving asymmetric information problems between top managers and the board of directors in the context of CEO succession, and (2) managers' portfolio decisions and their departure decisions are driven in part by their career opportunities in the firm. Practical Implications: By monitoring managerial ownership decisions surrounding CEO turnover, boards of directors can acquire information about the potential candidates' ability to run the firm and thus better identify the best successor. As managers can more easily signal their information to the board when their ownership choices are observable to the public, security laws that encourage the disclosure of managers' beneficial ownership stakes may increase the efficiency of boards' choices and firm value.

Purpose - This paper seeks to investigate some current issues of ownership structure and corporate governance in China. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is a review, analysing issues of ownership structure and reviewing problems in corporate governance, followed by some suggestions for improvement. Findings - It is found that the heavily concentrated equity ownership in the hands of large state-owned shareholders mainly decides the status quo of the corporate governance system in China. In order to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance of Chinese-listed companies, it is imperative to restructure roles of the government, restrict hands of controlling shareholders, enhance independence of the board of directors, reform the supervisory board, set up independent directors-dominated sub-committees and align the interests of managers with those of the shareholders. Research limitations/implications - This paper only investigates Chinese-listed companies because of data availability. Practical implications - It has implications for policy makers in China insofar as it offers evidence concerning ownership structure and corporate governance of Chinese-listed companies. It also helps investors and trading partners (especially foreign ones) understand corporate governance and the investment environment in China. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by extending the mainly US-based board literature to China where there are important institutional differences in ownership structure and corporate governance system.

In 2004, Spain's Banco Santander purchased Britain's Abbey National Bank in a deal valued at fifteen billion dollars--an acquisition that made Santander one of the ten largest financial institutions in the world. Here, Mauro Guillen and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents.Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guillen and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking.Building a Global Banktells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it.

This study examined the human and social capital factors associated with higher post-succession firm performance in family enterprises in Singapore. We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise. We found that a successor's industry experience and diversity of network ties were positively associated with firm performance and boards that focused their role as advisors to the successor enhanced post-succession firm performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the character of any market response to the appointment of outside directors. The main propositions tested are: whether the stock market responds unconditionally to these appointments or whether the market response is conditional on the degree of the agency problem faced by the firm and the affiliation of the appointees.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a New Zealand sample of the appointments of outside directors during the period from July 1999 to June 2004. The unconditional market response is examined analysing the abnormal returns generated by the appointing companies during the three-day announcement period. The influences of the agency problem and the affiliation of directors are tested by employing multiple regressions.
Findings - The findings provide strong support for the second proposition; the market considers the degree of the agency problem faced by the firm and the affiliation of outside directors in responding to these appointments. The percentage of outside directors in the board emerged as the strongest governance mechanism which, together with firm size, posed a significant inverse influence on announcement period abnormal returns. A strong interaction effect between appointee status and the agency problem was not present.
Originality/value - The mere appointment of outside directors may not please the firm's investors. Such appointments are more useful for companies with severe agency conflicts; even if such a conflict is present, the affiliations that these outside directors have with the executives and the operations of the appointing companies may need to be considered in determining the value of such appointments.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

Theoretically, corporate restructuring is meant to remove firms' operating and financial constraints and improve firm performance. However, corporate restructuring announcement might be interpreted differently by the market. Using event-study method, this study examines the impact of corporate restructuring announcements made by selected firms on their stock prices. Overall, the effect of the restructuring announcements made by these companies on stock prices was significant while the average two years of return on total assets and return on operating cash flow in the post restructuring period were mixed. Evidence also indicates that debt reduction, refocusing and alignment of interest between management and shareholders through board of directors' ownership do not constitute the main focus for some firms in the post restructuring period.

This study examines the association between earnings quality, measured by the timeliness of earnings recognition to the good and bad news, and the composition of the board of directors in the firms listed in Korea Stock Exchange. This study also compares the association between chaebol firms and non-chaebol firms to see if they are different in their outside directors' influce on the timeliness of earnings recognition. Chaebols are usually perceived as family-controlled business groups in Korea, and one of the chaebols' features is that the actual share of the controlling families is quite small. Accordingly, agency problems could be higher for chaebol firms. The board plays an important role in the governance of large corporations. The board monitors and controls the behavior of top management, thereby protecting the interests of shareholders. Although the responsibilities of both inside and outside directors are the same in the Korean Security Laws, Korean Commercial Laws and other related regulations, the governance debate emphasizes more significant contribution outsider directors make in helping to ensure that managers act in the best interests of outside shareholders. This paper tests whether outside directors actually influence the financial reporting process, specifically, whether the timeliness in reported earnings varies with the composition of the board of directors in Korean firms. It is generally recognized that timeliness is one of the key elements in quality financial reporting. Following Basu (1997), this study uses a reverse regression of earnings on shares return to investigate the timeliness in earnings recognition in both good and bad situations. If outsider directors improve earnings quality by mitigating management's discretion to recognize good performance early and hide poor performance late, we can expect firms with relatively high proportion of outside directors to show a lower tendency to accelerate the speed at which good news is reflected in earnings and delay the speed in case of bad news. This study tests the prediction that the reporting of earnings is more timely in case of bad news for firms with a high proportion of outside directors. This study examines the association between the boards of directors and accounting conservatism using a sample of firms listed in Korea Stock Exchange with December year-end between 2001 and 2005. The empirical results indicate that the proportion of non-executive directors is associated with accounting quality as predicted. Specifically, for firms whose proportion of outside directors is above the sample median, this study finds evidence of increased earnings timeliness with respect to bad news, relative to firms whose board composition is below the median. In other words, earnings recognition for firms with below median levels of outsiders is less timely at reflecting bad news. This study also examines the timeliness by dividing the sample firms into chaebol firms and non-chaebol firms. The chaebol families could exercise control over the whole business group while retaining only a small fraction of the equity claims on a company's cash flow. It is expected that the controlling chaebol families could exercise their discretion over financial reporting in the interests of the families rather than in the interests of the majority of the voting shares. They would like to divert the firms' resources from the major voting shareholders to themselves. In such situations, the independent director could play an important role in the financial reporting process so as to protect the majority shareholders. Accordingly, the secured independence of the boards could reduce the chaebol families' discretions over the financial reporting process more effectively than in the case of nonchaebol firms. The result of this paper finds no significant differences between chaebol and non-chaebol in their reporting behaviors with respect to the board independence. The result could be due to the influence of chaebol families on the selection process of outside directors. Overall, the results of this study suggest that firms are likely to be more conservative when recognizing bad news in their earnings especially if they have more outside representation on their board. This is the case not only in non-chaebol firms but also in chaebol firms. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, this study provides evidence on the extent to which extant US findings can be generalized to a different governance and financial reporting regime by examining the association between board independence and earnings quality in a Korean setting. Second, this study finds that separating good and bad news is important to understand the way boards have impact on earnings timeliness. Finally, the results of this study suggest that greater outside board membership may be important in ensuring accounting quality, not only for the non-chaebol firms but also for the chaebol firms, thereby providing a rationale for the policy initiatives that have occurred over the past few years about the reform of the corporate governance structure.

In focus of this paper are selected characteristics of enterprise boards and their influences on performance in companies located in Gnosjo, one of Sweden's best known industrial districts. The aim and contribution of this paper are to propose and test a model that reflects how the relationship between board characteristics, administration and company age can have an effect on company performance. Our results show that number of commitments among board members as well as company age are significant for company performance measured with sales and sales per employee. The support of the model proposed is strong and we believe the results have practical as well as theoretical implications. (c) Ossi Pesamaa, Johan Klaesson, Antti Haahti, 2008.

Since the MM theory, scholars have discussed capital structure issues from the perspectives of agency problems in corporate governance. Corporate governance has been seen as the means to reducing the agency costs produced by aligning the interests of management and shareholders, and the incentive for the management to engage in opportunistic behavior has been influenced by the firm's ownership and board of director structures. Previous studies, however, focus on traditional financial factors and neglect the debt and equity agency problems triggered by corporate governance and their possible influences on capital structure decisions. The sample used in this study consists of 317 firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1998 to 2007. By controlling for the heterogeneity of industries and firm size, our models incorporate the cash flow rights-voting rights-seat control divergence, the ownership structure, and the structure of the board of directors to examine the effects of corporate governance on the firm's capital structure. The results show that, when the divergence between cash flow rights and seat control is lower or when the divergence between voting rights and seat control is higher, the controlling shareholders can either control the board of directors to better monitor the firm or exhibit a preference for debt financing based on entrenchment motives. Further analysis indicates that blockholders prefer lower debt financing and do not expropriate minority shareholders. Financial institutional shareholders function through their provision of monitoring and the certification of debts for technological firms and can decrease the firms' debts. The management in the technological industry firms prefers debt financing in order to obtain agency-related benefits. While directors in traditional industries or large firms might use personal or firm debt to tunnel the firm's assets, the function of independent directors in technological firms or large firms of lowering debts in order to reduce the firm's bankruptcy risks is more evident.

In light of the best practice recommendations released by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March 2003, this study tests the relationship between initial public offering (IPO) firm performance and board governance quality, captured by board size, board leadership, board composition, and director"s share ownership. Based on a sample of Australian IPO firms that lodged prospectuses with ASX between 1994 and 1999, we do not find evidence that links underpricing to board structures at the time of IPO. IPO firms' board structures are insignificant in explaining the level of IPO underpricing, and board size is the only board governance variable significant in explaining long-run aftermarket performance, after controlling for the size of the firm. That is, IPO firms with larger boards at the time of issuance perform better in the long-run, consistent with the resource dependence theory. Thus, we conclude that ASX"s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place, and our findings lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality.

Despite intensive efforts to determine the nature of the relationship between the firm size and the level of voluntary disclosure (VDI), empirical studies of this issue have produced mixed results. This paper attempts to delve deeper into this complex phenomenon by employing a resource dependency perspective to hypothesize a model of mediation as board of directors' quality index (BOQI) is moderated by a high concentration of CEO's ownership (HCEO). The findings suggest that the larger firm size, the higher is the BOQI and this in turn will lead to the higher VDI. These relationships appear to be weaker when there is moderation as HCEO, produced by the mediation process of the BOQI, and when this process is controlled, the residual moderation of the treatment effect is reduced. Further, board size as control variable is found to have a positive significant influence on BOQI and VDI.

The resolution of conflicts between shareholders and managers, at minimal cost, is the goal of corporate governance. This paper discusses four mechanisms, two internal, two external, that attempt to ensure managers act in the best interests of shareholders: 1) the board of directors, 2) management compensation plans, 3) the market, and 4) takeovers. Theoretically, these four forms of corporate governance should ensure management maximizes shareholder value. But, agency costs are real for shareholders. In practice each the mechanisms may be severely limited in their ability to protect shareholders. The best protection is an independent, credible board of directors. Without good boards, shareholders are left to the mercy of the agents. In such cases, it is very difficult, and expensive, to discipline the senior managers of a publicly-traded company.

Since entrenchment strategy has a real impact on performance, we examine in this paper the relationship between entrenchment and performance. This study is based on cross-section data of 21 quoted Tunisian companies (from both manufacturing and service sector) over the period 2000 to 2006. Our evidence contributes to understanding the role played by several entrenchment pathways, such as the ownership structure, the debt policy and the structure of the board of directors. In this paper, we aim to shed light on these governance's features by indicating by which channel entrenchment strategy is carried out in Tunisian companies.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of the characteristics related to the ownership structure and board of directors, as mechanisms of governance, on the research and development (R&D) intensity. The study carried out on a sample of French companies belonging to the SBF 250 index shows that ownership concentration and duality of chief executive officer and chairman roles have no significant effect on the R & D intensity. The board sizes as well as the proportion of inside directors in the board have a positive and significant effect on R & D intensity. However, the participation of outside directors in capital tends to urge managers to reduce R&D investment level.

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the intensity of board activity, as represented by board meeting frequency, and firm financial performance, using data from the top 500 Australian companies. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return; several control variables are introduced in the analysis. The results indicate that board meeting frequency has a positive impact on subsequent shareholder return. Regarding the explanatory factors for the level of board activity, it is reported that firms with more board committees tend to have relatively more board and committee meetings; firms with larger boards have less board meetings. In addition, lower managerial ownership leads to more committee meetings.

In recent years, considerable concerns have arisen over the issue of corporate governance in banks' supervision. One of the major issues has been investigated whether the sound mechanism of corporate governance benefits bank risk management and performance. The collateralized shares, serving stocks as collaterals, are one of financial leverage approaches and it is likely to be an incentive for block shareholders to misapply assets due to the deviation between the controlship and the ownership. The objective of this study is to examine whether the attitude of the board of directors toward risk will affect the bank risk and performance. Quarterly data of commercial banks listed either on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or GreTai Securities Market from 1999 to 2007 are examined in this study. The results show that the collateralized shares may have contributed to a lower return due to a higher risk and they are in line with previous studies our results are in line with previous researches. In conclusion, the monitoring mechanism should enforce relatively regulations more strictly to avoid the agency problems. Especially to the insiders of influence such as board of directors or block shareholders, more strictly regulations and the disclosure of relatively information should be necessary. The result will be expected to lead to better understanding of the nature of the collateralized shares and laying the groundwork for realizing that is the collateralized shares worth monitoring. It may provide policy implication for the regulators in the later monitoring requirement.

The sugar industry remains a priority for development in the Indonesian agricultural sector, especially in East Java. However, the performance of the sugar industry in East Java during the two last decades has declined, which is shown in the decreasing volume of production. This study utilized the analysis of transaction cost economics to identify the problems of the sugar mills in East Java - Indonesia. This research compares the transaction costs between state-owned (Ngadiredjo) and privately-owned (Kebon Agung) sugar mills. The study shows that in Kebon Agung Sugar Mill transaction costs are higher than production costs, while in Ngadiredjo Sugar Mill the reverse is true. However, the high transaction costs in Kebon Agung Sugar Mill cannot be attributed directly to inefficient institutions, because Ngadiredjo Sugar Mill incurred high costs for plants, land preparation, and fertilizer, which decreased the proportion of transaction costs. If analyzed in detail, the following facts are revealed: (i) market transaction costs in Kebon Agung Sugar Mill are higher than in Ngadiredjo Sugar Mill. This is because Kebon Agung Sugar Mill has established cooperation with sugarcane farmers in the form of extensions and transport subsidies; and (ii) the political transaction costs proportion in Ngadiredjo Sugar Mill is higher than in Kebon Agung Sugar Mill because of the imposition of many 'illegal' fees. There should be management (corporate) reform of sugar mills, both internal and external. Internally, sugar mill management must apply good corporate governance that guarantees the transparency and control of every activity. Nowadays, there is no controlling unit in sugar mill management that supervises corporate activity, so that it is susceptible to manipulation and mark-up. Externally, the relationship between sugar mill management (CEO) and the Board of Directors should be reformulated so that sugar mill management has wide authority to make corporate strategy decisions. Centralization of authority in holding firm (PTPN/PT. RNI) has caused high transaction costs as a result of the long hierarchy in decision-making.

In this study, we examine how multiple directorships held by outside directors (busy outside directors) influence shareholder wealth in diversifying acquisitions. With a sample of 893 diversifying acquisitions from 1998 to 2004, we find a negative (positive) busy-director effect for diversifying acquisitions of public-targets (private-targets). Busy directors are negatively (positively) associated with the five-day cumulative abnormal returns in acquisitions involving public (private) targets, where merger-related agency problems are more likely. Our evidence support the notion that, in the case of diversifying acquisitions, increased managerial monitoring plays a more important role versus enhanced advising and business connection from busy directors.

In this paper several theories, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm performance, are tested. The results indicate that, for Australian listed companies, there is no strong relationship between leadership structure and subsequent performance. It is reported that companies with higher blockholder ownership or lower managerial shareholdings tend to have an affiliated chairman; firm with higher managerial shareholdings tend to have an executive chairman. The evidence suggests that there is no one optimal leadership structure; each structure, which could be an outcome of a rational choice process influenced by other governance characteristics of individual firms, may have associated costs and benefits.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The goal of this paper is to meta-analyze the results of 35 studies that examine the effect on earnings management of firms' boards of directors and ownership structure. We examine whether differences in results are attributable to moderating effects related to the system of corporate governance, the measurement of the governance variable, or the particular specifications of discretionary accruals models. Research Findings/Insights: The findings show that the variation in the results of previous studies on CEO duality and audit committee independence are caused by sampling error. In addition, the measurement of dependent variable, discretionary accruals, and the corporate governance system moderate the association between earnings management and some corporate governance variables. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The measurement of variables, especially discretionary accruals, influences the findings found in previous studies. The findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the legal and institutional setting when one analyzes the effect of mechanisms of corporate governance on discretionary accruals. Future research should include matrix correlations, and consider detailed measures of earnings management and more attributes of boards of directors in order to facilitate research using meta-analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results suggest that board independence, board size, and audit committee independence can improve investor confidence by constraining earnings management. Additional empirical evidence regarding refined measures of ownership and board, specifically board independence, would be very useful in gaining greater understanding of how the different approaches to these constructs influence earnings management.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Convergence in corporate governance across countries has been a subject of interest and controversy in a variety of disciplines. We attempt to address a number of related research questions: (1) what constitutes convergence? (2) what are the drivers that propel corporations in different nations towards convergence? (3) what are the major impediments that stand in the way of convergence? (4) what empirical evidence do we have to suggest that we are moving towards or away from convergence? and (5) what would be some productive avenues for further research on this topic? Research Findings/Results: Despite the vigorous intellectual position of the proponents of convergence, there is only limited evidence to indicate that such convergence is actually occurring. Even when there is ostensible convergence, much of it is convergence in form rather than substance, and governance convergence is not a context-free phenomenon. Theoretical Implications: Our review of the past literature suggests that increasing integration of product and capital markets is leading to changes in corporate governance around the world, but there is only limited evidence that such changes constitute convergence. Governance changes seem to be primarily attributable to the quest for greater efficiency in governance and enhanced legitimacy in capital markets. However, local forces such as institutional embeddedness and politics can hinder governance changes or create "hybrid" practices. Practical Implications: The ideal corporate governance may be institution- and firm-specific and an imposition of new practices or standards may not lead to intended policy or performance outcomes.

This study contributes to the debate on the benefits and costs of multiple directorships by investigating the impact of multiple directorships on board meeting attendance. Individuals with multiple board seats (or "busy" directors) exhibit a higher tendency to be absent from board meetings. The results are robust even after controlling for firm-specific characteristics, board of directors structure and endogeneity. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that directors with higher ownership stakes are more motivated to attend board meetings. Monetary inducements such as board meeting fees and annual director retainers do not appear to enhance attendance. Finally, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) appears to have a material impact on board attendance. (c) 2008 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board size and performance in a sample of 174 bank and savings-and-loan holding companies, over the period 1995-2002. Design/methodology/approach: In order to examine the relationship between board of directors' size and performance in the banking industry, the paper uses various statistical tools, including panel univariate analyses and panel data techniques. Findings: Contrary to theories predicting that smaller boards of directors are more effective, increasing the number of directors in banking firms does not undermine performance. In contrast, the evidence is in favor of a positive relationship between board size and performance, as measured by Tobin's Q and the return on assets. The paper investigates whether this positive association is due to the fact that banks reduce the number of their directors in the aftermath of poor performance by testing for the relationship between board size and performance. The findings show that the number of directors leaving the board and the number of those joining the board for the first time increase following a poor performance, but the net change in board size is not affected by past performance. Research limitations/implications: The paper recognizes that a number of factors that are not controlled for in this study might be behind the positive empirical association between board size and the performance measures used. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that the calls to reduce the number of directors in banks might have adverse effects on performance. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the banking literature by investigating the relationship between an important governance mechanism, the board of directors, and performance in banking firms.

This paper applies a two-stage, double bootstrapping data envelope analysis approach to investigate whether and to what extent various distinctive corporate governance practices affect productive efficiency in a sample of 461 publicly listed manufacturing firms in China between 1999 and 2002. We find that firm efficiency is negatively related to state ownership while positively related to public and employee share ownership. In addition, the relationship between ownership concentration and firm efficiency is U-shaped, indicating the presence of tunneling activities by the largest shareholder. Among three types of controlling shareholder, state exerts the most negative impact on firm efficiency, followed by state-owned legal entities. These results provide strong evidence that political interferences have reduced firm efficiency. It shows that the proportion of outside directors and the number of board meetings are positively associated with firm efficiency, suggesting that board of directors can be an effective internal governance mechanism. Furthermore, provincial market development, a proxy for the strength of external governance mechanism, is positively related to firm efficiency. Overall, our findings illustrate that restructuring state-owned enterprises via improvements in corporate governance has enhanced firm efficiency, but partial privatization without transfer of ownership and control from the state to the public remains a major source of inefficiency in corporate China.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board diversity, as represented by the percentage of female, minority or female and minority directors on the boards of directors, and firm financial performance, and to explore the potential determinants of board diversity, using data from the Australian corporate sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the top 500 Australian companies as the initial data-set. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate that gender and racial diversity do not have significant influence on performance. It is reported that larger firms tend to have relatively more female members, and smaller firms or firms with larger boards may have more minority directors. Research limitations/implications - The findings should not be extrapolated to all firms as the sample is restricted to listed companies. To examine the complete impact of board diversity future research could consider non-financial performance indicators. Practical implications - The analysis shows that greater diversity does not lead to poor performance, which suggests that gender and racial diversity could be achieved without a negative effect on shareholder wealth. Originality/value - In addition to giving improved evidence on the effect of gender diversity on performance, the paper may be the first study which ascertains whether there is a "business case" for greater minority participation in boardrooms in the Australian context.

The agency problem of listed companies in East Asia is closely related to their typically concentrated ownership structures. Tight control creates an entrenchment problem that allows the controlling owners' self-interested behaviors to go unchallenged internally by the boards of directors or externally by takeover markets. The primary objective of this paper is to explore the association between the ownership and control structure and innovation. The ownership and control structure is measured first as the divergence between the ultimate owner's voting rights and the ultimate owner's cash flow rights, and second by the presence of ultimately controlling shareholder's family member as CEO or Chairman of the board, or both. Innovation is measured by patent quantity and patent quality. This paper uses patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to measure innovation activities. We find that innovation is significantly and negatively related to the level of agency problems. We further find that innovation is lower for firms whose controlling owner is also either the chief executive officer or the chair of the board of directors. Our findings appear to be robust with respect to examining patent count and patent quality variables.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the number of outside directors on the board of directors and dividend payout are substitutes or complements mechanisms applied by UK firms to control agency conflicts of interest within the firm. Design-methodology-approach The authors use tobit and logit regression models to examine the extent to which firms with a majority of outside directors on their boards experience significantly lower or higher dividend payout after controlling for insider ownership, profitability, liquidity, asset structure, business risk, firm size, firms' growth rate and borrowing ratio. Findings Based on a sample of 400 non-financial firms listed at London Stock Exchange for the period from 1991 to 2002, it was found that dividend payout is negatively associated with the number of outside directors on the board of directors. Originality-value The results suggest that firms pay lower dividends when higher number of outside directors is employed on the board. This evidence is consistent with the substitution hypothesis, which indicated that firms with weak corporate governance need to establish a reputation by paying dividends. In other words, dividends substitute for independent directors on the board. This finding offers novel insights to policy makers interested in agency conflicts of interest within the firm. It also provides evidence on the use of different substitute mechanisms for reducing agency costs. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the association between the composition of the board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Results: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition - board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition - the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical Implications: The results provide support for the managerial hegemony and the resource dependency theories. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by interlocking directors with extra-industry ties. Practical Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. Interlocking directors appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification. Existing recommendations and regulations to align management with shareholders' interests through independent boards should be revised. Board composition should also consider directors' knowledge, relevant expertise, availability, and length of tenure. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study empirically explores whether, and how, selected attributes of China's two-tier board system affect Chinese frms' performance and earnings informativeness. Using a database of 4,623 frm-year observations over the 1999 to 2003 period, we fnd some effects that mirror ones reported in non-Chinese settings, such as positive correlations between frm performance and the proportion of independent board of directors members (BoD) and the frequency of supervisory committee (SC) meetings; as well as positive correlations between earnings informativeness and the proportions of independent BoD and SC members. These exploratory fndings provide impetus for further research in the Chinese setting.

We study going-concern (GC) reporting in Belgium to examine the effects associated with a shift toward rules-based audit standards. Beginning in 2000, a major revision in Belgian GC audit standards took effect. Among its changes, auditors must ascertain whether their clients are in compliance with two "financial-juridical criteria" for board of directors' GC disclosures. In a study of a sample of private Belgian companies, we report two major findings. First, there is a decrease in auditor Type II errors, particularly by non-Big 6/5 auditors for their clients that fail both criteria. Second, there is an increase in Type I errors, again particularly for companies that fail both criteria. We also conduct an ex post analysis of the decrease in Type II errors and the increase in Type I errors. Our findings suggest the standard engenders both favorable and unfavorable effects, the net of which depends on the priorities assigned to the affected parties (creditors, auditors, companies, and employees).

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

This conceptual paper analyses why some companies in Russia give strong weight to the external roles and some to the internal roles of the boards of directors. The institutional background of Russian corporate governance is reviewed, concentrating on the contextual variables of time of founding, ownership type and governmental dependency, which are seen to explain the varying weight given to internal and external board roles. After arriving at several propositions, the paper finishes with suggestions for an empirical evaluation of the proposed relationships and addresses several managerial implications that stem from the discussion. This paper addresses the under-researched field of contingencies in board roles, focusing on Russia and emphasizing the importance of the prevailing institutional framework in transition economies.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study examines whether a firm's corporate governance system, particularly with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors and senior management, affects how accurately the impact of accounting changes is reported to shareholders. We concentrate on the relation between corporate governance measures and accounting forecast errors that arise with adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards by listed Australian firms. Evidence reveals that corporate governance mechanisms are associated with the likelihood and magnitude of managerial forecast errors. (c) 2008 Accounting Foundation.

This paper investigates the association between corporate performance and the probability of chief executive officer (CEO) dismissal for large corporations in Australia. Consistent with prior US and UK studies, corporate performance is negatively related to the probability of CEO dismissal, using both accounting and market-based performance measures. This paper also investigates whether key corporate governance characteristics affect the likelihood of CEO dismissal, by examining their effect on the strength of the negative association between corporate performance and CEO dismissal. The only significant variable is size of the board. Although its effect is opposite to that hypothesized, this paper provides a plausible explanation. Overall, the results are consistent with shareholder wealth considerations dominating board behaviour in Australia. (c) 2009 AFAANZ.

By employing the theoretical template provided by agency theory, this article contributes a detailed clinical analysis of a large multinational Canada-headquartered telecommunications company, Nortel. Our analysis reveals a twenty-first century norm of usual suspects: a CEO whose compensation is well above those of his peers, a dysfunctional board of directors, acts of income smoothing to preserve the confidence of volatile investors, and revelations of financial irregularities followed by a downfall. In many ways, the spectacular rise and - sudden - fall of Nortel illustrates excesses of actors within, and contradictions of the system of corporate governance implied by the agency model. Furthermore, this case illustrates limitations of the agency framework in complex situations with short-term oriented investors. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate, using data on US manufacturing firms, how and when corporate governance affects managers' decisions to use discretionary accruals and thereby artificially influence company financial reports. Design/methodology/approach - Three-stage least squares is employed to study the relationship between financial status, corporate governance and financial reporting discretion. The sample spans the years 2001-2003 during a severe downturn in the US stock market. Financial status is measured with the Altman Z-score. Findings - A significant difference is found between firms not classified as healthy or failed (i.e. the mid-range group) and the two extreme categories when examining governance quotient using a well-known index. A positive relationship is found between discretionary accruals and the governance index. Strong governance appears to reduce the incidence of mid-range firms engaging in accruals management. The least healthy and the most distressed companies have the weakest relationship with discretionary accruals. By contrast, mid-range firms are more likely to resort to discretionary accruals. Practical implications - Non-executive members of boards of directors are warned to be particularly vigilant about discretionary accruals with firms transitioning between healthy and high-failure risk. Originality/value - The relationship between firms' financial health and discretionary accruals reveals an agency problem in credit markets with financially stressed firms. More attention is required on firms whose financial condition is uncertain. Also, it is documented that significant findings of importance to the earnings quality and corporate governance literature by documenting the role of corporate governance on discretionary accruals and financial status.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the corporate governance mechanisms in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico during the period of 2000-2002. This work contributes to the corporate governance literature examining empirical evidence in the Latin American context, where corporate governance mechanisms and ownership structures have distinguished characteristics. Apparently corporate governance mechanisms designed to protect minority shareholders may not be present in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico during the years studied, despite the current efforts to enhance such practices in global equity markets.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which stock market valuation and managerial incentives jointly affect merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions and postM&A performance, and to provide new evidence on the agency implications where such acquisitions are driven by the stock market. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing all publiclytraded US firms in the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ during the period from 1992 to 2005 (excluding financial and utility firms), obtained from COMPUSTAT, CRSP, I/B/E/S, and the M&A database provided by SDC Platinum, this paper adopts a twostage approach: the first stage, predicts the probability of an M&A based on the market valuation variables; the second stage, regresses the postM&A firm performance on the predicted probability of a merger or acquisition from the first stage and other control variables. Findings Market valuation has a significant influence on corporate acquisition decisions, particularly for those firms whose compensation packages include less managerial equity ownership, more executive stock options and no longterm incentive plans, and in those firms where CEOs are serving on the board of directors. The valuedestroying acquisitions made by these types of managers are likely to be financed using the firms' stocks, executed with high premiums and undertaken during periods of high market valuation. Originality/value The main finding suggests that marketdriven acquisitions could be value destroying when managers engage in opportunistic acquisitions for reasons of selfinterest. Managerial myopia, overconfidence, misaligned incentives, empirebuilding motives and poor corporate governance can all exacerbate the agency problem of marketdriven acquisitions.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the response in the UK, the USA and China to the need to provide effective protection in law to disgruntled minority shareholders. Design/methodology/approach - The study draws upon official comment and case law across the three jurisdictions in order to assess the scope and availability of minority actions. Findings - The importance of shareholder rights through alternative actions is an important aspect of controlling the behaviour and actions of the Board of Directors and an important part of corporate governance. This paper seeks to compare the development and scope of derivative rights in the UK, the USA and in China and provides an assessment and insight into the differences in approach and in the political and legal structures with the consequent likely impact on the role and contribution of derivative claims in the control and governance of Boards in the different jurisdictions.

Combining human capital theory and equity theory, we developed and tested a model in which the outside directors' total cash compensation is related to the outsider's profile, as well as to the board and firm characteristics. Consistent with our model, characteristics of the outsider's profile, in terms of his/her role and responsibility, meeting activities and length of service, are relevant. Only the director's popularity, as a part of his/her human capital, has a significant effect on his/her compensation. Our empirical results confirm the necessity to create a stronger link between the remuneration policies of the outsider directors and their contribution in a board, in terms of human capital. The remuneration policies adopted by firms should be linked to practices on corporate governance useful for helping outsiders contribute confidently to their work of the board and receive ongoing support and information so they can develop their understanding of the total environment within they work. Then, we suggest having recourse to qualifications and professional skills as well as to specific training or board induction programmes defined by firms themselves. Finally, the Combined Code should promote the adoption and spreading of such practices on market. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.

Golden parachutes are often viewed as a form of excessive compensation because they provide senior management with substantial payouts following an acquisition while other stakeholders are subjected to layoffs, disrupted business relationships and other negative externalities. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms, an economic and ethical justification for this type of contract is given. Golden parachutes ensure effective corporate governance that, in turn, preserve the firm's value for all stakeholders. Boards of directors enter into parachute agreements to protect recently hired CEOs' human capital during periods of financial uncertainty and, thus, potential takeover activity. From an ethics viewpoint, golden parachutes are valuable to all stakeholders because they encourage merger or acquisition in lieu of bankruptcy. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study aims to evaluate the suitability of Taiwan's minimum shareholding requirement for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to examine whether stewardship theory and both incentive and entrenchment effects can characterize the ownership-performance relationship simultaneously. Research Findings/Results: We apply new empirical methods to a balanced panel dataset including 496 firm-level observations of 62 Taiwanese SMEs publicly traded from 1999 to 2006. The results show a nonlinear ownership-performance relationship, first negative then positive, with a single threshold value of insider ownership (5.4 per cent). This indicates that both effects combine and that the current regulated minimum level of insider shareholdings for public SMEs may be too high. Theoretical Implications: Our evidence supports both convergence-of-interests and entrenchment effects and suggests a better specification that prevents spurious relations obtained from traditional methods. The stewardship theory does work in Taiwan. Insiders behave as loyal stewards rather than motivated by desire for entrenchment. Our empirical evidence suggests an avenue of future research, specifically to form better strategies for those involved in corporate governance. Practical Implications: We suggest that Taiwanese authorities should lessen ownership obligations, thereby leading to improved corporate governance by increasing the independence of the boards of directors. Emerging markets can learn from the Taiwan experience and then formulate their own regulations. Publicly traded SMEs could offer compensation to insiders such as stock options and performance shares. Asymmetric information problems often experienced by outside stockholders and foreign investors can be alleviated by these signals of insider ownership. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This chapter analyzes corporate governance systems in five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela. We account for the broader institutional environment by explaining changes over time as well as existing corporate governance systems. We use a stakeholder definition of corporate governance that includes examining insiders such as owners and boards of directors as well as outsiders such as employees. This corporate governance perspective allows for a systematic cross-national comparison. There exists an extensive literature on the Anglo-American corporate governance system, particularly from the finance field (e.g., Shleifer & Vishny, 1997; Keasey, Thompson, & Wright, 1999) as well as on comparative corporate governance among industrialized countries (e.g., Prowse, 1995; Rhodes & van Apeldoorn, 1998; Weimer & Pape, 1990; AMR special issue on corporate governance, 2003; Grandori, 2004; Gospel & Pendleton, 2005; Aguilera, Filatotchev, Gospel, & Jackson,2008). There have also been some comparative corporate governance studies on eastern Europe (e.g., Federowicz & Aguilera, 2003) and east Asia (e.g., OECD, 2001; Zhuang & Edwards, 2001; Jacoby, 2004). This chapter seeks to fill a gap in comparative corporate governance research by systematically analyzing the main corporate governance characteristics in the five largest countries in Latin America1. Little comparative corporate governance research has been done on this region of the world despite its geographic importance and recent economic interest in creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Studies of corporate governance examine how the rights and responsibilities within firms are distributed (Aguilera & Jackson, 2003). The institutions of corporate governance are key factors in the long-term economic development of a country. These institutions have two main objectives: to stimulate the performance of corporations through a business environment that motivates productivity and to ensure corporate conformance between the interests of investors and society (Oman, 2003). Several scholars have discussed the positive relationship between effective national corporate governance systems and firm performance in emerging markets. For example, Klapper and Love (2002) demonstrate that efficient governance is highly correlated with better operating performance and market valuation, and Doidge, Karalyi, and Stulz (2004) show how country characteristics are key explanatory variables in governance ratings across firms in less-developed countries as opposed to firm characteristics in developed countries. This chapter examines the largest and most productive five countries of South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela). These are developing economies that have in common a tumultuous political and economic history of dictatorships and economic crises. Yet, these countries are in the process of modernizing their corporate governance systems, either as a condition in continuing to receive international aid or simply as a strategy to attract more foreign direct investment. The comparative nature of this chapter allows us to tackle indirectly an important debate within corporate governance, that is, whether there is a convergence toward the Anglo-American model (Hansmann & Kraakman, 2001; Thomsen, 2004). This question has been addressed for transition economies such as Eastern Europe (Aguilera & Dabu, 2005), and more generally emerging markets. For example, an empirical analysis of 24 emerging countries by Khanna, Kogan, and Palepu (2002) indicates that corporate governance convergence is not imminent, although there is as yet no general consensus. Our chapter contributes to this debate by showing that, indeed, there is not full convergence as Latin American countries modernize their corporate governance system. In this chapter, we first review the main political and economic trends of each of the five countries. This might seem unconventional for a study of corporate governance but since these five countries are in emerging markets, we believe it is particularly relevant to stress their broader political and economic conditions that undoubtedly shape their respective corporate governance patterns. Second, we systematically compare different aspects that define the systems of corporate governance in these countries. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

Based on the Knowledge Production Function framework given by Griliches (1979), we slightly modify it so that the innovative output depends upon a set of fa ctors related to the firm internal characteristics and are influenced by the environment. Specifically, regarding the firm internal determinants the effect of the concentration of the ownership, the composition of the boards of directors and the effect of the nature of the ownership (foreign and public) are analyzed. Additionally, in order to capture the determinants of the environment in which the firm operates other variables concerning the internationalization of market, the agglomeration economies and the regional knowledge externalities are also considered. In order to assess the impact of these determinants on the number of patents and models of use awarded by the firm, the discreteness of the latter variable has to be taken into account. We apply Poison and Negative Binomial models for a more comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis in a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms. The results show patenting activity is positively favoured by being located in an environment with a high innovative activity, due to the existence of knowledge spillovers and agglomeration economies.

The agency- and stewardship theory attach great importance to the implementation of audit committees in the one tier- and two tier system. The mentioned theories can explain the corporate governance function of audit committees. In order to strengthen corporate governance, the job specification emphasises the independence and financial expertise of the committee's members. The present article provides an overview of the historical development of audit committees and their normative affiliation in the German stock corporation law (two tier system). Moreover, their role as representatives of the one tier system in the US American capital market is being addressed. The results suggest more restrictive standards regarding the implementation and job specification of the audit committee at the US stock exchange (Sarbanes Oxley Act; New York Stock Exchange [NYSE], National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations [NASDAQ]) than in the German stock corporation law (including the German corporate governance code). In addition to the normative analysis, the present paper provides a summary of results of existing, primarily US American empirical research with regard to the influence of audit committees on selected corporate governance indicators. The results show that the vast majority of the respective studies prove a significant correlation between audit committees and the restriction of earnings management, the identification and prevention of management failures and fraud with regard to the balance sheet, the external management reporting as well as the quality of the external audit. As a consequence of differing corporate governance systems, the results of the US American corporate governance studies can be applied only to a limited extend to the German two tier system. Monitoring by the capital market is even lower in Germany. In support of the respective empirical results and in order to strengthen corporate governance in the one tier system, future research is needed regarding the implementation of audit committees in the German two tier system.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

This paper examines the place of payout policies in governance systems. It analyses the conditions in which payout is used to regulate agency conflicts and studies the relations between dividend or share repurchase and the other governance mechanisms. Through the study of 167 French firms from 2000 to 2005, the author shows that in France payout is not used to regulate conflicts between majority and minority shareholders, but rather to limit free cash flow risk or conflict between managers and shareholders. In presence of a majority shareholder, the governance systems do not achieve in forcing insiders to disgorge cash. The study confirms the substitutability between debt and payout and shows that blockholders have an effect on payout. On the contrary, the board's characteristics, except the directors' independence, do not influence payout. Copyright (c) 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines the cross-sectional relation between corporate governance and corporate performance of the sample of 12 Chinese banks over the 2003-2006 periods. Taking other influential factors into account, such as the capital adequacy ratio and the firm size, this study investigates the influence of state ownership and outside directors on bank performance, measured by return on equity and non-performing loans ratio. The two ratios are chosen to evaluate the financial performance of a bank in terms of its profitability and the soundness of its operating revenue management. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship between corporate governance and bank performance. More specifically, the fraction of shares owned by the state has significant and negative effects on bank performance and the proportion of outside directors on the board of directors has positive effects on bank performance.

I propose a model of mergers in which synergies and CEO power play a crucial role. A merger is modeled as a bargaininggame between the acquiring and the target board of directors, with the gains from a merger divided according to the generalized Nash bargaining solution. The model's implications are consistent with the available empirical evidence on stock returns, and yield some new untested implications that are mainly related to the relationship between CEO power, corporate governance, and mergers. Finally, the model sheds light on the relationship between aggregate merger activity, synergies, and CEO power. (c) 2009 Mohr Siebeck.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA; evaluate the corporate governance alternatives to "sayonpay" legislation; recommend a policy encouraging enhanced executive accountability; and suggest research questions pertaining to "sayonpay" proposals and executive compensation for scholars to pursue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes an exploratory approach to discussing and analyzing the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA and offering an alternative corporate governance approach to enhancing executive performance. Findings - The paper finds that whether an annual nonbinding "sayonpay" policy is instituted or not within a company is not the crux of the executive compensation issue. What is important is whether concerned shareholders have the ability to have proxy access and successfully pass such a resolution, thereby exercising shareholder pressure on the board of directors to implement a corporate policy of equating appropriate executive compensation with managerial performance. Moreover, this improvement in boardshareowner engagement, along with expanded disclosure of executive compensation packages, will assist in obviating the need for the exercise of a draconian shareholder resolution to remove directors. Originality/value - This paper offers an indepth review of the "sayonpay" legislative and corporate governance controversy; places the issue in the context of effective corporate governance; recommends a reasoned approach to executive compensation accountability; and offers a list of research questions for corporate governance and human resource management scholars to pursue.

How does the development of financial markets change the interaction between banks and corporations? This paper compares the importance of interlocking boards of directors between corporations and banks in Brazil, Mexico and the United States circa 1909. The hypothesis tested is that the development of financial markets and the institutions that accompany it (e.g. financial disclosure rules, investor protections, etc.) allows corporations to rely less on connections to banks. First, given the development of disclosure and corporate governance standards in Brazil, I expect bankers to have been less central than in Mexico and, perhaps, the United States. Second, I test whether the availability of financing alternatives, like a well developed bond market in Brazil, reduced the average importance of corporate connections to commercial banks compared to Mexico. I test these hypotheses using network analysis and a simple multivariate regression that explains bank connections. I use comparable business directories to create data bases with names of directors and financial information for all major corporations in Mexico and Brazil in 1909. The findings show that using different centrality measures, connections between banks and corporations were less important in Brazil than in Mexico and the United States. Also, in Brazil, the availability of bonds as a way to obtain financing allowed corporations to have a lower average number of connections to banks when compared to their Mexican counterparts. In Mexico, foreign companies, which had access to financial markets abroad, had also lower average connections with banks. I conclude by arguing that even though Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. had very different network structures, rapid industrial growth was achieved by these three countries. In Mexico, a strong and dense network replaced for some of the institutions that promoted financial development and growth in Brazil. (c) Editions ESKA, 2009.

This paper analyzes the effects of firm performance and governance factors on the decrease in diversification of Japanese firms in the 1990s. We focus on the cases of the decrease in diversification, because many previous studies proved that diversification caused firm value discount. Adjusting an excessive unrelated diversification would be an important topic, because the problems of low synergy between business units, inefficiency in management and so on were more serious in this type of diversification. The findings of this study are as follows. In the first half of the 1990s, immediately after the collapse of bubble economy, lower firm performance and main bank relationship encouraged firms to decrease the level of diversification of their businesses. On the other hand, in the latter half of the 1990s when the decrease in diversification itself was activated, higher performing non-manufacturing firms and manufacturing firms with lower profitability but facing higher growth in their main business tried to decrease diversification in order to strengthen the competitiveness in main businesses. Also, this kind of decrease in diversification was supported by the governance characteristics such as insider majority smaller boards of directors and the pressure from capital market.

Using a corporate governance scorecard (Corp-Gov Score) measuring twenty-six areas of corporate governance best practices in four UK banks, this study examined whether improved levels of corporate governance led to higher levels of firm performance within the UK banking industry over the time period 1999-2006. The twenty-six measures were split into four sub-sector areas of Corp-Gov Score comprising Board of Directors, Remuneration Policies, Auditing Policies, and Transparency/Disclosure Policies. Using both correlation and regression analysis on the information extracted from the Annual Reports, the study provides evidence about the extent to which UK banks have complied with recent corporate governance reforms post Enron. The results indicate that improvements in corporate governance can enhance the performance of UK banks when measuring using Return on Equity. The biggest sub-sector driver of this improvement is in the area of the Board of Directors. Our results further indicate that large boards within UK banks can have a negative impact on firm performance, and that increases in directors' remuneration does not lead to increased levels of firm performance. Evidence is given that corporate governance within UK banks plays an important role, but how it affects firm performance is open to debate.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model in Asia. The paper finds that all of the investigated Asian economies issued new corporate governance codes to promote best practices in the Anglo-Saxon model after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. In our sample, the majority of listed firms in Asia implement a separate CEO/chairperson position and appoint a significant number of non-executive directors on the board. The result of this study also indicates that the prediction of the agency theory is valid under the Asian context. Using the combined sample of all Asian economies, we find that ownership concentration has a positive relation on firm performance and the controlling shareholder's ownership has a decreasing positive link with firm value. In addition, firms with a board dominated by non-executive directors are associated with higher performance, and smaller boards are linked with better performance. The paper also finds that the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model is more effective in Asian countries adopting the continental law system and without the influence of Confucian values.

Purpose of article - Board of Directors are characterized as essential elements in the structure of corporate governance. Hence, this study aimed at identifying the governance practices of Latin-American companies in relation to the fifth principle - "Responsibilities of the Board" - recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for this region (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile). Design/methodology/approach - To that end, the legislation and corporate practices of companies in the four countries were studied so as to identify legal provisions on the subject and additional procedures adopted by such companies comparatively to OECD recommendations. Findings - The results showed that Mexico was the country with the highest level of full compliance with OECD recommendations, followed by Argentina, Brazil, and lastly by Chile. They also showed that a lot of improvement still needs to be made so as to ensure the responsibilities of the board in terms of integrity, efficacy remuneration dissemination, and technical competence. Research limitations/implications - This study was restricted to only four countries in Latin America: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile. This procedure is justifiable by the fact that OECD designed its recommendations based on these four countries. It is also important to point out that this study has focused only on Principle V of OECD (2004), concerning the Responsibilities of the Board of Directors. Originality/Value of article - This study is justified by the need to understand and disseminate Latin-American practices in face of the region-specific governance recommendations designed by OECD, notably on the behavior of the Board of Directors. This region has developing countries with an active stock market. The region presents great potential for economic development, hence the need for these types of studies.

Corporate governance has often been defined in a narrow way as comprising 'the range of control mechanisms that protect and enhance the interests of shareholders of business enterprises' (Fama and Jensen 1983). In the corporate governance literature there has also been a general focus on the structure and functioning of boards of directors and the responsibilities of audit committees in relation to external auditing (Rosenstein and Wyatt 1990; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). This article looks at the evolution of the role of external auditing in corporate governance. The role of the external auditor has changed through time, and consequently it should not be assumed that the role of external auditing is fixed or that it cannot be changed to meet societal needs and expectations. This observation leads to the primary argument of our article, which is that the role of the external auditor in corporate governance ought to be expanded in order to enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance for the benefit of a wider spectrum of stakeholders and society generally.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

This study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend pay-outs, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. These policies directly depend on the interactions between managers, shareholders and debt holders. Using a UK cross-sectional sample (374 firms for the year 2000), the results suggest that the bundles of financial and governance policies differ between levels of overall intangible asset intensity, levels of all intangible assets other than research and development (RD), categories of intangible assets (RD versus non-RD) and levels of stock of RD. Hence, the level and type of intangible assets seem to have significant impact on financial and governance policies. Different levels and/or types of intangible assets seem to require different portfolios of financial and governance policies.

Based on 1125 firms of Split-share Structure Reform on June 30, 2008, the relationship between corporate governance and consideration ratio is examined with ordinary multiple regression methods from micro aspects of corporate government structure. Empirical results show that the company's ownership structure and the consideration have a significantly linear relationship. When a listed company's ultimate controller is state-owned, the floating shareholders get higher consideration. When the firm's ultimate controller is non-state-owned, the tradable shareholders receive less consideration. In addition, the greater the Z index (the deviation between the first and the second shareholders), the higher the consideration. The ratio of shares of top ten shareholders and the consideration have a positive relationship but not significantly. EPS and consideration have a negative correlation. Different commitment variables have different impact on consideration. Whether the corporation issues B or H shares, the size of board of directors and independent directors do not express an obvious correlation. (c)2009 IEEE.

Following the publication of the Spanish Code of Corporate Good Governance in 1998 (known as the Olivencia Code), some companies voluntarily created audit committees in line with the recommendation that all firms, and especially listed companies, should do so. The aim of this work is to analyse the factors associated with voluntary audit committee formation in companies listed on the Spanish Capital Market through 1999. In particular we analyse factors such as board independence and size, the board chairman/CEO duality, auditor size, agency costs, ownership, economies of scale, institutional investors, the audit report and auditor tenure. We find that voluntary audit committee formation is positively correlated with the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors and economies of scale, while the evidence reveals a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between board size and voluntary audit committee formation. We also formed another sample excluding financial institutions, for which we found that audit committee formation is positively associated with board independence and economies of scale, and negatively associated with the audit report and audit tenure.

According to past empirical studies, the board of director has the function of increasing firm value. However, in Taiwan, where family control is the rule, the board does not play an effective monitoring role. We suggest that in this type of environment, CEO's honesty is the foundation of effective corporate governance. In this study, we develop a proxy variable to represent the CEO's Management Philosophy (MP) by calculating the ratio of executive compensation divided by the net income of the firm. Then, we use the variation in this ratio to evaluate the CEO's MP. If the ratio is less than zero, it means that the CEO is not only benefiting the stakeholder, but also him/herself. In contrast, if the ratio is more than zero, it means that CEO is primarily benefiting him/herself from taking advantage of the stakeholder. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between MP and firm performance. We find that a decrease in MP will increase firm value. In addition, to evaluate conflict of interest [1], we also measure the impact of having bankers on the board of directors on firm value. The results show that the presence of bankers on boards does not improve the board's firm monitoring. Our results confirm that bankers on boards does however, offer protection to creditor faced with the dilemma of being both stockholder and creditor. (c)2009 IEEE.

The dual-board corporate governance mechanism adopted by publicly listed companies in China combines the board of directors found in the American system and the supervisory board in the German system. Using agency theory, this study investigates the effects of the characteristics of the supervisory board, and in particular its monitoring functions, on the financial risk-taking decisions made by corporate boards. We find that the frequency with which a supervisory board meets can be divided into monitoring-driven and non-monitoring-driven components, and that its monitoring effects on financial risk-taking behaviors are non-linear.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how executive stock options help in reducing agency costs in the firm and to address problems experienced by the firm when stock options are used as incentives. Design/methodology/approach - The paper initially discusses types of agency problems caused by company managers and then explains why stock options can reduce the problem of excessive risk aversion displayed by some managers. It then addresses the problems that may occur with the introduction of executive stock options by the firm and finally offers methods to reduce these problems. Findings - The paper explains the methods available to reduce the problems caused by executive stock options such as indexing the stock options to the S&P 500 index and structuring the Board of Directors in a manner that helps ensure the stock options are used appropriately. Originality/value - This paper is valuable to firms using executive stock options as incentives to managers. It outlines the problems stock options can help solve and the problems which may occur by their use. In addition, the ways to reduce the problems produced by executive stock options in the firm are discussed. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan has advocated the importance of corporate governance for several years. The purpose of this study is to act in concern with the policy through the test of the relationship between the corporate governance mechanism, especially Board of Directors' composition and ownership structure, and the involuntary delisted firms. The study extracts 58 involuntary delisted firms from Taiwan Securities Exchange (TSE) during 1997 to 2007 and matches with 112 similar control firms. The results from probit regression suggest that Board of Directors (BOD) with more number of outside independent directors, larger board size, lower ratio of shares pledged to the total shares, higher seats over control right, and lower control right over right for cash flow may reduce the likelihood of delisting. The study could become monitoring indices for internal examination system, the warning signals for investors, and the reference for the policy makers.

Tunisia is one of the countries where the banking sector forms the core of the financial system. However, despite the weight of bank intermediation for financing Tunisian economy, assets of banks relative to GDP are very low. In addition, Tunisian banks have a high credit risk associated with low levels of profitability, liquidity and capitalization. The presence of these signs of fragility in the Tunisian banking system motivated us to study the determinants of this low profitability of banks. The contribution of this study is that it examines the impact of organizational variables, in addition to macroeconomic and financial variables, focusing primarily on the role played by the Board of Directors. The interest to this internal governance mechanism stems from the particularities of banks corporate governance. The empirical results of this study, contrary to expectations, show that the board of directors, despite its great importance, it granted only a limited place in Tunisian banks and it has several shortcomings in relation to its mission.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

The presence of women on boards of directors has become a high profile issue in recent years. Several studies, based largely on data from countries with Anglo-Saxon corporate governance systems, have investigated the influence of female board appointments on firm performance. This study focuses on the impact of female directors in Spain, where debate about this topic has been intense for two reasons: the recommendation in 2006 by Spain's Unified Good Governance Code of positive discrimination in favour of female board appointments and the passing in 2007 of a Gender Equality Act by the Spanish parliament. Our paper analyses the short and long term effect of the appointment of female directors prior to these events. We use an event study to analyze the short term stock market reaction to the appointment of female directors and a multiple regression approach, using the system GMM estimation procedure, to assess the long term influence on firm value of female boardroom appointments. We find that the stock market reacts positively in the short term to the announcement of female board appointments, suggesting that investors on average believe that female directors add value. This belief appears to be confirmed by our regression results which show that female board appointments are positively associated with firm value over a sustained period. These results suggest that the legislative changes in Spain make economic sense as well as advancing the cause of women in Spanish boardrooms. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

This article reviews recent research into corporate voting and elections. Regulatory reforms have given shareholders more voting power in the election of directors and in executive compensation issues. Shareholders use voting as a channel of communication with boards of directors, and protest voting can lead to significant changes in corporate governance and strategy. Some investors have embraced innovative empty voting strategies for decoupling voting rights from cash flow rights, enabling them to mount aggressive programs of shareholder activism. Market-based methods have been used by researchers to establish the value of voting rights and show how this value can vary in different settings. Copyright (c) 2010 by Annual Reviews.

Purpose: This paper seeks to address the effect that principle-based corporate governance practices have on the financial performance of large publicly-listed companies. In 2004, the New Zealand Securities Commission (NZSC) promulgated nine high level principles and guidelines for all business entities with an aim of improving corporate governance practices and boosting investor confidence in the New Zealand capital market. This event provides a point for empirically testing companies' responses. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data for the NZX top 50 companies over the period 1999-2007 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) regression techniques to evaluate whether: those firms that were continuously compliant with the NZSC requirements perform better; and the firm performance post-NZSC recommendations is better than pre-NZSC recommendations. Tobin's Q, market-to-book (MB) and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables.. Findings: The findings indicate that large listed companies have universally adopted the Securities Commission recommendations, establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, and having a majority of non-executive/independent directors on the board which, on average, have seven members. There is support for the view that the NZSC recommendations have had positive influence on firm performance measured by Tobin's Q, MB and ROA. The results show that the presence of a remuneration committee has had a positive influence on firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study provides empirical support for the corporate governance recommendations made by the NZSC in 2004, giving support to the principle-based corporate governance practices to be adopted in New Zealand. The sequential testing of each NZSC recommendation provides a comprehensive picture of performance outcomes which has not been achieved in prior research. The interdependency issues are of interest and the correlation between recommendations provides useful insights. Originality/value: This study offers insights for policy makers interested in adopting principle-based corporate governance practices within their country. Within New Zealand, public policy developments and stock exchange listing requirements/regulatory issues with associated compliance burdens are better informed as a consequence of the research.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the effects of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance on the nature of financial restatements in Malaysia and whether corporate governance characteristics are associated with financial restatements. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this paper are obtained from annual reports that had been restated for the period of 2002-2005 with firm-years being the unit of observation. A control group comprising non-restating firms is formed using match-pair procedures where restated and non-restated firms are matched by size, industry, exchange board classification, and financial year end. The data are subsequently analyzed using a t-test, the Pearson correlation and logistic regression. Findings: The results show that the primary reason for misstating the accounts is to inflate earnings. The nomination committee of the firms that restated is found to be less independent with higher managerial ownership. The logistic regression analysis indicates that the extent of ownership by outside blockholders deters firms from misstating accounts. Surprisingly, audit committee independence is associated with the likelihood of financial misstatement. Financial restatements, nevertheless, are not found to be associated with board independence, managerial ownership, and CEO duality. Finally, the results show that firms with high level of debts are more likely to commit in financial misstatement. Practical implications: The research is significant as it provides evidence on the role of corporate governance, especially the independence of the nomination committee and extent of ownership by outside blockholders in Malaysia. It shows that outside blockholders is effective in disciplining managers so that the accounts so prepared are not misleading. The move in 2007 by the Malaysian Government to require companies audit committee to be composed of only independent and non-executive directors, as well as requiring audit committee members to be financially literate, should be seen as important in ensuring the effectiveness of the audit committee. Originality/value: This research is considered as the first study which examines the effects of corporate governance variables on the incidents of financial restatements in a developing country. The findings of this paper would be useful for policy makers in evaluating the importance of corporate governance in emerging countries, specifically on the issue of quality financial reporting.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We propose that high levels of monitoring are not always in the best interests of minority shareholders. In family-owned companies the optimal level of board monitoring required by minority shareholders is expected to be lower than that of other companies. This is because the relative benefits and costs of monitoring are different in family-owned companies. Research Findings/Insights: At moderate levels of board monitoring, we find concave relationships between board monitoring variables and firm performance for family-owned companies but not for other companies. The optimal level of board monitoring for our sample of Asian family-owned companies equates to board independence of 38 per cent, separation of the chairman and CEO positions, and establishment of audit and remuneration committees. Additional testing shows that the optimal level of board monitoring is sensitive to the magnitude of the agency conflict between the family group and minority shareholders and the presence of substitute monitoring. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the effect of additional monitoring on agency costs and firm performance differs across firms with different ownership structures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For policymakers, the results show that more monitoring is not always in the best interests of minority shareholders. Therefore, it may be inappropriate for regulators to advise all companies to follow the same set of corporate governance guidelines. However, our results also indicate that the board governance practices of family-owned companies are still well below the identified optimal levels. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the influence of corporate board structure on corporate value. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected on a sample of 245 Thai non-financial listed companies to examine the effect of board structure on firm performance. Findings: The results show that neither independent directors nor grey directors are the significant determinants of improving firm value. Research limitations/implications: This research was confined to 245 Thai non-financial listed companies. It would be useful to replicate it using larger samples under different country settings. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance to top managers in deciding the Board structure as corporate value is also grounded in corporate board structure. Originality/value: The paper provides far reaching implications for corporate managers about the relationship between Board characteristics and corporate value. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The specific monitoring effect of boards of directors versus industry regulation is unclear. In this paper, we examine how the interaction between bank-level monitoring and regulatory regimes influences the announcement period returns of acquiring banks in the US and twelve European economies. Research Findings/Insights: We study three board monitoring mechanisms - independence, CEO-chair duality, and diversity - and analyze their effectiveness in preventing underperforming merger strategies under bank regulators of varying strictness. Only under strict banking regulation regimes, do board independence and diversity improve acquisition performance. In less strict regulatory environments, corporate governance is virtually irrelevant in improving the performance outcomes of merger activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate a complementary role between monitoring by boards and bank regulation. This study is the first to report evidence consistent with complementarity by investigating the effectiveness (rather than the prevalence) of governance arrangements across regulatory regimes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our work offers insights to policymakers charged with improving the quality of decision-making at financial institutions. Attempts to improve the ability of bank boards to critically assess managerial initiatives are most likely to be successful if internal governance is accompanied by strict industry regulation.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual. Research Question/Issue: This article explores the rising tension between shareholder and director power in the common law world. First, the article analyzes key arguments in the shareholder empowerment debate, and current US reform proposals to grant shareholders stronger rights, from a comparative corporate law perspective, examining how traditional US legal rules diverge from other common law jurisdictions. Secondly, the article discusses power shifts in the opposite direction - namely toward the board - in some parts of the common law world. It considers the potential friction between legal rules designed to enhance shareholder power and commercial practices designed to subvert it. Research Findings/Insights: The article shows that US shareholders have traditionally had unusually restricted rights compared to their counterparts in common law jurisdictions, such as the UK and Australia. The article challenges a number of arguments supporting this traditional US approach, by showing that the arguments are often US-specific, and are less persuasive from a comparative corporate governance perspective. The article also identifies an important tension between legal rules designed to enhance shareholder power and commercial practices designed to subvert it. It shows how the dynamic nature of regulation, and the strategic response of regulated parties, can affect the operation of legal rules. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The article broadens the scope of the US shareholder empowerment debate, by means of a comparative law analysis. It challenges an evolutionary/managerialist theory of US corporate governance, by showing that other jurisdictions have made different choices concerning the allocation of power between shareholders and the board. The article also shows the importance in comparative corporate governance scholarship of focusing not only on the terms of specific laws, but also on the commercial responses of parties subject to those laws. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The article assesses the role of shareholder participation as a regulatory mechanism to enhance corporate governance legitimacy. The global financial crisis has highlighted some of the dangers of untramelled managerial power and under-regulation. The article provides important regulatory insights to policy makers, concerning the appropriate balance of power between shareholders and the board of directors. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Purpose: The primary aim of this paper is to examine whether boards of directors with independent members function as effective corporate governance mechanisms in Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), by analysing four characteristics of non-executive directors (NEDs) that impact on their effectiveness, namely their degree of independence, information, incentive, and competence. Design/methodology/approach: Being exploratory in nature, the research uses qualitative methods for data collection. It is based on an interpretivist perspective of social sciences, analysing and explaining the factors that influence the effectiveness of NEDs. Findings: The findings indicate that the NED system is weak in China as a result of the concentrated ownership structure, unique business culture, intervention of controlling shareholders and the lack of understanding of the benefits brought by NEDs. Research limitations/implications: The paper examines the salient features of and challenges to the system of NEDs of SOEs in present-day China. It provides an understanding of how the various perceptions of the board, gathered from in-depth interviews of corporate directors, leads to new interpretations of board effectiveness. The research, however, is limited owing to a relatively small sample size and the sensitive nature of the information collected. Originality/value: The study aims to fill gaps in the literature and contribute to it by assessing the "real" views and perceptions of NEDs in China in an institutional environment significantly different from that of the USA, the UK and other western economies.

The main goal of this paper is to examine the relationship between the three most important characteristics of the board of directors with firm performance. More specifically, we investigate whether the independence of the board, the leadership structure and the board size, are exogenous determinants to the firm's performance, using a simultaneous equations framework. Our database is composed of firms quoted in the ASE, starting from 146 observations in 2000 and ending with 232 firms in 2006. The findings suggest that the board independence and the leadership structure do not affect the firm performance. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between board size and firm performance is observed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a proprietary database for the largest 158 European companies during 1999-2004, I find that transparency of executive pay disclosures and sensitivity of executive pay to performance increase with the proportion of top executives serving as company directors and with dual chief executive officer (CEO) and board chairs. These relations strengthen in countries with more protection for outside shareholders. The positive marginal effects of executive directors (i.e., insiders) on transparency of pay disclosures and sensitivity of pay to performance are not significant when (1) insiders already have the numerical majority on boards, (2) CEOs are board chairs, and (3) pay levels and company ownership of executives are relatively high. Overall, the evidence supports the optimal-contracting argument over the rent-seeking argument. Specifically, companies mitigate agency costs associated with the existence of company executives on boards through transparent pay disclosures and incentive compensation. However, such actions are limited to companies with strong country-level investor protection and significant representation of independent directors on company boards.

Purpose: Corporate governance is an area of interest to researchers, stakeholders and the general public. In recent times, there has been an increased concern about the effectiveness of the board within corporate organizations due to corporate scandals and accounting irregularities of some well known firms, which highlighted the inefficiency of monitoring corporate boards and the overseeing of managerial decision making. This paper aims to investigate the effects that a number of factors such as organisational demography, organisational size, ownership type, board size, CEO duality and CEO dependence/independence have on board configuration. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the literature on organisational demography and board structure characteristics. Primary data were gathered from 27 management shipping companies having their head office in Greece. Findings: Findings show high levels of influence of the CEOs on the Board of Directors, since in most cases the CEO is the Chairman of the Board and high levels of control asked by the top management teams in almost all strategic decision processes. Originality/value: The paper's contribution lies primarily on investigating issues relating to corporate governance in an extremely dynamic, highly extrovert, truly international and at the same time family owned sector; the shipping industry.

This paper reports the association between firms' internal corporate governance mechanisms and their auditor switch decisions in the Chinese context. We identify two types of auditor switch, namely switching to a larger auditor and switching to a smaller auditor. Three variables are used to proxy for firms' internal corporate governance mechanism, including the ownership concentration (shareholding by the largest owner), the effectiveness of supervisory board (SB), and the duality of chairman of board of directors (CBoD) and CEO. We regressed the internal corporate governance variables over firms' audit switching types during a specific period of 2001-2004 when a bear market continued in China. The empirical results demonstrate that firms with larger controlling owners or in which CBoD and CEO are held by the same person are more likely to switch to a smaller auditor rather than to a larger one. However, the effect of the SB variable does not have a significant impact on auditor switching decisions. In general, the study findings suggest that firms with weak internal corporate governance mechanism tend to switch to smaller or more pliable auditors in order to sustain the opaqueness gains derived from weak corporate governance. On the other hand, with the improvement of corporate government, firms should be more likely to choose large (high-quality) auditors in making auditor switching decisions. (c) 2010.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the power dynamics of the boards of directors in family-owned and listed Turkish companies. Power and dominance in the boardroom can be studied in relation to three variables: the institutional environment in which the firm is embedded; the structural configurations of the board; and the top manager's propensity to exercise his/her power resources. Focusing on the board level, this paper aims to conceptualize power dynamics as being composed of structural attributes, roles assumed, responsibilities, dependency and representation. Design/methodology/approach: The research domain of this exploratory study is family-owned and listed companies operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The data for the study were collected from three different sources: a survey administered to members of the boards of directors; discourse analysis of corporate governance compliance reports of the same companies; and in-depth interviews conducted with board members. Findings: This study shows that on a typical board of directors of a family-owned and listed Turkish company, the interests of owners and managers are aligned and other stakeholders are not represented; the role of the board is confined to visibility and legitimacy and does not include control. Originality/value: This paper argues that theories developed for Anglo-Saxon equity-market based business systems have limited exploratory power for an emerging economy - namely Turkey - that is based on a business system characterized by close co-operation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets.

Purpose - The paper aims to study the effect of tenure on the structure of CEO compensation. The relation between CEO compensation and CEO tenure provides a good testing bed for many effects: the managerial power effect, the portfolio consideration effect, the learning effect, and the career concern effect. Design/methodology/approach - Tobit regressions were run of the percentage of equity-based compensation on CEO tenure and the effect of tenure compared between inside CEOs and outside CEOs. Findings - It was found that the percentage of equity-based compensation increases during the early years of tenure for outside CEOs, and decreases during the later years of tenure for inside CEOs. Before they are tenured, outside CEOs have significantly higher and faster growing percentage of equity-based compensation than inside CEOs. Furthermore, the portfolio consideration effect and the learning effect are the major effects in explaining the effect of tenure on the compensation structure. Practical implications - The evidence that boards of directors take into account the CEOs' holdings of equity incentives, the types of CEOs, and their years on tenure to adjust the structure of CEO compensation indicates that firms should, and do, try to optimize their CEO compensation structure on the basis of firm-specific or CEO-specific characteristics. It is suggested that there is no simple formulaic approach to governance reform. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature by studying and explaining the different patterns of compensation structure over CEO tenure between inside CEOs and outside CEOs.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to research studies on boards of directors in the Chinese transition economy that are by far, few and limited. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses basic data compilation method to investigate the board characteristics of large and medium Chinese companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2006. Sample data on these companies were obtained from the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) database that contains information on at least 1,350 listed companies in a particular year. Companies with missing data or incomplete information on board attributes are not included in the sample in this paper. Studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance in the Chinese context are compared to those studies in the West for determining whether there is a conclusive empirical outcome. Findings: This investigation found some significant differences in board characteristics between the Chinese and Western contexts, such as non-compliance with legal requirement, equity-based compensation structure for board members, and lag in the establishment of Chinese board committees as compared to their counterparts in developed Western countries. In addition, the literature review reveals that studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance from the small community of scholars investigating the Chinese context produce inconclusive results similar to those studies of the West. Practical implications: The empirical findings and literature review suggest that the prototype of an effective board may vary from one industry to another, or even from one company to another, and perhaps across time for the same company. Originality/value: This contingency approach to board impact on firm performance may be relevant to companies operating in the Chinese transition economy, where factors are evolving continuously at the micro, macro, and international levels.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of directors and officers liability insurance (D&O) on corporate governance and firm performance. D&O insurance demand reflects the firms internal evaluation of its exposure to litigation risk. From the investors point of view, the D&O insurance purchase data can provide valuable information to assess the underlying risk of the firm, corporate governance quality and its future performance. Thus, this article studies the information implications of D&O insurance on the following questions. (1) Does D&O insurance demand reflect the litigation risk and corporate governance? (2) Does D&O insurance create moral hazard or provide incentives of care to directors and officers, which subsequently affect the firms performance? We empirically test the data by using companies listed in Taiwan Security Exchanges and find that (1) the demand for D&O insurance is positively related to the firms litigation risk and the motivation of its board of directors; (2) there is no evidence supporting that D&O insurance does have a significant impact on the directors care incentives and the subsequent firms performance. We further provide some suggestions for corporate governance based on these empirical results. (c) 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

The board of directors is an important entity in a company, creating a link between shareholders and managers and therefore playing an important role in the governance of a firm. This study focuses on board structure and the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. This study found that the size of the corporate board does have some influence on the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. It is quite surprising to find that the rest of the variables involving the board structure do not have any association with the extent of corporate governance statement.

This paper seeks to examine the association between corporate governance mechanisms and the quality of accounting earnings. We intend to highlight the impact of a strong, religious-based, central government where certain attributes influence corporate governance. Specifically, the study empirically investigates whether the association of corporate governance mechanisms with earnings quality (in particular, accrual quality, earnings persistence, and earnings predictive ability) in Iran is different from what has been established in accounting literature for other countries. Among many corporate governance components, four (4) variables of board size, extent of independent directors, board leadership, and the frequency of the board meetings are considered in this paper. We test our hypothesis using a sample of six hundred (600) firm-year observations of the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2008. The general findings are: a larger board size yields a weaker earnings quality; and an increase in the number of independent directors and frequency of the board meetings, strengthen the firm's earnings quality in terms of earnings persistency and earnings predictability, however, they do not strengthen the accruals earnings. We, however, find no significant relationship between leadership structure and Iranian firms' earnings quality.

This paper analyses how the composition and ownership structure of boards of directors affect firms' R&D investments. Most research on the impact of the board focuses on corporate performance in an Anglo-American context. This study explores the influence of the board on R&D investments in the Spanish corporate governance system, which is different from the British and US systems. Data from 86 Spanish quoted companies in technology industries show that board composition influences R&D investments. Further, our results indicate that ownership structure can moderate the relation between board composition and R&D investments. This study states opposing hypotheses, based on arguments from agency and stewardship theories. We use these theories to analyse the influence of the board on R&D investments as a key factor for success in highly competitive technology industries. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

We examine whether the market assesses a lower level of information asymmetry to firms that are perceived to be monitored more intensely by members of the board of directors. We use changes in bid-ask spreads as proxies for changes in information asymmetry between the firm and the market around the time earnings are announced. Our study is innovative in its association of director monitoring with levels of information asymmetry as reflected in quoted spreads. Our sample includes 145 firms included in the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Index (TSX-300). The TSX's hybrid market structure provides a unique international setting in which to examine the effects of governance on information asymmetry. Results indicate that the market attributes a lower level of information asymmetry to firms with a larger proportion of outside directors on the board. Contrary to our predictions, we find the larger the proportion of voting rights held by directors, the higher the level of information asymmetry attributed to the firm. We provide some evidence that a separate CEO/Chair leadership structure is associated with reduced information asymmetry. From a practice perspective, we are able to provide some preliminary insight into the potential value attributed by market participants to the imposition of regulation surrounding certain director monitoring activities.

We assess the extent to which Chinese MBOs of listed corporations enable a balance to be achieved between facilitating growth and supporting the interests of minority shareholders other than the buyout organization. Using novel, hand-collected data from 19 MBOs of listed corporations in China, a matched sample of 19 non-MBOs and the population of listed corporations, we examine the extent to which boards of directors are changed to bring in executive and outside directors with the skills to grow as well as restructure a business. We also examine the extent to which outside directors become involved in actions to develop the business rather than actions related to fostering the interests of all shareholders. We find in fact little evidence that outside board members have the skills to add value to the MBO firms. Boards appear to focus mainly on related-party transactions with some more limited attention to growth strategies. Outside directors do not seem to openly disagree with incumbent managers on the disclosure of their actions but may express their views and exert pressure behind the scenes.

Recent finance literature suggests that managers of divesting firms may retain cash proceeds from corporate asset sell-offs in order to pursue their own objectives, and, therefore, shareholders' gains due to these deals are linked to a distribution of proceeds to shareholders or to debtholders. We add to this literature by examining the role of various corporate governance mechanisms in the context of the allocation of sell-off proceeds. Specifically, we examine the impact of directors' share-ownership and stock options, board composition and external large shareholdings on (1) shareholders' abnormal returns around asset sell-off announcements, and (2) managers' decision to either retain or distribute (to shareholders or to debtholders) sell-off proceeds. We find that non-executive directors' and CEO's share-ownership and stock options are related to shareholders' gains from sell-offs for firms that retain proceeds. However, corporate governance mechanisms are not significantly related to shareholders' gains for firms that distribute sell-off proceeds. Furthermore, we find that the likelihood of a distribution of proceeds, relative to the retention decision, is increasing in large institutional shareholdings, executive and non-executive directors' share-ownership and non-executive representation in the board.

We test whether Thai listed firms with higher levels of good governance policy adoption are less likely to violate listing rules and laws designed to protect shareholders. Our results suggest that firms on average implement, substantively as opposed to symbolically, recommended governance policies, as violations occur less frequently among firms with higher governance policy adoption scores. However, we also find evidence of symbolic governance among a small group of 'talk-only' firms that issue statements about governance while lagging in the adoption of policies related to shareholder rights and the board of directors.

This article examined the effects of board structure of American media companies on their performance from a stakeholder perspective. Results showed that both the level of board interlocks and the proportion of non-independent directors on the board were positively associated with corporate performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity. Results also showed that the adoption of staggered boards had a positive effect on return on assets of media companies. However, this study did not find any relationship between board size and firm performance within media industries. (c) 2010 Journal of Media Business Studies.

The current financial crisis has deep macroeconomic roots, but the dominant view of the firm has made the crisis deeper and more devastating. Over the past few decades, maximizing shareholder value has become the main objective of the firm. Chief executives have been keen on this objective because their economic incentives have been clearly associated with stock market performance. Unfortunately, this has driven many CEOs to make terrible decisions based on short-termism and greed. In this way, the firm has become the object of anger, criticism and cynicism. In Building Respected Companies, Jordi Canals argues that we must address this problem by developing companies that serve society, not just their shareholders. This requires a new perspective of what a firm is, what the purpose of the firm in society should be and what the role of the board of directors and senior executives should be.

This paper deals with one of the most interesting topics related to corporate governance: the role of the banks in the governance of nonfinancial firms and its consequences on the value creation process. We explore the impact of bank participation in shareholding, board of directors, and financing on the governance of nonfinancial listed Spanish firms. We show that governance behavior depends on the bank's position of power within the firm, and that when banks participate in a firm where a nonbank controlling shareholder holds different control and cash flow rights, banks act as an efficient control mechanism. But if the controller is the bank and has the capacity to expropriate, then it becomes a predator. This opportunistic behavior is lessened when the bank's position as shareholder is combined with its interests as a creditor.

In the theoretical framework of corporate governance, this article studies the efficiency of the control exerted by the ownership structure and the board of directors on managers for the purpose of privileging investment in R&D. This efficiency is sensitive to national systems of governance. Tests realized on a sample of 531 U.S., Japanese and French firms with the canonical method corroborate the existence of positive relationships between concentration of ownership, the internal administrator dominance and the non-dual structure on the one hand, and the investment in R&D, on the other.

Corporate secretaries make a considerable contribution to corporate social responsibility (CSR) processes by the nature of the positions and responsibilities they hold in organisations. They act as a servant or full member of the board of directors, the body that formulates corporate strategies; which are subsequently executed by executive directors. When corporate secretaries become full members of the board, they pass on their duties as the secretary to someone else and take on the role of governance in directorship capacity. The field of CSR has impacted on all professions that aspire to make a positive contribution to societies. For this reason, members of the chartered secretaries' professional body and those other chartered bodies in the UK who statutorily can become corporate secretaries have had to absorb all the challenges and opportunities that the field of CSR has thrown at them, albeit in collaboration with their other senior executive colleagues in organisations. This chapter seeks to analyse how corporate secretaries have contributed and continue to contribute to recent developments in the field of CSR. The chapter argues that modern stakeholders look on corporate entities to meet all their economic, social, ethical, legal and philanthropic responsibilities whilst remaining virtuous, Friedman (1962, 1970), Elkington (1997) and Carroll and Buchholtz (2003) even though meeting these responsibilities may at first sight appear contradictory and impossible, de Wit and Meyer (2004). Wood (1991) argues that business and society are interwoven rather than distinct entities. If this is so, then it is relevant to ask how today's professionals including corporate secretaries are coping with the task of meeting their CSR requirements to society. There are numerous benefits that can emanate from following a good corporate citizenship strategy or being involved in several pro bono publico activities by an entity according to Jones et al. (2006), as this action is one of the variables that determine whether an entity survives and prospers or declines and fails in modern markets. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Intangible assets show a set of characteristics-namely, high levels of risk and uncertainty, firm-specificity, human capital intensity, low observability and long-term nature-that make them markedly distinct from other categories of assets. These characteristics are likely to have substantial impact on the levels of agency costs of debt (asset-substitution and under-investment problems) and equity (hidden action and hidden information problems), information asymmetry, bankruptcy costs, transaction costs of debt and equity, and non-debt tax shields. Consequently, this study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend payouts, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. Using two UK cross-sectional samples (373 and 356 firms for the years 2000 and 2001, respectively), the results suggest that the level and type of intangible assets have a negative impact on leverage and no impact on dividend payout, managerial equity ownership, outside equity ownership, board structure and audit demand.

Focusing on the agency theory*the review describes the main agency problems that arise between managers and owners*between managers and debt holders*and between majority and minority shareholders in a family ownership structure. Three decades of family business articles published in the main financial journals are reviewed. This look at the literature on the topic evidences a field of research that is incipient*little explored in Latin America*for which empirical comparison and contrasting is necessary in order to understand the family ownership structure worldwide. The article ends by proposing a family business research agenda including topics such as financial performance*the role of the heirs*debt structure*the composition of the board of directors*the impact of agency costs on capital costs*and private control benefits.

This study sets out to examine three issues: whether financially distressed firms are more likely to manipulate their earnings, whether the board of directors of these firms has a low level of independence, and whether the opinion of their auditors reflects the possibility of financial distress. This study uses a dataset of listed and de-listed firms from 1997 to 2007 to examine various factors and conditions before a firm's financial distress, including the variables of earnings management, corporate governance, and audit opinions. This study is unique in its combination of these three variables to build a financial distress prediction model, which is used to verify whether financial distress has occurred in a firm recently. The prediction model may help countries or firms to predict and prevent the likelihood of a financial distress. (c) Hsiao-Fen Hsiao, Szu-Hsien Lin, Ai-Chi Hsu, 2010.

The role of a company director is, as a member of the Board of Directors, to create value for an organisation through both performance (direction) and conformance (control). Performance relates to setting the mission, values, and strategic direction of the organisation; a socially responsible director considers the impact of these on both stakeholders and the natural environment. Conformance relates firstly to accountability through setting internal policy and procedures, and adherence to both internal and external (such as laws) rules and procedures, and secondly to transparency through reporting to stakeholders; a socially responsible director supports high levels of each. Company directors realise their role through decision-making, and so it is essential to examine the impact of their experience, demographic characteristics, and personal values on their decision-making processes. Directors have access to a wide range of information and resources on CSR and its relationship to corporate governance, including legislation and case law, guidelines, reports, professional associations, corporate constitutions and codes of conduct, and professional and academic literature. An overview of the place of CSR in company directors' decision making is given through reference to empirical research. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In this study we construct, for the first time in Israel, an index for ranking the quality of corporate governance of Israeli firms. The index, based mainly on principles that are common in existing international indices, focuses on four main topics (the abilities of the board of directors, audit and control, ethics and honesty, and transparency), and it includes 19 variables. An empirical analysis of 173 public companies (included in the TASE 100 and YETER 150at the end of 2005) finds the following: 1. Disperse ownership companies and companies with a higher return on equity have better quality corporate governance; 2. There is a significant positive correlation between our index ranking the quality of corporate governance and a firm's relative value (Tobin's Q); The causality of this relation is, however, unknown, i.e., we do not show or argue that better corporate governance increases firm valuation; 3. The existence of an ethical code, few transactions with interested parties, early publication of periodical reports and the inclusion of a small number of directors who are also employees of the corporation, are components of the index that are most strongly correlated with the value of the firm; 4. Dual companies have a higher level of corporate governance and higher Q values.

Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) are governed by two boards: the Board of Directors (BoD) and the Shari'a Supervisory Board (SSB). The SSB is a panel of Shari'a scholars who act independently from other governance organs. This paper discriminates between dependent SSBs and independent SSBs by using twenty one variables, which are classified into three groups: the implementation of governance best practices, the recruitment of SSB members, and the relationship between the SSB members and other governance organs. This study is one of the first studies that provide empirical results about the SSB independence. Nevertheless, the research focuses exclusively on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and excludes the other countries where Shari'a supervision might have different forms. The study has developed a hypothesis, which was tested by a questionnaire. Data was collected from 76 Shari'a Supervisory Boards, 73 Boards of Directors, and 59 shareholders of IFIs in the GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE) during 2009. The discriminant analysis has been used in identifying both dependent and independent SSBs. The paper finds five variables relevant in discriminating the two groups. These variables are the incentives provided to the SSB; the average remuneration to the SSB members; the existence of the policy of penalties for violating the code of conduct; the relation between the SSB members and the BoD; and the role of executive management in recruiting SSB members.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

This paper uses a sample of 76 family businesses in Tunisia to investigate the impact of the family firm dynamic on the composition of their boards of directors. We argue that whether or not a transition in ownership is planned, firms have different governance needs and characteristics depending on the generational phase. The empirical results show that board composition is positively influenced by both generational evolution and succession planning. This study provides evidence of an increase in the appointment of outside directors to boards of family firms from the third generation of ownership. This result implies that it is important to consider the generational phase and succession process of the family firm in order to better understand its governance system.

The present research examines the role of activist institutional investors in the formation of the board of directors. Activist institutional investors, such as pension funds, have a long term investment perspective and are independent of the firms in which they hold significant stakes. This study finds that pension fund ownership is associated with boards that are more independent of management and have more balanced compositions. The strongest results pertain to an overall board quality index reflecting board efficiency, board leadership, board independence and balance. The finding that activist institutional investors influence the board vindicates the efforts of regulators to encourage institutional investors to be active in terms of corporate governance.

Purpose: While international corporate unethical behaviors seem to permeate uncontrollably, it is nevertheless, not an incurable dilemma. The paper aims to address the key steps in achieving such governance: chief ethics officer, tone-at-the-top, and whistle-blower hotlines. With that said, this paper will also address the value of unethical behavior, both from a macro and a micro perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an archival literature review to date on international corporate governance, and its challenges to achieve international corporate ethics compliance governance are analysed. Findings: One of the greatest challenges for international corporations is establishing a setup that involves more than the board of directors and senior management, but every employee within the corporation. A key compliance challenge is creating an international corporate culture that tolerates and encourages employees to come forward and report improper conduct. Originality/value: International corporate unethical behaviors are not myths, should not remain taboo, and should be addressed immediately, for it is not an incurable dilemma. Those who do not learn from one's corporate unethical behaviors are deemed to repeat it. Those who do not learn from others' corporate unethical behaviors are deemed to commit it. Reputation takes time to establish but takes less time to ruin. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This work proposes an explanation to contrast the relationship for different countries between company governance mechanisms and the discretionality of the management, and to determine whether these mechanisms are conditioned by the institutional environment. Based on a sampling of 765 companies from seven countries of the European Union during the period from 2000 to 2003, we find that the discretionality of the management tends to decrease in proportion to concentration of ownership, there is an increase in legal protection for the investors and a decrease in levels of indebtedness and in the size of the board of directors. As a result, in an attempt to analyze the combined effect of the institutional framework and the governance of the company, we find evidence that different governance mechanisms become superfluous when there is strong protection for the investor.

Corporate governance risk is a kind of uncertainty, attributed to the change of external & internal environment and the unexpected events, which could not lead the corporate governance structure and mechanism to perform accountability for stakeholders. The management of corporate governance is a process across the corporate, effected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to identify potential risk that may result to corporate governance defeat, and manage corporate governance risk to be within it appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of corporate governance objectives. This paper puts forward an integrated framework of corporate governance risk management which includes three objectives categories, ten components and three entity levels. (c) 2010 IEEE.

This paper discusses the degree to which codes of corporate governance and the guidelines that develop around them tend to shift the locus of control away from the board of directors. It is argued that even in principles-based codes of governance such outcomes are an unavoidable consequence and that policy makers should weigh such consequences carefully before promulgating codes and guidelines. The case of the treatment of footprints (incentive plan performance averaging periods) by the UK's Association of British Insurers (ABI) is analysed to illustrate the problem.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the educational qualifications and experience of executive and non-executive members of directorial boards in Australia. Inspired by Galbraith's (1967) analysis of the 'technostructure', we examine the educational qualifications of managerial (executive) directors and non-executive directors to assess the extent of divergences in the relevance (to the company's operations) of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications. In addition, we measure the 'relatedness' of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications to determine the extent to which the set of educational qualifications of executive directors diverges from that of non-executive directors. We find significant differences in the relevance of the educational qualifications possessed by executives and non-executives. We also find very low relatedness between the two sets of educational qualifications. The advantages of board diversity on the one hand and the disadvantages that may attend potentially sub-optimal technical information flow on the other are discussed.

The aim of this paper is to explain the particular characteristics of the corporate governance of banks and its role for good bank performance. In order to do that, it reviews the existing literature on this issue trying to answer three main questions: (i) Why are banks different? Existing research points at diverse features, such as, regulation, supervision, capital structure, risk, fiduciary relationships, ownership, and deposit insurance, that would make banks special and thereby influence their corporate governance. (ii) What is different about bank governance? According to past studies, banks' boards of directors are larger, more independent, have a superior number of committees and meet more often, but seem to play a weaker disciplinary role. Executive compensation would be higher in banking, but pay-performance sensitivity appears lower. (iii) What works for banks? Larger boards, more concentrated ownership structures and certain levels of managerial shareholdings are the principal factors suggested by the empirical evidence to date that seem to lead banks to higher performance.

Recent failures/collapse of high profit institutions around the world such as Enron, Parmalat, Worldcom, Barings Bank to mention just a few have shown that no company can be too big to fail. A common trend that ran through these monumental failures was poor corporate governance culture, exemplified in poor management, fraud and insider abuse by both management and board members, poor asset and liability management, poor regulations and supervision among others. This paper examines the conceptual framework of corporate governance. Some of the components of corporate governance in general and in the Nigerian banking sector in particular were identified and observed. Secondary sources were basically consulted for the purpose of this work and simple percentages were also used to explain a few of the findings. The study revealed that the boards of directors of a good number of these banks were ineffective and that the internal controls were equally weak as a result of the overriding influence of the chairman/chief executive officers. It was also observed that there were instances of insider abuses such as granting of insider related credits, huge non-performing loans and so on. In addition, lack of transparency and non-disclosure of financial transactions were very rampant in the banking sector in Nigeria according to the study carried out. Recommendations made include total separation of ownership from management, sound internal control system, full disclosure of all financial transactions and strengthening the enforcement mechanism of the regulatory authorities.

The profession of Chinese certified public accountants (CPA) has the particularity in corporate governance, which is mainly reflected in the following basic elements of corporate governance framework: Shareholders, board of directors, managers, government supervision agencies, professional self-regulatory organization, employees, other stakeholders, markets and information disclosure. The particularity is not recognized in practice, which results in the imperfectness in corporate governance of the profession. The quality of audit reports is affected accordingly. In order to improve the quality of audit reports, this paper makes researches on the special nature of corporate governance framework of CPA profession, extracts the worldwide successful experience in corporate governance, and puts forward some measures to solve these problems.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

This study considers the effect of board of director composition on corporate tax aggressiveness. Our logit regression results for a choice-based sample of 32 corporations comprising 16 tax-aggressive corporations and 16 non-tax-aggressive corporations show that the inclusion of a higher proportion of outside members on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The ordinary least squares regression results from our sensitivity analysis of a cross-section of 401 corporations confirm our main results about board of director composition and tax aggressiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How are national institutional systems related to the proportion of women found on corporate boards of directors of companies listed in particular countries? Which particular types of national institutions play the most important role? We explore cross-country variation in the pattern of female representation on corporate boards and evaluate the extent to which it is associated with the nature of national institutional systems as captured in five frameworks each of which emphasizes the importance of a distinct type of national institutions. Our analysis includes 38 countries and covers the years 2001-07. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that as much as half of the variation in the presence of women on corporate boards across countries is attributable to national institutional systems and that culturally and legally-oriented institutional systems appear to play the most significant role in shaping board diversity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study suggests that country-level institutions, previously neglected in studies of board diversity, play an important role in shaping the prevalence of women on corporate boards and that these need to be more fully incorporated in future research on board diversity. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The importance of national institutional systems for board diversity suggests that policy levers of a regulatory nature and national cultural characteristics are important elements in driving corporate board diversity and offer distinct opportunities for tailoring a mix of corporate governance interventions that suit the particular institutional nature of a given country.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

The aim of this article is to analyse the internal mechanisms of corporate governance (board of directors and ownership structure), which influence voluntary disclosure of intangibles. The results appear to corroborate the view that an increase in institutional investor shareholding has a negative effect on voluntary disclosure, supporting the hypothesis of entrenchment, whereas an excessive ownership by institutional investors may have adverse effects on strategic disclosure decisions. The results also indicate that an increase in the number of members of the board to up to 15 has a beneficial effect on the disclosure of intangibles. However, as this number increases, the effect inverts and becomes adverse to improving the capacity for supervision and control in the decision-making process regarding the voluntary disclosure of intangibles. The findings endorse the recommendation of the most of the Corporate Governance Codes regarding an advisable maximum of 15 members on a board to ensure its effectiveness and internal cohesion.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

This study examines the influence of Mexico's efforts to improve corporate governance on firm performance and transparency. We utilize compliance data from the Code of 'Best' Corporate Practices, disclosed annually by public firms in Mexico, as a measure of corporate governance strength. We document a significant increase in compliance over 2000-2004 indicating Mexican companies view non-compliance as costly. However, we find no association between the governance index and firm performance, nor is there a relation with transparency. Instead, we find firms with greater compliance resort to the more costly mechanism of making dividend payments (higher propensity to pay and greater yield) to reduce agency conflicts. We conclude these associations are the direct result of the institutional features of the Mexican business environment, which is characterized by concentrated ownership of insiders, interlocked boards of directors, a lack of insider trading enforcement, and generally poor protection of minority investors. Our results show that monitoring mechanisms alone are not enough to fundamentally change economic behavior. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

Companies in Victorian Britain operated in a laissez-faire legal environment from the perspective of outside investors, implying that such investors were not protected by the legal system. This article seeks to identify the alternative mechanisms that outside shareholders used to protect themselves by examining the dividend policy and governance of over 800 publicly traded companies at the beginning of the 1880s. We assess the importance of these mechanisms by estimating their impact on Tobin's Q. Our evidence suggests that dividends and well-structured and incentivized boards of directors may have played a role in protecting the interests of outside investors.

Purpose: Effective corporate governance is significant for firms in developing countries because it can lead to managerial excellence and help firms with a weak corporate governance structure to raise capital and attract foreign investors. The purpose of this paper is to examine the barriers, issues, and challenges hindering effective development and implementation of corporate governance in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods was employed to collect information. Specifically, data were collected from 296 managers, company presidents, and board of directors in selected firms. Descriptive data and interview analyses are presented with respect to the barriers and issues hindering effective corporate governance development and implementation in Nigeria. Findings: The study provides significant current information on corporate governance and barriers hindering its development and implementation in Nigeria. The findings reveal a number of constraints that hinder the implementation and promotion of corporate governance in Nigeria. These constraints include weak or non-existent law enforcement mechanisms, abuse of shareholders' rights, lack of commitment on the part of boards of directors, lack of adherence to the regulatory framework, weak enforcement and monitoring systems, and lack of transparency and disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to four cities in Nigeria. A broader geographic sampling would better reflect the national profile. Another limitation could stem from the procedure used in data collection (drop off and pick up). However, extreme measures were taken to protect the identities of the respondents. Originality/value: The significance of this study stems from the fact that very few studies have explored the impact of human resource challenges and prospects in Nigeria. The results provide additional insights into corporate governance practices in Nigeria, a sub-Saharan African country. This region has thus far been neglected by management researchers, and so the insights gained from this study will contribute to the future development of this line of research, particularly in a non-Western country like Nigeria.

Purpose - The purpose of this article is to study the impact of the related parties' transactions (RPTs) on firm value, and to identify the ownership and governance characteristics of companies that engage in this type of transactions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses 3SLS simultaneous model carried out on a sample of 85 companies listed on the Paris Stock Exchange during the period 2002-2005. Findings - The results show that RPTs are mainly influenced by the voting rights held by the main shareholder, the size of the board of directors, the degree of independence enjoyed by the audit committee and the board of directors, the choice of external auditor, the debt ratio and the fact of being listed in the USA. Mainly the transactions carried out directly with the main shareholders, directors and/or managers that have a negative influence on firm value. Research limitations/implications - In future studies, it will be interesting to test the impact of the level of expertise as well as the level of qualification in the field of accounting and finance of the members of the French audit committees on the frequency of RPTs. Originality/value - The current research complements prior studies on the RPT by showing that the frequency of RPTs can be damaging to companies and can destroy their market value.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study first measures tax enforcement efforts for 35 tax regions within China, then analyzes the role of tax enforcement as a corporate governance mechanism by examining whether regional tax enforcement efforts reduce two types of agency costs in Chinese listed firms.Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a pooled sample of 917 listed firms with total 3,668 observations from 2003 to 2006 in China, we find the following results: (1) regional tax enforcement efforts reduce corporate agency costs between shareholders and managers and agency costs between blockholders and minority shareholders; (2) by reducing two kinds of agency costs, tax enforcement efforts improve a firm's market performance; and (3) the governance role of tax enforcement efforts is more significant for state-controlled firms than for entrepreneur-controlled firms.Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that tax enforcement can act as a corporate governance mechanism. Tax authorities not only have the ability to increase national tax revenue, but also play a positive role in decreasing agency costs, including agency costs between shareholders and managers and those between block shareholders and minority shareholders.Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers a new insight to policy makers interested in transforming economies that corporate governance build-up should be multidimensional. Besides the traditionally internal governance mechanisms represented by boards of directors and external governance mechanisms represented by takeover markets, tax enforcement is also an important corporate governance mechanism. The enforcement power of tax authorities could be better utilized to supervise firm operations in emerging markets. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

How should companies be organised? To whom should boards of directors be responsible - shareholders, or a wider group of stakeholders? In this fiercely competitive world we cannot judge our own system of corporate governance in isolation; it must bear comparison with the best. The second edition of this book aims to do just that. Since publication of the first edition interest in corporate governance has greatly increased, codes have proliferated, and principles laid down nationally and internationally. The author describes developments in the system of corporate governance - both the business environment and the particular structures of company organisation - in five major industrial countries: Germany, Japan, France, the USA, and the UK. This second edition is fully revised, updated and expanded, and includes a new conclusion looking at a number of ongoing issues in corporate governance, and an appendix discussing the role of international organisations.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether board independence and ownership have any influence on the decision on CSR disclosure. This study uses the proportion of pages in an annual report and a CSR disclosure checklist to measure the extent and quality of a firm's CSR disclosure. Multiple regression and logistic regression analysis are employed to test the hypotheses. The paper finds that boards of family owned firms are negatively associated with the level and the quality of CSR disclosure. The fact that board independence is not significant on CSR disclosure could be due to the fact that CSR initiatives are strategic in nature. Finally, firm's size, performance and leverage are found to have significant effects on CSR. This study was conducted among Malaysian top 100. The generalizability of the findings of this study is, thus, limited to Malaysian large firms. One of the major findings of this study is the ineffectiveness of the board of directors in ensuring firms discharge its social responsibility. Relevant authorities may need to come up with measures to ensure independent directors are effective. The study adds to the understanding of how ownership structure plays an influential role as oppose to independent board of directors on CSR disclosure in Malaysia.

Using firm-level corporate governance data for 385 IPO (initial public offering) firms that sought to be listed on Bursa Malaysia from 1999 to 2008, this study examines the relationship between board structures and IPO underpricing, a performance indicator unique to the IPO context. The study finds that there has been recently a reasonably high level of underpricing in the Malaysian IPO market. Contrary to the prediction of this study, the results indicate that dual leadership structure and board reputation (i.e., multiple board memberships) are positively and significantly associated with the extent of IPO underpricing. It appears that the separation of board chair and CEO positions signals low quality for the IPO firm. Because of the risky nature of IPO firms, investors tend to favour continuity in leadership. Directors who hold outside board memberships with other firms also have a negative effect on investors' assessments of firm quality. Potential investors feel that directors with numerous board seats are inclined to become distracted in which case monitoring intensity is likely to suffer. Other board variables, namely, board independence (i.e., board composition) and board size, do not significantly link to underpricing. Finally, the study finds that both firm size and the total number of risks factors disclosed are negatively and significantly related to underpricing. Overall, these results provide evidence supporting that good corporate governance practices are likely to help potential investors identify quality IPO firms.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We study the relation between mutual fund performance and Morningstar's fiduciary grades using quantile regression models. This research is important because we shed new light on the principal-agent issue in the mutual fund industry, and investors and professional managers often use Morningstar's rating system to guide their investment decisions. Quantile regressions allow us to examine the differential impact of mutual fund governance variables such as manager incentives and board quality on fund performance across the entire performance distribution. Research Findings/Insights: Quantile regressions find a strong contemporaneous association between Stewardship Grade and Sharpe Ratio. Manager incentives, though not significant in the OLS regression, are positively related to the fund performance for better performing funds, and negatively correlated with portfolio turnover. However, manager incentives are shown to have little predictive power for funds' future performance. In contrast, board quality, which is in the center stage of the proposed SEC mutual fund regulation, bears little relationship with contemporaneous fund performance, yet is strongly related to funds' future performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our analyses and results have two important implications for the principal-agent theory. Our finding that board quality has a more profound impact on fund performance than manager incentives suggests that incentive alignment through compensation contracts is less effective in mitigating agency problems than quality board monitoring. Our quantile regression results also provide new insights to the analysis of corporate governance research. The major advantage of using quantile regression is that it reveals the whole spectrum of heterogeneous mutual fund performance responses to their governance efforts, especially the behavior of funds at the tails of the distribution; hence better corporate governance policies can be drawn up and instituted. This methodology is useful for other governance research as well and entails meaningful regulatory implications when firms/industries are heterogeneous and the conditional means of traditional regression analysis does not provide much information and guidance for corporate decision making. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study shows that fund performance is associated with manager incentives contemporaneously, while board quality predicts fund performance in the long haul. This finding has important regulatory implications, as the efficacy of SEC's proposal on board and chairman independence is under great debate. Our results also provide useful information for investors who use Morningstar's Stewardship grades to guide their investments. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Purpose: This study aims to test empirically the relationship between board equity ownership and corporate governance on earnings quality of for-profit corporations, to help practitioners enhance corporate governance practices. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines two competing theories of equity ownership (convergence of interests and management entrenchment) to explain how board members react to owning the firm's stock and whether governance impacts their behavior. In a sample of 499 publicly traded firms, a governance index was calculated and the relative power of equity ownership and governance was regressed on reported earnings quality. Findings: The results support the management entrenchment theory. Both independent and insider board members become entrenched, negatively impacting reported earnings quality and the strength of the governance structure. However, effective governance using a composite of mechanisms moderates the effects of entrenchment. Research limitations/implications: The effect of individual governance variables on earnings quality is not identified. The reader should not generalize the results of this research to other types of organizations, such as not-for-profit or governmental entities. The authors studied for-profit, publicly held firms where directors act as agents of the stockholders and corporate governance is tasked with the responsibility to monitor management and improve investor confidence in reported earnings quality. The authors acknowledge that in other types of entities, the governance culture and objectives may be different and the results of this study may not apply. Practical implications: The results provide insight regarding the motivations and behavior of board members and the impact of stock ownership on their actions. Stronger governance controls are needed within the entrenchment range of stock ownership. Firms should not rely on oversight by independent board members to control insider board members. A composite of governance mechanisms can moderate negative behavior. Originality/value: The results challenge commonly held beliefs that independent board members and board members who own stock will perform their fiduciary duty. This means that governance mechanisms should address all board members, not just specific types and that equity ownership must be very high before it can be relied upon as effective.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the governance role of private equity (PE) firms in post-LBO companies in the US. We propose and test whether PE firms remove entrenched CEOs or CEOs who cause agency problems. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 126 PE sponsored LBOs in the USA between 1990 and 2006, we document a CEO turnover rate of 51 per cent within two years of an LBO announcement. We find that the boards of directors replace CEOs in companies with high agency costs, as measured by low leverage and a high level of undistributed free cash flow. In addition, unlike the boards of directors in public companies, the boards in post-LBO companies tend to replace entrenched CEOs. Finally, the boards are more likely to replace CEOs if pre-LBO return on assets is low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: According to the agency theory, a PE-sponsored LBO is a new organizational form that reduces agency costs by enhancing corporate governance. This study uses CEO turnover as a setting to test that prediction. We find that PE firms replace CEOs who can cause agency problems, thus providing empirical support for the proposition that PE firms improve corporate governance in LBO companies. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in regulating PE firms. Our results suggest that, in the US, PE firms provide effective corporate governance mechanisms by replacing incompetent and entrenched CEOs. In addition, our results provide a set of factors for PE firms to consider when they make CEO retention decisions. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of bank governance presented by the (Board of Directors size, CEO duality, percentage of non-executive directors, capital adequacy, the ownership percentage of large shareholders, and the ownership percentage of the largest shareholder) on the banking performance as measured by Tobin's Q. This study was conducted in Jordanian commercial banks (N=13) during the period from 2002-2009. To test the hypotheses, we used the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) based on the multiple regression technique. Results showed that council Executive Office Duality CEOD, percentage of nonexecutive directors NEDRATIO had statistically significant positive effect on Tobin's Q; whereas Leverage Value LV had statistically significant negative effect on Tobin's Q, the remaining variables (Capital Adequacy, size of Board of Directors, and the largest shareholder, Blockholders equity ratio) had no statistically significant effect on Tobin's Q. The conclusion from this study is that governance variables as represented by CEO duality, percentage of non-executive directors, ownership concentration, and capital adequacy are recognized as effective determinant on banking performance, so that corporations are advised to take governance as vital not as duty before authorities. Further more, private and public sectors need to work cooperatively to establish governance mechanisms ensuring best banking performance, especially the increment of the proportion of non executive directors on board of directors and the compliance with the requirements of Basel II.

Purpose: This paper attempts to investigate the relationships between the board of directors' characteristics and earnings management being a proxy of earnings quality in two separate countries, France and Canada. Specifically, it aims to investigate how certain contextual features affect differently earnings management behavior, and to reveal which factors are the most prominent incentives of management discretion in both cases. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a performance matched discretionary accruals (PMDA) measure as a proxy for earnings management. Three separate panel-regressions are then performed on a full sample, comprising a French sub-sample and a Canadian sub-sample, to detect board characteristics and institutional features' impacts on the PMDA. Regressions are based on a panel of 180 French and Canadian listed firms' data over the period 2006-2008. Findings: Evidence shows that CEO stock ownership, independent monitoring and institutional investor's property are strong earnings management determinants in both the French and Canadian frameworks. Nevertheless, leadership structure and board size seem to be neutral. Furthermore, French firms show specific earnings management incentives which are related to high ownership concentration, low equity widespread and high contractual debt costs. Dominant minority ownership and capital market forces are the key earnings management incentives in the Canadian context. These findings are robust to alternative sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: Even though the findings answer some questions, earnings management incentives are still to be decided. Future research could further highlight the impact of contractual, legal, cultural, ethical and political country-specific factors related to financial reporting. Originality/value: This paper investigates how an effective board of directors is able to provide a monitoring mechanism to ensure high quality of earnings. Moreover, it builds on cross-country variations in corporate governance features and contextual-specific factors to reveal earnings management behavior's incentives in two separate environments, namely French and Canadian ones. The underlying promise is that poor corporate governance (weak board monitoring), high ownership concentration, and intensive financial market forces create incentives that largely influence manager's willingness to report earnings that don't reflect a firm's true performance.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board of directors' independence and executive compensation disclosures transparency. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines compensation disclosure practices of a sample of 181 firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Board independence from management is assessed through an aggregate score which takes into account the proportion of independent directors, board leadership structure (i.e. CEO is the board chairperson), and the existence and independence of board committees. A cross-sectional regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between board independence and the extent of compensation disclosure. Findings - The paper finds that board independence from management is positively related to the transparency of executive compensation-related information. In addition, this study documents a positive (negative) relation between firm size, US cross-listing, growth opportunities (leverage) and the extent of executive compensation disclosure. Research limitations/implications - The study's results provide support to the managerial opportunism hypothesis in executive compensation. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors as an effective governance mechanism which limits managerial rent-seeking in the design as well as the disclosure of executive compensation practices. Originality/value - This paper extends prior disclosure studies by examining the impact of board characteristics on the transparency of executive compensation disclosures in a principles-based governance regime. Furthermore, executive compensation disclosure provides an interesting setting in which to examine the ability of the directors to act independently from managers in a conflict of interests situation.

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether the qualitative dimension of the ownership structure, in particular the family identity of the controlling shareholder, infl uences the optimal configuration of the Board of Directors, as well as the effect that such configuration has on firm value creation. The econometric technique used, the system estimator of the Generalized Method of Moments, applied to a panel of Spanish family and non-family listed companies in the period 2001-2007, allows us to solve the traditional problem of endogeneity existing in studies of corporate governance. The results show how the need for advising and monitoring depends on the family nature of the controlling shareholder and, therefore, the optimal structure of the Board of Directors differs between the two classes of companies under consideration. Among the main conclusions, we found that, contrary to the widespread believe, smaller and more independent boards are not always more efficient.

This study analyzes the influence of ownership structure and the board of directors on top management team (TMT) pay levels in a sample of Spanish listed firms. When panel data methodology is applied, the results show that TMT pay level is affected by the supervisory effectiveness of the board. This, in turn, is influenced by ownership concentration and the type of major shareholders. When ownership is dispersed, the board is more effective in their supervision and TMT pay level is lower. However, when ownership is concentrated, the quality of supervision and, consequently, TMT pay levels depend upon the type of shareholder that is predominant.

Stemming from different theoretical perspectives the article examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, local governments, private shareholders, service providers) that at various levels are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on 10 Italian listed local public utilities are summarized. Different and coexisting situations of conflicts of interest among multiple principals and agents are identified. In this context, governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts. However, our findings suggest that the ownership structure influences board composition and functioning and that higher numbers of independent directors do not necessarily mean "actual" board independence. The article contributes to the debate on conflicts of interest and governance mechanisms in local public utilities. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

This paper examines the relation between acquirer (abnormal) returns and governance characteristics of the board of directors of the acquiring firm. The central question is: Are higher (acquirer) abnormal returns associated with 'better' board governance, having controlled for other factors that can affect returns? As acquisitions represent a significant change in the acquirer's corporate structure and operations, the determinants of a successful acquisition are of considerable importance. We examine the relation between returns and governance variables using a sample of 80 Australian acquisitions that occurred between 1999 and 2005. We use both short-run and long-run (abnormal) returns to capture the wealth effects of the acquisitions. We find very limited evidence of a connection between our governance variables and acquirer returns.JEL Classification:G14, G34. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

This is a comparative study of Enron and Satyam corporate frauds. An attempt has been made to arrive at some generalizations about the key reasons for the differences between agency and tunneling problems. Agency effect and tunneling phenomena focus on the divergence in the interests of managers, promoters, and minority shareholders, which are the key reasons for corporate fraud. There is a clear difference between the fraud committed due to tunneling and agency effect. The article highlights this feature through the case study of Enron and Satyam. The difference between tunneling and agency effect has important implications for corporate finance. Corporate finance is based on the assumptions of separation of ownership and management and also perpectual continuity of corporation. If these two assumptions are dropped, then many of the widely accepted theories may not hold. The article concludes that the legal framework, nature of financial system, and level of economic development are the key factors which determine the level of agency effect and tunneling problem. Solutions to corporate governance problems are quite different in India as compared to the US or Europe. Hence, it would be inappropriate to copy American legislations like Sarbanes Oxley Act in India. Effective prevention of destructive self-dealing activities is necessary for development of vibrant capital market, whereby small investors will be confident to invest in the Indian market, since they will perceive risk premium to be low. The key policy prescriptions are as follows: * Effective delivery of justice is as important as enacting investor-friendly laws. * Creation of subsidiary companies by the parent company and large financial transactions with banks should be viewed with suspicion. On the part of the shareholders, they should be suspicious of any self-dealing transactions. Since the time of Harshad Mehta, when stock brokers, promoters of the company, and bankers connived to cheat small investors, enforcement agencies view even large banking transactions with suspicion. * Small investors and institutional investors should play a proactive role to seek information and reject any decisions which reduce their value of shares. Proactive participation of outside shareholders in the corporate affairs of the company, especially in the selection of board of directors and approval of resolutions, are the key remedies to prevent such cases. * There should be an effective control of black money. * Certain clues like promoters setting up too many subsidiaries, frequent changes and resignations in board of directors, consistent decrease in promoter stake or increasing liquidation of equity options, are clear signs of fraud taking place. Regulatory authorities should work on such clues and operate in such a way that there is least chance of regulatory arbitrage. (c) 2011 SAGE Publications.

This study empirically exams whether the internal corporate governance mechanisms of the firms represented in Latin American equity markets lead to the expropriation of minority shareholders' rights; and whether such expropriation leads to economic underperformance. The data is a sample of 97 companies from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, for a 3-year period (2000-2002). The results suggest a relationship between the characteristics of a firm's board of directors and the expropriation of minority shareholders' rights. Finally, the study provides evidence that expropriation of minority shareholders' rights may lead to under performance in emerging economies. (c) 2009 Springer-Verlag.

As a part of its banking reform, China is standardizing the practice of boards of directors and giving a full play to their decision-making and board oversight function. This paper helps to predict the effect of such effort by examining the relation between board governance structure and performance of Chinese banks for the period of 1998-2007. The authors find that Western governance mechanisms within the principal-agent framework work effectively in Chinese banks. Boards with stronger governance structure produce superior financial performance in Chinese banks. Specifically, higher board ownership, lower percentage of insiders on board, and lower block ownership are associated with better bank performance. These findings suggest that strengthening board governance and introducing global best practices and accountability will likely improve Chinese bank performance significantly and it is the right direction to take as China's banking reform deepens.

Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment portfolios and savings funds that are controlled and actively managed by a sovereign government. In this paper, we document the investment behaviour of a specific fund, Temasek Holdings, which is the Singapore government's SWF. Using a sample dataset of 150 publicly listed Singapore firms over the period 2000-2004, we find evidence suggesting that Temasek has a predisposition to invest in firms that are relatively large and have few director block holders. The incentive to invest also increases in firms with lower systematic risk and with compensation schemes that provide the board of directors with stocks and options. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the association between corporate governance attributes in the form of board and ownership characteristics and the remediation of internal control material weaknesses (ICMW) reported under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. The paper employs multivariate logistic regression models for a sample of 528 firms having ICMW as per their auditors' attestation reports during the fiscal periods of 2004, 2005 and 2006 to investigate the empirical relationships between board and ownership characteristics, and remediation of control weaknesses in subsequent fiscal years. The board diligence, CEO-independent board, and managerial, institutional and dominant shareholdings are all positively and significantly associated with the ICMW remediation of the sample firms in the presence of other firm-specific variables in the analysis. The results also suggest that, in general, the ownership characteristics play a greater role in the firms' remediation action than the board-related factors except board diligence. The separate sub-sample tests demonstrate that board diligence and several stock ownership characteristics are positively and significantly associated with a firm's action to remediate both the systematic and non-systematic internal control weaknesses though the results are more robust for non-systematic control weaknesses. A useful extension is to conduct a detailed analysis of the effect of audit committee characteristics in conjunction with board and ownership characteristics on firms' remediation action in a setting where ICMW firms take such action at a differential pace that may continue over two or more fiscal periods. Further, the present study examines the empirical associations between variables of interest, and does not, by virtue of its results, establish any cause-and-effect relationship between governance attributes and timeliness in ICMW remediation. Finally, this research can be extended to a detailed analysis of the types of systematic and non-systematic control weaknesses, their probable effect on firms' financial reporting process and the role of corporate governance in timeliness of management's remediation action for different types of internal control problems. The paper adds to the existing literature on corporate governance and financial reporting quality by documenting the association between a firm's board and ownership characteristics and management's immediate action to remediate internal control problems that ultimately impacts the quality of reported accounting information. The study complements prior studies on ICMW remediation and accrual quality by demonstrating that the effective monitoring by board and large, sophisticated shareholders as well as greater alignment of manager-shareholder interests ensures more timeliness in remediation of internal control weaknesses and improves financial reporting quality.

Purpose: The main aim of this paper is to examine the role of the board of directors in Russia with specific attention to their independence, employee relations and ability of successful adaptation of the international standards. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a survey questionnaire to provide an empirical example from a transition economy to the corporate governance literature by exploring the attitudes of the 55 board directors from 30 listed companies on the Russian Trading System (RTS) Stock Exchange. Findings: The respondents recognise the board of directors as an important instrument of efficient and good corporate governance practice. More surprisingly, they are also in favour of employee representatives on the board of directors and agree that board size and composition should be enhanced by employee representatives on the board. Research limitation/implications: Even though 200 questionnaires were distributed and the response rate was 28 per cent, the authors know that they cannot generalise results for all directors of 1,414 listed companies on the Russian Trading System Stock Exchange from this level of response. In addition, questions might have some elements of subjectivity. Practical implications: Policy makers in Russia should continue reforms in Russian corporate governance to improve transparency and accountability to adopt international standards and to attract foreign capital. Originality/value: This study is one of the most comprehensive studies to explain the role of directors of listed companies in corporate governance throughout a survey questionnaire in Russia. The authors believe that the study contributes to the literature in two ways: theoretically by examining the attitudes of Russian listed company directors in the literature and empirically by conducting a survey among listed companies' directors to evaluate the attitudes of boards of directors, and employee relations in Russia.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use voting result of shareholder proposals as an indicator of the level of conflicts between board and minority shareholders. OLS regression and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests have been applied in the analysis. Findings - It was found that cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Also, the tension between board and minority shareholders is affected by both corporate governance factors and a company's stock performance. Research limitations/implications - In general, the research result indicates that cumulative voting is still an effective mechanism that can lower investors' costs on monitoring boards of directors. Practical implications - Considering the huge amount of resources used in shareholder campaigns, the research result indicates that cumulative voting can be an efficient choice to alleviate the confrontation between dissenting shareholders and board of directors. Social implications - With the change of minority shareholder structure, it is necessary to examine whether the corporate world needs to reconsider the adoption of cumulative voting. Originality/value - The authors use a novel proxy, voting results of investor proposals, to measure the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. This is also one of the few papers focusing on the monitoring cost side of the agency cost problem in corporate governance literature. (c) 2011, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The separation between control and ownership in the modern firm creates information asymmetry between managers and shareholders. The superior knowledge about the firm's operations stimulates managers to manage financial information. We investigate which managers characteristics are more likely to positively influence earnings management practices. Specifically, we study whether the CEO's age, education, expected tenure and duality of roles affects earnings management for a sample of listed Portuguese firms for the fiscal years 2005 to 2009. Results indicate that older CEOs, CEOs with management or finance background, and CEOs that also hold the position of Chairman of the board of directors are more prone to manage earnings.

This paper examines the sensitivity of the governance mechanisms to the financial information quality in an emerging context which is the Tunisian market. It focuses mainly on the characteristics of the board of directors and the ownership structure in order to determine the principal governance mechanisms in the Tunisian firms. Using a multivariate analysis of variance for a sample of 22 firms listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange, we find that the accounting quality affects the implementation of the governance mechanisms in the Tunisian firms. Particularly, the irrelevance of the financial reporting increases the control by the foreigners, the families and the blockholders and reduces the presence of the State and the financial institutions in the Tunisian firms. Our findings confirm the governance role of the accounting information in the Tunisian market(c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the board structure and process disclosure (henceforth BSPD) level on corporate performance, depending on the Anglophone vs Francophone business culture prevailing in African emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: The BSPD score is measured by searching 220 annual reports (year ended 2006) for information of 35 items provided by S&P's template in 11 emerging markets in Africa. The empirical model builds on multiple regressions and assumes interaction between the Anglophone/Francophone business culture and BSPD level to affect corporate performance. Findings: African companies from countries having historical links with Great Britain exhibit substantially higher BSPD scores than those from countries having historical links with France. The influence of BSPD level on corporate performance is more pronounced for financial Anglophone African companies than non-financial Anglophone African companies. Practical implications: Providing BSPD levels for African emerging markets helps to a better understanding of the board of directors' activity and characteristics that prevail in both Anglophone and Francophone African companies. The implications are potentially useful for regulators, market authorities and standard setters in order to provide new requirements on corporate governance narrative reporting in African emerging markets. BSPD scores obtained for African emerging markets can also serve for comparison with other emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to examine the effect of BSPD level on corporate performance in African emerging markers. This study contributes to asserting the role of Anglophone vs Francophone business culture in shaping the level of disclosure on board structure and activity and its influence on corporate performance in Africa.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of founder families in medium-sized manufacturing firms and to investigate the impact of such influence on risk management - more specifically foreign exchange hedging and speculation. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study uses survey data and publicly available data for descriptive analysis and ordinary least squares/ordered regression analysis. Findings: The authors find that two thirds of medium-sized manufacturing firms are founder family firms in which the founder of the firm or members of his/her family are active in the management team, are members of the board of directors, and/or are shareholders of the firm. The study finds no difference between such founder family firms and other firms in terms of the use/non-use decision related to foreign exchange derivatives but a marked difference in terms of the extent decision. Thus, founder family firms tend not only to hedge but also to speculate more extensively than other firms. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on medium-sized manufacturing firms in Denmark. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the influence of founder families in medium-sized firms and adds to the sparse literature on the impact of founder family influence on risk management.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

This paper empirically investigates the mechanism through which product market competition (PMC) affects disclosure quality of listed companies. Based on a sample of listed companies with disclosure quality report from Shenzhen Stock Exchange during 2003-2008, PMC is found to display a U-shaped relationship with disclosure quality, which demonstrates the strategic effect of PMC on disclosure quality. PMC is also found to enhance the board of directors' role in disclosure quality, which demonstrates the governance effect of PMC on disclosure quality. These results enhance the understanding of the role of PMC on disclosure. (c) 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Wealth creation insights by the creator of the company life-cycle framework known as the CFROI valuation model. Investors searching for companies whose future profitability will far exceed that implied in current stock prices, those in business making decisions to improve company performance, and politicians crafting legislation-all use some form of a wealth creation framework. In this book, author Bartley Madden addresses how to think about the complex dynamics in generating wealth and the practical benefits to be gained from upgrading one's wealth creation framework. Throughout these pages, Madden shares six critical insights: A systems mindset focuses not so much on the individual pieces of a system, but on how all the pieces work together to achieve the goal envisioned for the system. The systems way of thinking described in Wealth Creation helps to avoid unintended, bad consequences, and to generate insights for leveraging change that produces big gains in wealth Economic systems -- the rules and relationships that exist to create wealth by delivering value to customers -- are devilishly complex and therefore solving economic problems requires extensive knowledge. Seen in this light, knowledge growth and wealth creation are two sides of the same coin. A prerequisite to making better buy/hold/sell investment decisions and business judgments is an improved understanding of how wealth is created. An especially useful approach described in this book is to connect business firms' financial performance to stock prices via the firms' competitive life-cycle framework A deeper understanding of business firms makes it plain that customers,employees, and shareholders havemutual, long-term interests. In other words, a free-market system geared to serving customers through competition is a system in which participants share the wealth that is jointly created There is a huge opportunity for sustained, higher economic growth through voluntary initiatives by the private sector. One initiative involves an accelerated implementation of lean management, which was pioneered by Toyota. This is a systems approach that continually purges waste and optimizes the use of resources in delivering value to customers The other initiative concerns improved corporate governance. The wealth creation principles discussed in this book offer a blueprint for boards of directors to vastly improve how they fulfill their responsibility to shareholders, and in so doing, improve the performance of corporate America These ideas have taken shape as a natural outgrowth of a commercial research program that began in 1969 at Callard, Madden & Associates focused on how to value business firms. It produced the CFROI (cash-flow-return-on-investment) metric and its related life-cycle valuation model. This work was further advanced at HOLT Value Associates, which was later acquired by Credit Suisse in 2002. Credit Suisse HOLT continues the research to improve the valuation tools and related global database that analyzes 20,000 companies in over 60 countries. This system is used by a large number of institutional money management firms worldwide in order to make better investment decisions. (c) 2010 Bartley J. Madden. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on the structure of the board of directors that is considered more suitable in terms of corporate social responsibility, and also on those contextual factors that could influence the socially responsible behavior of family firms. Empirical analysis on 535 non-listed Spanish firms leads to the identification of three clusters in terms of the variables related to boards' structure: family dominated boards, professional boards and immature boards. Results show that the firms that have boards' structure with more potential for a socially responsible behavior (professional boards) are the ones who are bigger, older and with higher generational evolution.

In the recent years the Russian Government has undertaken serious steps to improve corporate governance practices by introducing the Corporate Code of Governance (CCG) and strengthening the role of corporate boards to monitor top management performance. This paper investigates whether these measures have stimulated positive changes by increasing the demand for higher quality audit. We test our hypotheses using 147 non-listed companies to examine whether board composition influences audit fee in the Russian capital market. Our findings support the demand-side perspective of audit services and suggest that audit fees are associated positively with the presence of an independent chairman, higher proportion of independent directors and State representatives on the board.

In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, many industrialized States have increased their stakes in corporations (State-owned enterprises) worldwide. Therefore, the idea of governments as value-creating institution is increasing and questions concerning innovation are even more pressing. Indeed, there has been a great deal of both scholarly and professional interest in innovation believing that it is essential to public sector effectiveness. Theoretical insights from the innovation literature, agency and resource-based theories are done seeking to add knowledge on the relationships between governance mechanisms and State-owned enterprises' innovation. The analysis is on a sample of 88 Norwegian State-owned enterprises mainly operating in the service sector. The results show that some characteristics of the board of directors (e.g., composition, board working-style and board members' knowledge and competences) significantly influence innovation types. Implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed. (c) 2011, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Based on the structure of ultimate controllers, this paper studied the influence of ultimate control right on companies, taking capital structure as object. In the companies with ultimate controllers, ultimate controllers would control companies through establishing pyramid ownership structure and cross-shareholding system. Using 639 sample listed companies in shanghai stock exchange in 2007, this paper established the indicator of deviation degree between cash flow right and ultimate control right, found the ultimate controllers' situation in listed companies, verified the relationship between ultimate control right and capital structure choice. The study showed that the existence of ultimate controller was due to incomplete contract, and companies' residual control right could be controlled further by ultimate controllers through board of directors. From the empirical data of China's listed companies, it did exist ultimate controllers in China and they controlled companies through the pyramid ownership structure. From the capital structure choice of ultimate controllers, ultimate controllers main considered no dilution of equity in liability and the structure of board of directors also impacted the capital structure choice.

In our analyses of 10,390 companies from 51 countries, we find that in countries that have small capital markets free cash flow is positively related to board size. However, this positive relation becomes significantly weak for companies in large securities markets. This result suggests that managers in underdeveloped capital markets have an incentive to construct less effective boards to extract private benefits. However, the distorted managerial incentive is alleviated in developed countries that have various disciplinary mechanisms to ensure good governance practices. We do not find clear evidence that legal protection of shareholder rights mitigates the managerial incentive to construct less effective boards.

A sizable volume of corporate governance literature documents that an independent and competent board of directors matter for organizational success. In order to function effectively, board comprises of different sub-committees and the three most common sub-committees are audit committees, compensation committees and nomination committees. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of research in understanding the determinants of nomination committee notwithstanding the importance of an independent nomination committee in board selection process. We contribute to the nomination committee literature by investigating the factors associated with the determination of nomination committees in New Zealand. We find that cross-sectional variation in the firm-specific characteristics affect the existence of nomination committees. This finding casts doubt on the 'one-size-fits all' approach of corporate governance. Our logistic regression of the nomination committee determinants indicates that firm size, governance regulation and busy directors are positively associated with the existence of nomination committees, whereas firm leverage, controlling shareholders, and director independence are negatively related to the formation of nomination committees.

In an environment with poor quality of Corporate Governance Mechanisms, the quality of directors' attributes might exert an important role to improve firm's value and performance. I developed an index to explore the quality of Board of Directors based on Brazilian and international corporate governance codes to measure directors qualitative attributes. The sample consist in 24 Brazilian firms that traded at NYSE in the period over 1999-2006. The results show us that board of directors with high types of attributes can improve value measured individually and by the quality index. The main results indicate that firm value improved with high types of professionals, accountants seated in boards, directors with high level of education and that participated in executive training.

In view of the high ownership concentration of Chinese listed companies, large shareholders tend to make use of the high voting rights at general meetings of shareholders to control the general assembly, so that they can control the composition and structure of the board of directors. Therefore, it's inevitable to consider the phenomenon of the existence of large shareholders when studying the board structure of China's listed companies. Basing on the large shareholders' "tunneling" behavior, this paper constructs Mechanism model of the influence on board structure from single blockholder; the study portrays the board structural feature of China's listed company that is under the control of single block-holder. After the model inferential reasoning, the conclusion is that: under the assumptions that there exist large shareholders in companies, if the large shareholders can influence the structure of the board members, for the purpose to invade the company's value, the large shareholders will arrange the board members appointed by themselves as many as possible, and reduce the non-appointed board members by themselves as many as possible. Meanwhile, the stronger the control ability of the company's large shareholders is, the clearer this trend will be. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

In Spanish listed firms, taking into account the predominant modes of ownership structure, which are characterized by a high concentration of shares in the hands of a few shareholders who are strongly represented on the board of directors, it might suppose that there are strong stimulus for a close top managers' supervision and a straight interest alignment. However, the empirical evidence indicates the opposite, and this paradox needs to be explained within the theoretical framework of institutional theory. The high concentration of ownership and the high level of cross-holdings generate conflicting interests by those who have multiple roles as directors and top managers, suggesting that board's supervisory effectiveness may be compromised by social pressures in search of legitimacy. These features of Spanish firms are undermining governance mechanisms, and may explain the high pay levels, the low variable packages and, in general, the lack of connection between top managers' compensation and firm performance in comparison with those in other countries of Continental Europe.

The study seeks to understand how the firm's ownership structure and the board of directors' composition influence the structural capital. The latter is apprehended by three main levers: TMT compensation, innovation, and firm's reputation. By mobilizing several panel linear regressions on 274 American firms, the results show that the firms which heavily invest in structural capital are more successful and chaired by the younger and heterogeneous TMT. No disciplinary effect of the board on structural capital has been found. The results support the cognitive theory assumptions. The classic perspective failed to explain the structural capital phenomena. In order to enhance their structural capital, firms must pay a close attention to their board cognitive contribution and not to its disciplinary role.

This study scrutinises the association between ownership identity and board size in a unique institutional setting: state-owned enterprises in Indonesia, a country incorporating a two-tier management structure. It investigates whether the ownership identity explains the size of the board of commissioners by using the year 2006 data set from 155 SOEs in Indonesia consisting of 112 of fully SOEs and 43 of partially- privatised SOEs. This study hypothesizes that SOEs with a higher level of private sector ownership will have a greater incentive to monitor the performance of executive management through board of commissioners than those SOEs that are fully owned by the state government. It finds that compared to those fully SOEs, the partially-privatised SOEs are likely to have more board of commissioners. Even though this result is not statistically significant and, therefore, the proposed hypothesis is not statistically supported, the regression statistical analysis reveals that control variables assist in explaining the size of board of commissioners. The size of the board of directors as a control variable is significantly associated with the size of the board of commissioners. Other control variables including size of the SOE as well as the return on equity measure moderately explain the size of the board of commissioners. The findings give insight to stakeholders such as regulators or the private sector investors interested in making investment decisions in Indonesia considering the ownership structure and the effect on the effectiveness of the board of commissioners.

The article examines the 'political' principles in the running of a limited company focusing, in particular, on the political aspects of the decision-making process. As the board of directors acts as a controlling interface between the shareholders and the directors, we will study the main aspects of corporate governance in relation to the board of directors of a limited company. Finally, we will present the different systems of corporate governance and we will end with the distinctive characteristics of each of these systems.

The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between strong governance structure and the information content of discretionary accruals in countries, which present differences in their legal system (USA and France). To approach the concept of corporate governance which recovers several dimensions: the board of directors, its committees, and ownership structure we used the method of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The findings indicate that the association between stock return and discretionary accruals is greater for firms having a good corporate governance structure independently of the context of study. Further, discretionary accruals of firms having good corporate governance have a greater association with future profitability future only for American context.

Corporate governance is generally seen as a critical determinant of corporation's growth and development, most especially for low income countries. Corporate governance laws have evolved in developed economies often in response to corporate failures or systemic crises. The recent focus on corporate governance has accentuated due to corporate failure in different parts of the world. Most countries developed corporate governance codes that address their institutional specifics. However, corporate laws in Nigeria draw extensive inspiration from British laws maybe, because of the colonial legacy. This study documents extensive evidence to show that existing laws in the country are grossly inadequate to promote good corporate governance. The author advocates for total overhaul of company laws in Nigeria. Such policy prescription must recognize the peculiar challenges of the Nigerian corporate environment, and also establish proactive mechanism for enforcement and compliance.

The failure of the CEO has been studied at great length in the literature. We order and classify the factors that lead to CEO failure into those a CEO can influence (endogenous) and those that are given (exogenous). The absence of unanimity in the literature leads us to conclude that insufficient attention has been paid to the main factor: the personal characteristics of CEOs. The agency approach and method are insufficient to understand leadership performance in organizations, due to the oversimplified view of human nature on which they are based and their heavy reliance on mathematical modeling.

The recent financial crisis highlighted the issue of Board of Directors compensation, which had been analyzed by many authors. In fact, there is a vast academic literature on the impact of the compensation of Board of Directors on corporations characterized by the separation of ownership from control. The compensation of Board of Directors has been a subject of debate, also by global regulators like OECD, FSB, Central Bank of Italy and European Commission and many are pushing for an international uniform regulation. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the board of Directors compensation, the company performance and the risks decided by the Board. The article analyses a sample of Italian listed companies in order to test wether or not the Board of Directors compensation structure could turn into a performance incentive, given the risk taken.

Pension funds are one of the largest institutional investors in the UK. Given the importance afforded to the board of directors and the attention bestowed on the governance role of institutional shareholding, it is important to understand the potential influence of pension fund ownership on board structure. Specifically, is pension fund ownership positively related to a board composition that provides better monitoring of management? The current study examines a sample of publicly traded companies listed on the London Stock Exchange between 1996 and 2005. It is found that consistent pension fund ownership increases are concurrent with and anticipate the improvement of board independence in the medium to long term. In contrast, deterioration in board independence or improvement of board independence to a much lesser extent follows consistent decreases in pension fund ownership. However, improvement/deterioration in board independence does not anticipate pension fund investment/disinvestment. The findings of this research suggest that pension funds play a positive role in improving the corporate governance of firms in which they have significant and long-term shareholdings, but they do not necessarily buy into companies that have good corporate governance in place.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

This paper investigates the role of board structure and the effect of ownership structures on firm performance in New Zealand's listed firms. Several studies, the majority from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, have examined the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and firm performance. Those studies yielded different results, affected by the nature of the prevailing governance system for each country. Investigating New Zealand's listed firms could enhance the diversity of the growing body of work that examines this relationship. Though the majority of studies only tested a linear relationship between variables, a number of studies have found a non-linear relationship between board structures, ownership structures and firm performance, and this study confirms the non-linear relationship. Using a balanced panel of 79 New Zealand listed firms, this study employs a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for robustness. The result reveals that board of directors, board committees, and managerial ownership have a positive and significant impact on firm performance. Meanwhile, nonexecutive directors, female directors on the board and blockholder ownership lower New Zealand firm performance.

A central issue in corporate governance research is the extent to which "good" governance practices are universal (one size mostly fits all) or instead depend on country and firm characteristics. We report evidence that supports the second view. We first conduct a case study of Brazil, in which we survey Brazilian firms' governance practices at year-end 2004, construct a corporate governance index, and show that the index, as well as subindices for ownership structure, board procedure, and minority shareholder rights, predicts higher lagged Tobin's q. In contrast to other studies, greater board independence predicts lower Tobin's q. Firm characteristics also matter: governance predicts market value for nonmanufacturing (but not manufacturing) firms, small (but not large) firms, and high-growth (but not low-growth) firms. We then extend prior studies of India, Korea, and Russia, and compare those countries to Brazil, to assess which aspects of governance matter in which countries, and for which types of firms. Our "multi-country" results suggest that country characteristics strongly influence both which aspects of governance predict firm market value, and at which firms that association is found. They support a flexible approach to governance, with ample room for firm choice. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V..

This article analyses the effects of board composition on the behavior of a sample of 114 Italian local public utilities, for which information about 1630 directors during 1994-2004 has been collected. This period is particularly interesting because of the legal changes that forced many firms to alter their juridical form and accommodated the entrance of private investors. We investigate whether board size and/or board composition do affect decisions about employment and how they ultimately impact performance. Our main findings indicate that politically connected directors, who dominate boards of directors in Italian public utilities, exert a positive and significant effect on employment, and have a negative impact on performance.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We investigate the effects of bank control over borrower firms whether by representation on boards of directors or by the holding of shares through bank asset management divisions. Using a large sample of syndicated loans, we find that banks are more likely to act as lead arrangers in loans when they exert some control over the borrower firm. Bankfirm governance links are associated with higher loan spreads during the 2003-2006 credit boom but lower spreads during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Additionally, these links mitigate credit rationing effects during the crisis. The results are robust to several methods to correct for the endogeneity of the bankfirm governance link. Our evidence, consistent with intertemporal smoothing of loan rates, suggests that there are costs and benefits from banks' involvement in firm governance. (c) The Author 2012.

This study examines the impact of corporate boards on firm performance during the current financial crisis. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the crisis to measure firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we redefine independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call strong independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. We find that the positive impact of outside financial experts on firm performance is more significant than that of strong independence. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

We examine relations between board size, managerial incentives and enterprise performance in nonprofit organizations. We posit that a nonprofit's demand for directors increases in the number of programs it pursues, resulting in a positive association between program diversity and board size. Consequently, we predict that board size is inversely related to managerial pay-performance incentives and positively with overall organization performance. We find empirical evidence consistent with our hypotheses. The number of programs is positively related to board size. Board size is associated negatively with managerial incentives, positively with program spending and fundraising performance, and negatively with commercial revenue, in levels and changes.

In this article, we provide an empirical analysis to investigate whether politicians serving on the board of directors for banks influence performance, lending, and risk taking behaviours. We refer our analysis to all politicians (almost 160,000) belonging to a political body in Italy. Overall, our dataset contains 1,808 board members referring to 123 cooperative banks. Our results suggest that politicians who hold executive roles on the board of directors seem to exert a negative impact on banking activity. Therefore, in the current debate on the reform of the statutes of the Italian cooperative banks, we argue that the problem is not having politicians on the board of directors for banks, but rather allowing politicians to hold executive positions.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of corporate governance attributes of listed Egyptian companies on the propensity (adoption) and comprehensiveness (quality) of corporate internet reporting (CIR) practices. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses archival data from the largest (top) 100 listed companies on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX 100). Corporate governance attributes are captured by ownership structure (free float, managerial ownership, government ownership) and board of directors' structure (board size, board independence, CEO-chair duality). Empirical models are used to estimate the effects of these attributes on the propensity, content, presentation, and overall comprehensiveness of CIR. Findings - The results of this study indicate mixed effects of governance attributes on the choice to adopt CIR and its quality. The results from the Binary Logistic Regression suggest that Egyptian companies with greater (less) ownership dispersion, managerial ownership, governmental ownership, and (board independence) are more likely to adopt CIR. On the other hand - and as revealed by the seemingly unrelated regressions - among CIR companies those with greater (less) ownership dispersion, board size (governmental ownership), and (board independence) have more comprehensive CIR. Originality/value - This study extends the relatively limited research on the effects of corporate governance and CIR in emerging markets. The study contributes to this literature by demonstrating how corporate governance attributes affects the choice to adopt CIR disclosure practices and the level of its quality in an emerging market such as Egypt.

This article investigates the simultaneous participation of directors in 320 Brazilian-listed companies in 2001, 2003, and 2005. Our results show that interlocking directorates are a common practice in Brazil. Firm value is, on average, negatively impacted by interlocking directorships, especially in firms in which a majority of directors hold three or more board positions. We also find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between interlocking and return on assets, consistent with the hypothesis that low and moderate levels of this practice may be beneficial to a company, while a high degree of interconnectedness among directors is likely to hurt performance.

Using data from Hong Kong, a market that has family-concentrated ownership structure, we examine the relation between managerial ownership, the board of directors and firm performance. We first conduct analysis on the managerial ownership and firm performance to derive the turning points where either 'convergence of interest' or 'entrenchment' effect of managerial ownership is dominant. Based on these estimated turning points, we find that at low and high level of ownership, effective board mitigates the entrenchment effect associated with managerial ownership; at medium level of ownership, board effectiveness is less demanded. These findings suggest that managerial ownership and board monitoring are substitutes in mitigating the agency problem between managers and shareholders. We also find that effective board curbs the excessive compensation by entrenched managers to themselves at low level of managerial ownership. (c) 2011 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the impact of busy directors on bank risk. Busy directors are directors with multiple directorships and other corporate responsibilities. Design/methodology/approach - First, univariate analysis is performed to see whether there are differences in governance structures of banks with busy boards and those with less-busy boards of directors. Second, multivariate regression analysis is used with two measures of bank risk as the dependent variable to see whether busy directors impact bank risk, while controlling for other factors that may influence risk. Findings - The paper finds that there are significant differences between banks in terms of governance structure when analyzing banks with busy boards and banks with less-busy boards. Importantly, the study shows that bank risk is positively related to multiple board appointments of bank directors. Research limitations/implications - These results provide support for the "busyness hypothesis" as opposed to the "reputation hypothesis" and add to the understanding of whether busy directors hurt or help boards. Practical implications - Results are important for regulators who seek to maintain a safe and sound banking system. Regulators can gain a better understanding of how much time and effort individual directors can contribute to a bank under examination. Originality/value - This is the first study in the banking literature on multiple board appointments. It also uses a unique approach to test whether director busyness is a determinant of bank risk.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of audit committee meeting frequency in Chinese listed companies.Design/methodology/approach-A multiple linear regression model, derived from the logarithmic model proposed by Raghunandan and Rama, is used to examine the determinants and an unbalanced panel data fixed effects model was used for robust tests.Findings-Based on 912 year-firm observations, the authors found that audit committee meeting frequency was negatively associated with the proportion of shares owned by a majority shareholder and the number of audit committee meetings is less in stated-owned firms than privately-owned firms. Both audit committee and firm size were found to be positively associated with the frequency and there was a negative relationship between the proportion of independent directors on a board of directors and the number of audit committee meetings in China. However, no evidence was found of the associations of the frequency with the proportion of directors who are accounting experts on the audit committee, the CEO-Chairman duality, management ownership, board size, BIG4 and profitability.Originality/value-This is the first paper to present empirical evidence on the determinants of audit committee meeting frequency in Chinese listed companies. The paper looks into the impact of firm ownership on the meeting frequency in China and finds that the number of audit committee meetings is less in stated-owned listed firms than privately-owned listed firms.

Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the level of bad debt provisions of financial institutions is affected by internal governance mechanisms (IGMs) from the perspective of the Type II principal-principal (PP) conflicts between the controlling shareholders and the minority shareholders. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' sample covers all listed financial institutions in China, comprising a panel data set of 139 firm-year observations covering 1999 to 2009. Within China's two-tier corporate governance context, the three IGMs - ownership structure, board of directors and supervisory board - are measured to examine the level of bad debt provisions. Findings: The findings suggest that state ownership and legal person ownership are negatively related to the level of bad debt provisions, but board size reveals a positive association. Other factors including foreign ownership, independent directors, board meeting, supervisory board size and supervisory board meeting were found to have no impact. Practical implications: The spirit of corporate governance reform has not been transferred to financial institutions sufficiently. The board of directors and supervisory board actually act the roles of "window dressing" or "rubber stamp" within the current two-tier system. From the Type II PP perspective, the controlling shareholders are found to moderate the conflicts between other parties but they still expropriate the interests of minority shareholders and are the real beneficiaries of recent reforms. Thus, further financial reforms seem necessary in China. Originality/value: The paper provides an empirical analysis of factors that underlie IGMs during an important period of regulatory change and organizational reform, and fills a literature gap concerning the effectiveness and efficiency of financial institutions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gender composition of the board of directors of Malaysian initial public offering (IPO) companies. This study also examines the business case for having women on boards. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 228 IPO companies that went public during the period 1999-2006, this study tracks the changes in the gender composition of these companies prior to the IPO year, IPO year and three-year post-IPOs. This study also tracks the changes in the gender composition between the pre-IPO period and some 5 to 12 years later after the IPOs for a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) in 2011. The compounded buy-and-hold returns method is used to measure the post-IPO company performance. Findings: This study finds that female representation as board of directors in 228 Malaysian companies prior to the IPO is only about 8 percent. This percentage is almost similar for the subsequent four years (IPO year and three-year post-IPOs). By using a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies in 2011, the percentage of female directors increases only 2.5 percent from the pre-IPO year. However, the increment is not statistically significant. An extended analysis on the business case for women on boards reveals that greater percentage of female representation leads to lower long run underperformance. This underperformance is much lower for companies having more foreign ethnic female representation. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study suggest that there is still a long way to realize the benefits of having female directors in Malaysian companies. Malaysia needs to create an environment that realizes the benefits of having women in the top management levels. Originality/value: This research contributes to the existing literature on gender especially in the context of IPO companies. This is the first comprehensive study on gender composition using Malaysian IPOs data. Prior studies on gender mainly focus on established listed companies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance practices or mechanisms and firm value, as measured by accounting and market data. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least square analyses were performed on a sample of 355 observations from 199 Canadian listed companies. The greater variability allowed under the Canadian principles-based institutional setting than under the rules-based USA SOX environment is well-suited for these tests. Findings: Results suggest that some governance practices, namely the percentage of independent directors on the board, the use of stock options and the frequency of board meetings are significantly and negatively related to the firm's net book value or income. However, most individual governance practices appear to have no significant impact on the firms' market value. Research limitations/implications: The potential interrelationships between corporate governance practices and contextual variables are not specifically taken into account, except for the firms' industrial sector. It is also possible that certain governance mechanisms jointly impact firm value. Practical implications: This study does not support the current emphasis by regulators on governance practices which mainly concern the monitoring function of the board as opposed to its strategic one. Originality/value: The paper uses Canada as a laboratory where companies are "invited" rather than "required" to follow corporate governance best practices. This greater corporate discretion in the choice of governance practices provides the variability necessary to test the effect of governance on firm value. Furthermore, in the interest of triangulation, a model seldom seen in the governance literature is used to examine the impact of governance mechanisms on firm value and performance, as measured by accounting and market data.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) turnover and firm performance and the moderating effects of ownership structure and board structure with respect to listed non-financial companies in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: Logit model is employed to analyze the relationship between CEO turnover and firm performance. Findings: The paper finds that both ownership and board structure have effects on the relationship between CEO turnover and firm performance. The probability of CEO turnover is lower when the firm is controlled by family, the CEO is part of the controlling family, and board size is larger. Contrary to previous studies, sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance is higher with the presence of CEO duality and lower degree of board independence. When a CEO continues to work beyond retirement age, the probability of turnover is not associated with firm performance. Originality/value: This study provides evidence that CEO duality and low independent board is not necessarily bad corporate governance practice for Thai companies and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, practitioners, and academic researchers.

This paper develops a theoretical analysis of performance measurement systems (including related accounting standards) and the composition of the Board in the context of business models driven by complementarities, innovation and intangibles. Performance management systems frame and shape the representation of business performance and risk, while the composition of the Board is designed to control and govern the business processes and disclosure of information over time. Complementarities, intangibles and innovation exacerbate the information asymmetry that characterizes the specific economy of the business firm, making it different from external markets. Therefore, firm-specific information becomes as important as market prices to gauge the past and future performance and risk of the ongoing business firm. Specific knowledge of the firm is therefore required to disclose relevant and reliable information and to monitor corporate executives. This argues for the role of improved historical cost accounting systems coupled with non-independent, proficient Board members. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this paper is to determine the factors that explain voluntary improvements in audit committee activity, independence and financial expertise, both individually and jointly, within a corporate governance environment other than those used in previous works. These audit committee characteristics have been selected because previous authors have found that these attributes improve the effectiveness of this monitoring committee. The findings included a relatively high level of the proxies of audit committee effectiveness for those companies which display the best practices in terms of their board of directors' independence and activities. At the same time, we observed a non-linear relationship of substitution among internal control mechanisms, management ownership and audit committee characteristics. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The objective of the study is to analyze corporate governance practices of Canadian companies in the post-Enron period. The attempt is to investigate whether the convergence phenomenon evidenced in prior studies is limited to the minimum mandatory requirements imposed by regulators or reflects a real behavioral transformation. Design/methodology/approach: Changing governance structure might be slow except in times of financial crisis, increased public scrutiny and reforms. These conditions are met in the post-Enron period (2002 to 2005) where major reforms have been launched including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in the USA and Bill 198 in Canada. The authors expect changes in corporate governance to be more important during this period, therefore, enhancing the robustness and reliability of their results. They measure corporate governance on a global scale, relying on the ROB index published by the Globe and Mail. The index distinguishes between four blocks of corporate governance, namely, board composition, compensation, shareholder rights, and disclosure. Findings: The present results show signs of convergence. However, Canadian companies improved their corporate governance practices in the post-Enron period mainly in areas mandated by regulation. This includes provisions related to the composition, attributes and working of the board of directors and board committees. No significant improvement is found in non-regulated governance best practices. Research limitations/implications: Overall, the findings suggest a lack of real behavioral change in corporate leaders. Instead, convergence in corporate governance appears to be the result of a box-checking exercise. Practical implications: If corporate governance is about ethical conduct and stems from the culture and mindset of management, these results show that corporate governance cannot be regulated by legislation alone. Originality/value: This study goes beyond the minimum mandatory requirements and looks into compliance of non-regulated provisions as well. Examining the evolution of corporate governance practices on these two fronts helps to further investigate the extent and nature of convergence. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper explores the factors influencing the board composition of an international sample of commercial banks over the period 1996-2006. After considering the dual role of the board as monitor and advisor, our analysis shows that no one board composition is optimal for the banking industry and that any such recommendation could harm bank governance. Our results suggest that more complex banks that have a low ownership concentration and are headquartered in a civil law country should have larger and more independent boards.

This paper aims to present evidence that the adoption by Japanese firms of a shareholder-oriented, more transparent, system of corporate governance creates greater corporate value in comparison to the traditional system of statutory auditors. This study uses panel data of Tokyo Stock Exchange listed companies to explore the potential convergence of corporate governance systems by examining the value differences between Japanese firms selecting one of two legal systems. A random-effects panel regression is used to analyze the data. The dependent variable of the study is Tobin's q. This paper finds a significant increase in firm valuation, as measured by Tobin's q, for companies that adopted the alternative of the Anglo-American type committee system, even though comparative financial data show little difference in performance after adoption. This finding is attributed to signal sending, as companies that adopted this system signal a choice toward transparency via monitoring by outsiders, suggesting a reduction of asymmetric agency costs. The paper finds that the committee corporate governance system produces higher corporate value than the traditional auditor governance. The study also finds evidence that it is the signal provided by adoption of the credible system, not the financial performance variables, that accounts for this difference. The data support the central idea that corporate governance laws have consequences and encourages additional study of the effects of corporate signaling and the consequences of increased shareholder orientation of agents. This paper takes advantage of the unique opportunity afforded by Japan's introduction of a dual system of corporate governance in 2003, when companies were offered a choice to adopt a new system of outside directors, which is a shareholder-oriented committee system. It establishes that firm value can be created by a signal that corporate governance provides. (c) 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to study if and how the evaluation of the boards in the top Nordic male football clubs affects the boards' composition and work. Design/methodology/approachThe study includes all the clubs in the two top divisions in each of the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The study makes use of a questionnaire where 66 (out of 145) chairmen answer 17 questions concerning the board composition and work on a five-point Likert-scale. FindingsThe responses were related to whether the board is annually evaluated or not. Descriptive statistics demonstrates that more than half of the clubs have an annual board evaluation. Most common is that the Chairman performs the evaluation himself/herself with help from designated board members; the evaluation being performed through informal discussions. A total of 44 clubs have a nominee committee. Almost all of the clubs transfer the result of the board evaluation to its nominee committee, most commonly verbally. Furthermore, results show that board evaluation has a significant positive effect on the following functions of football boards: review of business plan, strategy, objective and budget; discussion on short-term development; discussion on long-term development; and work efficiency. Originality/valueThe results of this study are consistent with a similar study of listed Nordic companies. The main difference between the results of the two studies is that clubs, unlike publicly listed companies, almost always perform the evaluation through internal interviews rarely using external consultants and individual anonymous questionnaires.

This study offers to regulators and practitioners evidence on the role of the board of directors' composition in the financial distress of family businesses in an emerging economy such as Lebanon. The paper examines the role of outside directors, insiders' equity ownership, and CEO-board chair duality on the financial distress of non-listed family-owned firms. Between the periods of 2007-2010, the authors investigate 276 firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group, using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance. Empirical results based on a longitudinal sample indicate that (1) the presence of outside directors on the board of directors has no effect on financial distress; and (2) insiders' equity ownership reduceod of financial distress; whereas, (3) the CEO-board chair duality increases the probability of financial distress of Lebanese family businesses. The findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators towards a selective implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance of one of the pillar of the Lebanese economy. The replacement of an inside director by an outsider will not increase the chance of survival of familyowned firms. In contrast, equity ownership held by insiders and the separation of the CEO-Chairperson position can be used as a tool to reduce agency costs, and as a result, enhance the financial performance.

This paper examines the role of institutional investors in improving firm performance through the channel of corporate investment decisions. We find that the interaction effect between institutional ownership and capital expenditures is significantly related to firm performance. We examine this relationship for different types of institutional investors, and find that investment advisors are most effective monitors in improving firm performance through corporate investment. Moreover, we find that the monitoring role of institutional investors becomes more important when internal governance is weak. Institutional ownership and other forms of corporate governance mechanisms (including CEO incentive compensation and control, shareholder right provisions, and board of director monitoring) operate as substitutes, rather than complements, in improving capital expenditure decisions.

Few decisions made by firms receive more consistent annual attention by the board of directors than dividend policy. For 60 years, financial economists have focused on deriving an optimal dividend policy. Energy utilities have been through a decade-long harvest period, but are now re-entering an above-trend investment growth phase. Utility dividend policies therefore require careful re-evaluation.

This paper investigates the level of compliance of several recommendations regarding board of directors included in the Code of Corporate Governance for Spanish listed firms and their determinants during the period 2007-2008. The results show that compliance is positively related to board independence and the presence of women on the board.

Institutional investors typically hold large blocks of assets and are thus thought capable of realizing the benefits of monitoring managers' activities. Yet, the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) environment is characterized by high free-rider costs and low incentives to monitor. Given this environment, institutions may choose to invest in firms with beneficial governance mechanisms in place. This study examines the impact of board composition and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) influence on the level of institutional investment and asks whether the existence of beneficial governance mechanisms is important in determining which REITs attract investment. After conducting Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions, a quasi-maximum likelihood model is estimated to resolve the problems associated with linear estimation of a fractional dependent variable. Robustness checks include re-estimating the models with the sample split into three size panels, and employing instrumental variables to control for potential endogeneity effects. The results are consistent with a preference for greater liquidity, increased free cash flow, less debt and lower dividend yield. Institutional investment is greater when boards of directors are busier and less tenured, which supports a preference for well connected yet less entrenched directors. Institutions prefer less equity ownership by the CEO, indicative of a preference for reduced CEO influence and increased governance. (c) 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Corporate boards of directors play a central role in the corporate governance of modern companies. Post Enron's, sweeping regulatory changes were made, particularly regarding the role of directors in the SOX Act, 2002. Such far reaching reforms have not been witnessed in the past 70 years of corporate governance history (Byrenes, 2003). In India, in line with these regulations, Narayanamurthy Committee's report of SEBI came into force in 2006. This study examines the relationship between board size and firm valuations of companies listed in the BSE 100 index covering a five year period, 2004-05 to 2008-09, using the framework of panel data methodology. In the Indian context the results are in consonance with similar studies showing a positive impact of larger board sizes on firm valuations measured by Tobin's Q. (c) 2012, SAGE Publications Ltd.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

Developing economies that are subject to global influences, such as through exposure to global product, labor and capital markets, may be expected to practice higher standards of corporate governance (CG) than less globalized developing economies. This paper seeks to understand the relationship between CG and firm ownership by private equity investors in India, and to understand whether CG practices in particular national institutional contexts change when the firm is exposed to investors with a background in other countries' institutional contexts. Taking India as a test case, the paper aims to explore how CG standards are affected by private equity investment that originates from developed countries. A primary survey on Indian firms' CG practices for firms that receive private equity and for comparable firms that do not was used to determine differences in CG. Private equity investors were surveyed to determine their national institutional contexts. The CG practices were then related to the national institutional context that the private equity investors came from. Private-equity funded firms display higher standards of corporate governance than firms that do not receive such funding. The difference arises from the application of developed country standards of CG arising from the investors that own the private equity funds. These funds are primarily owned by developed country investors. The strategies through which these occur are: reconstituting the board of directors, influencing senior executive recruitment, and changing the firm's operating and strategic rules. Developing countries like India usually display low standards of CG. Such standards tend to evolve slowly in line with the country's stage of development. The literature has not hitherto identified ways in which this process can be hastened. This study finds that standards can be raised above the prevailing standards through the governance practices imported into developing countries by private equity funds that are primarily owned by developed country investors. Hence, the findings of this paper contribute to the understanding of how globalization influences CG. (c) 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Purpose: Takeovers create a potential conflict of interest between target shareholders and directors. While mergers generally create value for the target shareholders, their directors will typically lose their board seats and likely face a financial loss or loss of prestige. The purpose of this paper is to examine evidence to support or refute that directors may act in their own best interests at the expense of shareholders. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reason that if directors act in their own best interests, then acquiring firms will seek targets with older board members who are closer to director retirement and are therefore less reluctant to give up their board seats. The paper uses data of 528 banks between 1999 and 2004 to estimate logistic regressions controlling for variables relevant to takeover probability. In the hypotheses, the authors test for the significance of the average director age on a board. Findings: The paper finds a highly positive significant relation between the average age of a board of directors and the probability of takeover. Furthermore, this variable is more robust and has greater explanatory power in predicting takeover targets than all other financial, ownership and governance variables commonly controlled for and included in this study. This suggests that older directors are less prone to agency problems and more willing to make decisions that will likely result in the loss of their board seat. Practical implications: These findings have important policy implications on director retirement policies such as director age versus term limits. The results also have implications on the use of director golden parachutes. Finally, the authors highlight a strategic consideration for acquiring firms seeking takeover targets. Originality/value: This paper is the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to document board age as an important governance characteristic. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Managers working for multinational firms must evaluate the extent to which they should adapt corporate governance mechanisms to local markets or to pursue a one-size-fits-all approach. In 1999, the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance were endorsed by OECD ministers in an attempt to influence policymakers worldwide by setting global governance standards. Yet the level of approval and understanding of these principles in non-OECD nations is still unclear. In this study we develop and test a survey instrument in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to assess perceptions of OECD principles by 168 Saudi Arabian managers. Results suggest that Saudi Arabian perceptions of shareholder rights are positively related to a) maintaining an effective corporate governance framework and b) the effective monitoring of management by the board of directors. Managerial implications and future research directions are also discussed. (c) 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

This paper examines the impact of board of directors (BOD) on corporate performance in value addition efficiency (VAE) of resources in an emerging economy namely Thailand in the context of post Asian financial crisis 1997/1998 period. This research uses data of top, as per market capitalisation, listed companies in Thailand for 2005 and 2008 to test the relationship. The study measures VAE of resources using Pulic's value added intellectual coefficient (VAICTM) model. The results find the impact of different BOD attributes on VAE of resources in top Thai companies, which is increasing over the post Asian crisis period. However, the study do not find significant impact of all BOD attributes on VAE which indicates the juvenile state of the BOD's effectiveness in achieving sustainable corporate performance. Managers and the policy makers may use the results to understand the complicated magnitude of BOD governance and its effectiveness in top companies in emerging economy, which might have the implication in developing more effective corporate governance structure in order to tackle the adverse effects of any further financial crisis.

This article examines the influence of Remuneration and Nomination Committees (RNCs) on the design of remuneration policies applied to executive board members of Spanish listed firms. We analyze whether the degree of the RNCs' independence or relevance affects the remuneration received by executive board members. Contrary to the expected results, our study suggests that both the independence and relevance of RNCs -the latter being proxied by its members' ownership stake and its relative size in comparison with the board- increase executive remuneration. Additionally, the firm's size, risk and the existence of investment opportunities are identified as determinants of the remuneration received by executive board members. (c) 2011 ACEDE.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This study tests the thesis of convergence between the Continental European model and the Anglo-Saxon one. To do so, we use the social network analysis to conduct a comparative study between the networks formed by firms listed on the IGBM index in Spain, and those listed on the FTSE 100 index in the United Kingdom, both in 2009. Our results support the convergence hypothesis as we find that financial corporations have disappeared from the central positions of Spanish networks of firms, and the number of privatized firms in central positions of the networks is similar to the British case.

This paper studies the influence of internal corporate governance mechanisms - ownership concentration, board of directors, and indebtedness - on firm performance, and if such mechanisms depend on institutional frameworks. Based on a sample of 765 companies from seven countries of the European Union over a four-year period (2000-2003), we found that firm performance tends to increase as ownership is concentrated, protection to investors gets stronger, and indebtedness levels decrease, as well as the size of the board of directors. Moreover, in order to analyze the joint effect of the institutional framework and the mechanism of government, we found evidence that the legal protection offered to investors in each country determines the use of internal governance mechanisms. Also, our findings show that the estimated impact of corporate governance variables on firm performance more than doubles when discretionary accruals are eliminated from measured profitability.

Target firms often face a takeover threat from raiders with prior stakes in its ownership (toeholds). Previous literature has shown that, when takeovers are modeled as standard auctions, toeholds induce more aggressive bids from raiders, which has two important consequences for the selling process: (i) the board of directors is no longer indifferent about the sale procedure used to get the highest price, and (ii) the target may not be assigned to the highest-value raider. This paper characterizes how the price-maximizing procedure should be in the presence of asymmetric toeholds. Our central result is that the optimal rule needs to be implemented by a discriminatory mechanism quite different from conventional auction formats. By imposing an extra-charge against high-toehold bidders, the optimal mechanism is able to extract more surplus from raiders who bid more aggressively. As a result, nonbidding shareholders benefit unambiguously from the toehold asymmetry. Furthermore, as this bias restores the symmetry in bidders' expected payoffs, the proposed mechanism also allows to allocate efficiently the target among them. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Chung-Hua Shen and Yuan Chang 25.1 INTRODUCTION The worldwide surge in corporate social responsibility (CSR) shows that companies are becoming increasingly worried about the impact of their business activities on society.1 More and more firms highlight their CSR activities, which aim to balance their business operations with the concerns of external stakeholders such as customers, unions, local communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments. Thus, although generating profits is important, the social and environmental consequences of operations are also weighed against economic gains. Corporate governance and CSR are both extraordinarily important to a corporation. This is because corporate governance involves a set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions which affect the way in which a company is directed, administered or controlled. It also includes the relationships among the many stakeholders involved and the goals for which the corporation is governed. The principal stakeholders are the shareholders, the management and the board of directors, and other stakeholders include employees, customers, creditors, suppliers, regulators and the community at large. Thus, companies with well-formed corporate governance systems take care of most CSR issues. CSR is not separate from corporate governance. For example, good corporate governance is basically concerned with making better decisions for the long-term health of the company, such as enhancing the brand value of a company. Taking care of CSR is like taking care of risk management, where the risk is related to the value of a company brand. The 2008 Chinese milk scandal is a notable example.2 Taking care of....

This paper examines whether efficiency monitoring has a positive influence on corporate performance by using the fixed effect model with panel data of listed firms in Taiwan from 2005 to 2010. The results show that having a shared interest group, formed by the controlling shareholders of a company and its board directors, leads to a failing monitoring function of the board of directors. Moreover, greater divergence between the number of board seats controlled and voting rights leads to a higher likelihood of corporate performance appearing to be an inverted curve. If this divergence exceeds a certain threshold, the interests of external shareholders may be harmed by large shareholders.Copyright (c) 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates the link between board structure and firm performance. The impact of conglomerate diversification on the relationship between board effectiveness and firm performance is also examined. Boards of director effectiveness, including board composition, board size, institutional ownership, and aspects of board leadership including CEO duality are addressed in the Tunisian context. The study employs a dynamic model to study twenty-eight non-banking companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange over the period 1997-2003. The empirical results are mixed and are consistent with previous studies particularly in the Tunisian context. Evidence was found that conglomerate diversification is negative and statistically significant to both board effectiveness and firm performance, which increases the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders and leads to the expropriation of minority shareholders rights. These findings have several implications for understanding the opportunistic behavior of managers. (c) 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study investigates variables that influence director compensation of listed Taiwanese companies using the new disclosure rule for director compensation. We divided the compensation from its structure into three types: non-incentive compensation, incentive compensation, and total compensation. This study collected the research samples of companies listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2007. Using multiple regression analysis, we investigated the variables, which influenced the director compensation. Our results show that the amount of director compensation is influenced by the relative performance of the industry. These companies considered performance level of competitors or the whole industry. The monitoring effect of inside directors can reduce agency conflicts. The company will lower the levels of director compensation to avoid the inefficiency of its directors. It should also be noted that the outside monitoring effect and director compensation are complementary to each other in governing the company and the board of directors. If the active institutional investors of a company have a high percentage of ownership, the levels of director compensation would be relatively high. When the company has a high level of future growth, then the shareholders will encourage directors to monitor the company vigorously and contribute to future developments of the company by an increased director compensation.

Our work provides an analysis of the interaction effects between internal governance mechanisms on the components of initial returns during the listing period. The application of multivariate regressions on a sample of 110 IPO French companies during 2005-2010, has allowed us to conclude that the different interactions between these mechanisms significantly influence the level of under / overpricing. Indeed, the positive relationship between internal governance mechanisms and overpricing reflects a substitutability relationship. In contrast, the complementarity effect comes from the negative relationship characterizing the combination of governance mechanisms and the underpricing. Thus, the interactions effects between institutional ownership, board structure and under / overpricing are not conforming to the existence of a complementarity or substitutability relationship between these variables given the absence of a significant combination between these variables.

In order to solve the agency problems and improve the management efficiency of board of directors, this paper, selecting A-share 1399 listed companies as samples, studied the relation between board characteristics and agency costs, which was measured by total asset turnover rate and overhead expenses rate, using multiple regression analysis. This paper obtains results as follows. Board size and frequency of board meetings have a U-shaped correlation to agency costs. There is no statistically significance between proportion of independent directors and agency costs. Separation of chairman and general manager usually leads to low agency costs. The proportion of board members' share-holding has a negative correlation with the agency costs. Finally, this paper gives three suggestions to optimize board governance, involving independent directors, incentives and constraints and rules of procedure. (c) 2012 IEEE.

Due to recent economic and ethical scandals, in particular those revealed by the 2008 crisis, globalisation of investments will require credible management strategies able to reassure investors. Many traditional studies of corporate governance highlight the necessity for the board of directors to discipline their CEO, using incentive and direct supervision mechanisms. The financial scandals that continue to shake the economic sphere show that this approach has not proven to be effective. We have to question the classical paradigm that considers the CEO to be a passive actor. Opportunistic managerial behaviors are not the only causes of organisational abuses. Indeed, shareholders can ruin organisational value with short-term pressure. Our main hypothesis is that power and counter power are at the same time sources of acts and interactional constraints, creating a dynamic relational field between the shareholder and the CEO. Thus, a double agency relationship is proposed, specifically based on a double relationship of control between the Chairman of the Board and his CEO. (c) 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Dilek Demirbas, Andrey Yukhanaev and Roman Stepanov 22.1 INTRODUCTION All organizations around the world, regardless of either Western or Eastern origin, are currently undergoing significant changes. One of the major changes within these organizations is corporate governance, and these changes in corporate governance have become the focus of all related parties such as directors, investors, stakeholders and regulators. Indeed, Tricker (2000), considering the evolution of business environment and corporate development, postulated the following chronology: entrepreneurship as a nineteenth-century phenomenum, management prevalence as a catalytic force in the twentieth century and corporate governance as a leitmotif of modern times. The common conclusion of all parties involved is that companies across the world need to adopt commonly accepted corporate governance standards in order to attract foreign capital, to become internationally more competitive and to deal with corporate governance problems in today's economic environment. With the intention of providing the best and most commonly accepted international corporate governance standards, in 1999 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed an international corporate governance code and global principles of 'good' governance. In 2004, the OECD revised its previous attempt, Principles of Corporate Governance and defined 'good corporate governance'. Since the date of first publication, the OECD Principles (1999, 2004) have gained substantial recognition worldwide as a framework for reforms and a reference point for corporate governance literature. Now, there is a positive tendency among company directors around the world to support reforms, partly as a result of increasing international pressures to harmonize corporate....

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the effects of firm- and country-level "good" corporate governance prescriptions on firm performance before and during the recent financial crisis, using a large sample of 1,197 firms across 26 European countries. Research Findings/Insights: We propose a contextualized agency perspective suggesting that firm- and country-level good governance prescriptions designed to assure managerial oversight may not hold in a financial crisis. This is because firms can benefit from broadening managerial discretion so as to facilitate the exercise of initiative and decisive leadership. Overall, our firm- and country-level findings support this argument. In a crisis, CEO duality is associated with better performance. We also find that the use of incentive compensation and the existence of a wedge between ownership and control rights negatively impacts on firm performance in a crisis. Hierarchical linear modeling shows that 25 percent of the heterogeneity in firm performance is among countries, indicating the importance of including country-level institutions in our analyses. In a crisis, we find that the general quality of the legal system and creditor rights protection are positively related to firm performance, but protection for equity investors is not. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The findings challenge the universality of good governance prescriptions and contribute to the growing body of work proposing that the efficacy of governance mechanisms may be contingent upon organizational and environmental circumstances. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study offers insights relevant to policy and practitioner communities, showing that governance mechanisms operate differently in crisis and non-crisis periods. The tendency to respond to a crisis with more stringent rules may be counterproductive since such measures may compromise executives' ability to respond appropriately to systemic shocks. Practitioners are encouraged to optimize rather than maximize their governance choices. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore how the combinations of firm-level corporate governance (CG) practices embedded in different national governance systems lead to high firm performance. Research Findings/Insights: Using fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis, we uncover a variety of findings. First, we show that within each of the stylized national CG models, there are multiple bundles of firm-level governance practices leading to high firm performance (i.e., equifinality). Second, we provide evidence of complementarity as well as functional equivalence between CG practices. Finally, we demonstrate that there can be heterogeneity ("differences in kind") in firm governance practices within each stylized model of CG. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the configurational and complementarity-based approaches to make the following theoretical claims. First, governance practices within firm bundles do not always relate to each other in a monotonic and cumulative fashion as this entails higher costs and possibly over-governance. Second, practices in bundles do not need to be aligned toward the insider or the outsider model ("similar in kind"). We argue that non-aligned practices can also be complementary, creating hybrid governance forms. Third, we predict functional equivalence across bundles of CG practices which grants firms agency on which of the practices to implement in order to achieve high performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We contribute to comparative CG research by demonstrating that there are multiple governance paths leading to high firm performance, and that these practices do not always belong to the same national governance tradition. Therefore, our findings alert of the perils of "one size fits all" governance solutions when designing and implementing CG policies. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate board size and promoter ownership on firm value for selected Indian companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyses the corporate governance structure of 176 Indian firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange using linear regression analysis. Findings: The empirical findings show a negative relationship of board size with firm value and significant positive association of promoter ownership with corporate performance. The study suggests that only above a critical ownership level of 40 percent does promoter's interest become aligned with that of the company, resulting in positive effect on firm value. Research limitations/ implications: The research has been limited to some selected Indian companies, with focus only on board size and promoter ownership as predictor variables. The study suggests that corporate governance reforms in India and introduction of non-executive independent directors to the board have resulted in diminishing effect of board size on the firm value. Practical implications: The study implies that for emerging economies like India, it is practical to have greater ownership control by promoters to enhance company value. Also, it is not advisable to have a board size above certain limit. Originality/value: The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size and promoter ownership.

This study examines the effect of family management, ownership, and control on capital structure for 523 Colombian firms between 1996 and 2006. The study finds that debt levels tend to be lower for younger firms when the founder or one of his heirs acts as manager, but trends higher as the firm ages. When family involvement derives from direct and indirect ownership, the family-debt relationship is positive, consistent with the idea that external supervision accompanies higher debt levels and reduces the risk of losing control. When families are present on the board of directors (but are not in management), debt levels tend to be lower, suggesting that family directors are more risk-averse. The results stress the tradeoff between two distinct motivations that determine the capital structure of family firms: risk aversion pushes firms toward lower debt levels, but the need to finance growth without losing control makes family firms to prefer higher debt levels.

This paper investigates the effect of corporate governance practices on the extent of voluntary disclosure in France. Using a panel of 206 non-financial French listed firms during the period 2006-2009, we find evidence that voluntary disclosure in annual reports increases with managerial ownership, board and audit committee independence, board meeting frequency, and external audit quality. We also find that frequency of audit committee meetings and diligence of board and auditing are associated with decreased disclosure. Additional findings show that larger, more profitable, and less indebted firms have greater voluntary disclosure.

Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to examine the influence of the educational qualifications of board members, including the CEO, on the financial performance of Indonesian listed firms. Indonesia is a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a sample comprising 160 firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) are used as measures of financial performance. It uses four proxies for board members' educational qualifications, namely postgraduate degrees, degrees obtained from prestigious universities, degrees obtained from developed countries, and degrees in financial disciplines. Regressions are performed separately for the supervisory board, management board, and CEO. Findings - This study provides empirical evidence that the educational qualifications of board members and the CEO matter, to a particular extent, in explaining either ROA or Tobin's Q. For example, CEOs holding degrees from prestigious domestic universities perform significantly better than those without such qualifications. Practical implications - Even though intellectual competence should appear to be one of the considerations in the appointment of board members, educational qualification is not always a good proxy for superior advising or managerial quality. There may be many other factors that need to be considered, such as experiences, managerial skills, networks, and other skills obtained outside schools. As such, the establishment of a nomination committee, which is expected to provide independent recommendations on qualified candidates to serve in the boardrooms, plays an important role. Originality/value - Empirical studies focusing on the influence of the educational backgrounds of board members and the CEO on financial performance are still rare in the literature. This study is among the first to address such an issue in the context of a developing economy. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

While most economic organisation literature on cooperatives has focused on changes in income rights, we study changes in the allocation of decision rights between board of directors (representing members) and managers. The traditional role of the board is to direct the activities of the managers. However, professional management increasingly makes most strategic decisions, pushing the board into a supervisory role. We present two groups of findings on changing board-management relationships. We identify three corporate governance models: traditional, management and corporation. And we present an empirical illustration showing a relationship between the choice of board model, and product portfolio and performance. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore disclosure on corporate governance mechanisms in annual reports of Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - Employing a sample comprising seven Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia, the present study constructs the so-called Corporate Governance Disclosure Index (CGDI) to score the banks' disclosure level. Corporate governance mechanisms addressed in this study include Shariah Supervisory Board, the Board of Commissioners, the Board of Directors, board committees, internal control and external audit, and risk management. Findings - It is revealed that Bank Muamalat and Bank Syariah Mandiri, the county's two largest and oldest Islamic commercial banks, score higher than their peers. Disclosure of the sample banks on some dimensions, such as board members and risk management, is found to be strong. On the other hand, disclosure on internal control and board committees tends to be weak. Practical implications - This study shows that the average disclosure level among the sample banks is relatively low. Hence, this result has important implications for the enhancement of corporate governance disclosure of Islamic banks, thereby wider acceptance and enhanced reputation could be gained. Originality/value - This paper is believed to be among the first to explore the practice of disclosure on corporate governance mechanisms among Islamic commercial banks. Additionally, it focuses on Indonesia, the largest Muslim country that has a different institutional setting from that in other Muslim countries. (c) 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Direct transfer (Type I tunneling) means that the controlling shareholders transfer resources from the firm for their own benefit. This study aims to investigate the impact of internal and external governance mechanisms from the perspective of principal-principal (P-P) conflicts on Type I tunneling. Research Findings/Insights: Using hand-collected data comprising 117 Chinese listed companies with 540 firm-year observations during 2001-2005, the results show that state ownership and the number of board of directors' meetings are positively correlated with Type I tunneling, whereas the number of independent directors reveals a negative association. Other internal governance mechanisms including foreign ownership, the size of the board of directors, supervisory board size, number of professional supervisors, and the number of supervisory board meetings were found to have no impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Several implications can be drawn. First, this study has modeled tunneling using a well-accepted theoretical perspective - agency theory of P-P conflicts. But the results show that agency theory does not appropriately explain tunneling behavior in China and so institutional theory is suggested as an alternative theoretical perspective for future research. Second, corporate governance reforms relating to supervisory boards have not been sufficient to ensure that they properly fulfill their role of oversight. Rather, such supervisory boards are perhaps playing more of a "rubber stamp" role. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study recommends prescribing the legal responsibilities and obligations for two-tier boards in the Chinese context, allowing them to undertake their duties diligently.

This study investigates the link between female board directors and company financial performance and agency costs in Sri Lanka's publicly listed companies. In order to investigate the impact of board gender diversity on firm financial performance, a dynamic panel generalised method of moment estimation is applied. Three variables are used as proxies for gender diversity of the board of directors, namely the percentage of women on the board, a dichotomous dummy and the Blau index. A Tobit model with endogenous regressors is used to investigate the impact of female board members on agency cost, using growth opportunities as a measure of agency cost. After controlling for size, industry and other corporate governance measures, this study finds a significant negative relationship between the proportion of women on boards and firm value along with an increase in company agency cost. This evidence provides insights for governments and academic institutions in their efforts to provide resources that will help enhance women's leadership skills.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

I hypothesize and find that earnings management via accruals is driven partially by the prevailing market-wide investor sentiment. Managers inflate earnings in periods of higher sentiment, but report more conservatively during periods of low sentiment. Moreover, the likelihood of income-increasing earnings management to avoid negative earnings surprises is also positively associated with investor sentiment. These results are robust to: (i) controls for time-varying firm characteristics such as growth, investment opportunity sets, future profitability, leverage and size; (ii) macroeconomic variables such as future inflation, GDP growth, and growth in industrial production; (iii) multiple proxies for investor sentiment; and (iv) discretionary revenues as alternative measure of earnings management. Cross-sectional analyses reveal that firms whose stock returns co-move more with investor sentiment are more (less) likely to manage earnings upward via abnormal accruals in quarters of higher (lower) sentiment. The findings of managers' strategic use of abnormal accruals show the need for increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to heightened managerial incentives to overstate earnings and to report optimistic earnings numbers during periods of high investor sentiment.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

This study aims to examine the relationship between board composition (i.e. nonexecutive directors, family directors, role duality and board size) and bank performance, using a sample of nine listed Kuwait banks over the 2006 to 2010 period. The study uses ordinary least squares (OLS) and twostageleast squares (2SLS) to test such a relationship and to address endogeneity in explanatory variables. The results provide some evidence that board composition of banks relates to their performance. According to the OLS regression results, only board size and proportion of nonexecutive directors negatively affect bank performance. Meanwhile, the 2SLS results indicate that role duality positively affects a bank's performance while board size affects a bank's performance negatively. Although the model has explained a significant part of the variation in performance, still unexplained is a material part that represents the "noise" of the model. Data availability limited the ability to study other aspects of corporate governance mechanisms such as number of audit committee members on board. The sample size is small; thus, in future research, the sample size could be increased by including a longer period of time or different countries such as members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia). Given the importance of effective boards in monitoring bank values, more actions and rules need to take place in Kuwait to improve the efficacy of boards in protecting shareholders and their interests in Kuwaiti banks. Regulators may mandate a corporate governance code or adopt the OECD corporate governance principles as a starting point in Kuwait. Kuwaiti companies may use the findings to make appropriate choices about board appointments and best governance to improve performance. Investors also may use the findings to understand Kuwaiti companies. Such findings may assist them to diversify their investment portfolios. This study asserts to provide insights on the relationship between bank performance and board composition in Kuwait. The study extends prior research and investigates the roles of board of directors in banks in the context of an emerging market characterized by weak shareholder protection and highly concentrated ownership.

It is hypothesized in this study that the relationship between institutional ownership and inventory management is more likely to be moderated by other internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e., managerial ownership, board leadership structure and board size). This is more likely to happen as one weak governance mechanism in one area will be offset by a strong one in another area. Furthermore, the effectiveness of one corporate governance mechanism (i.e., institutional ownership) is more likely to be contingent on some contextual variables. Econometric analysis, using a sample of Egyptian listed firms, provides strong evidence for the applicability of this theme and demonstrates that institutional ownership affects inventory management positively (negatively) when managerial ownership is high (low), CEO duality (non-duality) is in place, or board size is large (small). This conclusion is robust to the use of different control variables and econometric models. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study examines the relationship between the quality of financial information disclosed and governance mechanisms on certain features of the board, ownership structure and control system for French companies listed on the SBF 250 for a period of five years from 2004 to 2008. The quality of financial information is approximated by the discretionary accruals and with a disclosure index with 78 items. The result shows a positive effect of certain variables such as the size of the board of directors, the members' attendance at Board meetings and the presence of the Big 4 and the presence of a dual listing.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction effect of auditor industry specialization and board governance on earnings management. This study examines whether board independence is more or less effective in constraining earnings management for firms audited by industry specialists than for firms audited by non-specialists. Design/methodology/approach: The US data were collected from the RiskMetrics Directors database and the Compustat database. Regression analysis was used to test the research proposition. Findings: It was found that earnings management is more negatively associated with board independence for firms audited by industry specialists than for firms audited by non-specialists, consistent with the notion that there is a complementary relationship between auditor industry specialization and board governance. The findings suggest a positive interaction effect of auditor industry specialization and board governance on accounting quality. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by documenting explicit evidence that high quality boards can be more effective through hiring industry specialist auditors. This study also suggests that it may be worth investigating the interaction effect among different corporate governance mechanisms on accounting quality. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

This paper examines the determinants of thinly capitalized structures of publicly-listed Australian firms. Based on a hand-collected sample of 203 publicly-listed Australian firms over the 2006-2009 period (812 firm-years), our regression results indicate that the thin capitalization position of firms is significantly and positively associated with multinationality, tax haven utilization, withholding taxes and tax uncertainty. Multinationality and the use of tax havens are, in particular, strongly associated with thin capitalization. Our additional regression results provide evidence that shows that corporate governance monitoring mechanisms relating to board of director independence, institutional ownership and big-4 auditor utilization are significantly negatively associated with firms adopting thinly capitalized tax avoidance structures.

Since the beginnings of the global debate over corporate governance in the early 1990s, academics, practitioners and policymakers have focused on changing boards of directors to improve corporate governance. The financial crisis of 2007-09 arose despite two decades of codification of corporation governance, a process that continues in the light of concern about corporate performance and accountability: codes have not eliminated the problems they set out to address. Analysing the three main versions of the UK code of corporate governance, we see a shifting discourse of 'structures' in Cadbury to 'independence' under the reforms in 2003, and then in the 2010 iteration towards 'behaviour', as the code seeks to improve boards as mechanisms of corporate governance. The evolution in the language and recommendations of the code reveals growing understanding both of the practical challenge of board effectiveness and of the limitations to codification.

This paper focuses on a mechanism through which foreign investors affect corporate policy in emerging economies. We hypothesize that foreign investors who provide effective monitoring may affect corporate policy through pushing for a greater proportion of outsiders or foreigners on the board of directors who are less affiliated with controlling shareholders. Using the unique features of foreign ownership in Korea, we find that firms with an increase in foreign ownership are more likely to increase the fraction of outsiders and foreign directors on the board in the subsequent year. Increased board independence in response to a pressure from foreign investors results in a significant change in payout and investment policy. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the association between board characteristics and shareholders' assessment of their exposure to economic and agency risks as reflected in the volatility of stock returns. Our hypotheses incorporate prior evidence that small and large firms have 'dramatically' different board structures, reflecting the firms' different monitoring and advising needs. We hypothesize and find evidence that only the shareholders of well-established large firms are able to generate positive net benefits, in the form of lower equity risk, from independent boards and well-connected independent directors with multiple directorships. We also find professional and formal industry degree qualifications on the board are associated with shareholders' risk assessment for some small firms consistent with the focus of small firms on building growth and scale. While we find evidence that formal industry professional affiliations (weak evidence) and MBAs provide benefits for the shareholders of large firms, there is limited evidence that financial expertise on the board systematically influences shareholders' risk assessments for small or large companies. The key conclusion from the evidence in this paper is that a 'one size fits all' approach to governance in relation to the board of directors may not meet the diverse needs of companies at different stages of economic development.

The literature and many national regulatory frameworks have underlined the importance of audit committees as monitoring mechanisms. In the prevailing Italian firms' corporate governance system, there is no audit committee. Instead, its functions are responsibility of two different committees. One is the Internal Control Committee and the other the Board of Statutory Auditors. In this article, we try to understand whether the determinants of Audit Committee diligence, analyzed by the literature, affect both Internal Control Committee and Board of Statutory Auditor diligence in the firms listed on the Italian stock exchange over a three-year period (2005-2007).Regression analysis results show a lack of relation between Internal Control Committee diligence and the percentage of outsiders in the board, the percentage of independent directors in the board, CEO duality, and presence of blockholders. The results show that the board of director diligence has a positive effect on Internal Control Committee diligence. With regard to Board of Statutory Auditors, data show a lack of relation between its diligence and the percentage of outside directors in the board, CEO duality, and presence of blockholders. Data show a positive and significant relation between Board of Statutory Auditor diligence and both percentage of independent directors in the board and diligence of board of directors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this paper, we explore the determinants and performance effects of a novel measure of executive incentives, that is, the elasticity of a CEO's total wealth to firm performance, computed as a CEO's ownership value relative to her total wealth. Research Findings/Insights: Using unique data on the total personal wealth of the CEOs of listed Swedish firms, we find that while CEOs typically own only a very small fraction of the shares of their firms, this ownership often constitutes a significant part of their total wealth. We also find that a CEO's total wealth elasticity is negatively associated with firm size and a CEO's age is positively associated with a firm risk environment. As for the effect on firm performance, we find that higher CEO's equity incentives enhance future accounting firm performance, when we estimate panel data regressions by taking into account the dynamic nature of endogeneity between a CEO's incentives and firm performance. However, we do not find any evidence that a CEO's equity incentives to be related to future stock returns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our analysis suggests that executives' incentives when measured as price-performance elasticity are economically more significant than has been often argued in the literature. Moreover, due to several advantages of price-performance elasticity over traditionally used fractional ownership and dollar-at-stake measures, the inferences drawn from this study with respect to determinants and performance implications of a CEO's incentives may be superior to those from prior studies. The result on the relation between firm size and a CEO's incentives is especially interesting, because, unlike fractional ownership, the elasticity of a CEO's total wealth to firm performance is not spuriously related to firm size. With respect to the relation between incentives and subsequent firm performance, our results are consistent with the view that higher CEO's incentives, measured as price-performance elasticity, enhance firm accounting performance. Overall, future studies should consider price-performance elasticity as an alternative measure of executive incentives in addressing various research questions. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The evidence in this paper suggests that executive incentives calculated relative to their non-firm wealth are economically more meaningful if compared to the traditionally used measures. As such, compensation consultants and boards of directors can consider this alternative measure when designing executive compensation plans and determining an appropriate level of ownership, when the information on executive non-firm wealth is available.

Purpose: This paper deals with the relationship existing between the emotional aspect and decision-making processes. More specifically, it examines the links between emotional intelligence, decision biases and effectiveness of the governance mechanisms. The primary purposes of this paper are to: consider emotional intelligence as new research ideas that make important contributions to society; offer suggestions for improving manuscripts submitted to Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations; and discuss methods for enhancing the validity of inferences made from research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper explains that the main cause of organization's problems is CEO emotional intelligence level. The authors use three models (linear regression and logistic binary regression) to examine this relation: every model treats the relationship between emotional intelligence and one of efficiency criteria of the board. Emotional intelligence has been measured according to Schutte et al.'s Shutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Scale (SSREI), with a high internal validity level. The four cognitive biases have been measured by means of a questionnaire comprising several items and the selected sample was composed of some180 Tunisian executives (belonging to 60 firms). Findings: The results revealed that the presence of a high emotional intelligence rate is not always positively correlated with the executives' suggestibility with respect to behavioural biases. They have also affirmed the existence of a complementarity relationship between emotional intelligence and the directors' board. Authors need to consider that emotion which minimizes CEO emotional biases and provides director's board effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: This article has implications for the development of CEO emotional intelligence capacity. Also, some psychological aspects of a theoretical nature could not be wholly approached in a complete empirical way. Practical implications: The paper pushes organizations to select managers based on their levels of emotional intelligence (apply tests of emotional intelligence in place psychometric tests). Also, it increases the validity of inferences made from research in the field. Social implications: This paper incites governments to establish training programs aimed at the development of learning of emotional intelligence. Thus, it has important implications for enhancing the well-being of individuals, organizations and society as a whole. Originality/value: Actually, for the sake improving the explanatory power of a legal-financial approach of governance, the behavioural dimension has been integrated for a more thorough analysis of the directors' board role. The authors' goal consists in highlighting the role played by emotional intelligence as a skill or tool available for the manager or controller to minimize the behavioural biases (bias of loss aversion, optimism, over-confidence and lack of cognitive flexibility), and achieves an effective control.

This paper examines the influence and causal relationship between board of directors independence, CEO duality, and firm value. By estimating multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, there resulted a positive influence of the percentage of independent directors on firm value, but down to a threshold of their representation of 47.23 percent, whereupon their influence becomes negative. When we employed fixed-effects models, the relationship previously mentioned was not statistically validated. However, the results provide support for a lack of statistically significant relationship between the percentage of non-executive directors and firm value. Besides, by estimating fixed-effects models we found a positive influence of CEO duality on industry-adjusted Tobin's Q ratio, but not statistically significant when estimating models without cross-sectional effects. The causal relationships between board independence and firm value identified based on Granger causality are not robust. (c) 2013, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

We analyse the determinants of equity agency costs for the top 500 Australian listed firms. Data are collected over four one-year periods (2004, 2005, 2010 and 2011) and analysed using both pooled OLS regression and two stage least squares regression within a random effects panel data model. Analysis covers the full four-year period, the pre global financial crisis (GFC) sub-period (2004 and 2005) and the post GFC sub-period (2010 and 2011). Shareholding, board characteristics and debt financing are found to have an impact on agency costs though there is evidence of some change in these relations with the onset of the GFC, particularly with respect to the impact of insider ownership and board size.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to control for the interrelationships between corporate governance mechanisms. Managerial ownership, external block holders' ownership, board independence, leadership structure and the size of the board, are perceived as the set of ownership and board characteristics embraced to interact in a system of corporate dynamics, which mitigate agency costs. Design/methodology/approach: By using an extensive sample of Greek listed firms and by applying a simultaneous equations framework in order to control the potential endogeneity, the paper's findings indicate interdependence among these mechanisms. Findings: More specifically, companies whose CEO is also the chairman of the board tend to have fewer outside directors and lower block holder ownership. The paper also provides evidence that independent boards are more likely to be employed by firms with higher external block holder shareholdings and whose board size is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and board independence. Originality/value: The aim of this study is to examine the interrelationships among ownership structure and board characteristics in a small open economy, such as the Greek economy.

Purpose: If proficient boards result in better governance, as the literature on the subject generally suggests, engaging independent directors and having in place an effective audit committee would certainly facilitate productive corporate functioning and enhanced accountability. Motivated by such a viewpoint, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the reporting quality and performance of the Indian central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and its private counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The well premeditated propositions of the study resulted in a final sample comprising 47 CPSEs and 30 peer companies. The auditors' report on financial statements was scanned to determine the quality of company's accounting and financial reporting systems. The BSE-500 Index companies were ranked on select financial parameters to gauge relative performance of the sample companies. Findings: An analysis of the CPSEs shows that non-compliance with the corporate governance provisions with regards to the required number of independent directors on the board did not have any concomitant effect on their performance. Further, an examination of auditors' report revealed that the CPSEs provide a better insight into books of accounts, unlike the private sector. Originality/value: The study is timely and relevant, given the expanded role of the state and renewed interest in boards. A case for collaborative engagement between the government and the corporate sector is proposed to address legal as well as regulatory lacunae for building trust and fostering good corporate governance. To ensure better compliance and enforcement of financial regulations it envisions an integrated accounting/auditing and taxation administration platform. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper contrasts firm-level as opposed to state-level governance on directors self-rewarding behaviour in West Africa. Director self-reward or compensation is measured through fixed base salary as well as total remuneration which provides a conservative estimate of the full private benefits of control of directors. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 56 IPO firms from across West Africa from 2000 to 2012, I find that larger board sizes have less effective governance mechanisms while enhanced expropriation of private benefits of control is closely associated with lower government promotion of private sector policies, media and analyst freedom and corruption control.

Corporate Governance (CG) is not a new concept for the transition economies of the Middle East, but corporate governance is especially important since these economies do not have the long-established institutional infrastructure to deal with corporate governance issues. This article is presenting the results of our survey analyzing the status quo of Corporate Governance in Iranian companies. The survey questions cover aspects of Corporate Governance awareness, board of directors, control environment, transparency and shareholder- as well as stakeholder rights. We find several specifics that apply to other countries in the MENA region too. Empowering shareholders and stakeholder, offering Corporate Governance trainings and case studies in the region as well as establishing a culture of independent directors is the way forward.

In this study, we aim to provide a detailed overview of the characteristics of boards of directors (BoDs) in Brazil. We analyse 2023 resumes that we hand-collected from the board members of 315 public companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa). On the basis of this analysis, we highlight approximately 30 characteristics of BoDs, such as evaluation mechanisms, meeting frequency, independence and special committees. We highlight the rare presence of women on these boards and the limited presence of independent directors, although we also note that the majority of directors are outsiders. In the Brazilian context, more than 40 per cent of companies listed on the Bovespa are included in the special listing segments for corporate governance; more than 75 per cent of directors are named by the controlling shareholder, which exacerbates conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders. This study indicates that many public companies do not follow the recommendations of the IBGC (the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance) regarding various aspects of corporate governance. Finally, this study has practical implications for regulators, academics, government authorities and practitioners seeking to develop better incentive schemes for corporate governance in Brazil.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is examine governance and enterprise restructuring in Southeast Europe (SEE) (Western Balkans) transition economies. International organizations classify the following countries in SEE (Western Balkans): Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Design/methodology/approach - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has governance and enterprise restructuring as a basic indicator of economic transition and defines it as effective corporate governance and corporate control exercised through domestic financial institutions and markets, fostering market-driven restructuring. The corporate governance is most often defined in terms of the roles, responsibilities, and interactions of top management and the board of directors. Using data of SEE economies, the interrelationships between governance and enterprise restructuring and set of policies that influence the governance patterns will be examined. Findings - Due to the analysis of the first assumption where a relation was made between governance and enterprise restructuring and imposed set of policies, the results have shown that there are mixed outcomes. The second hypothesis analyzed the importance and progress of corporate governance and enterprise restructuring. Originality/value - The paper shows that the overall outcome of SEE countries is mixed, as there are significant improvements in some countries and noteworthy lags in others. Indeed, needed considerable improvement is needed in corporate governance, institution-building controlling agency problems and in imposing already adopted regulation; as well as adopting new ways of enterprise restructuring policies within existing policies of overall transition economy restructuring.

This study investigates the success factors that can influence the performance and the continuity of the French and Lebanese family firms. Based on the literature review, the performance of the family firms was found to be linked to effective success keys like the succession planning, networking strategy, financial structure, management practices and finally the governance structure. Effectively, the results of this study indicate that French family firms are linked to four success keys (Planning for Succession, Using of Emotional intelligence, Professional HR management and Long Term Overview) while the Lebanese family firms are linked to five success keys (Financial structure with low leverage, Planning for Succession, Using of Emotional intelligence, professional HR management and Governmental Networking). Due to the non-significant impact of governance structure, an advanced investigation has been applied to detect the impact of this variable on the performance of family firm. The results of this advanced study indicate a negative correlation between the performance of family firms and the board of directors' size. Moreover, a positive correlation has been found between family firm performance and the presence of the outsiders in the board of directors.

We investigate whether boards of directors adjust compensation contracts to lengthen a CEO's decision horizon, and if the use of such contract adjustments depends on the levels of external (i.e., shareholder-based) and internal (i.e., boardbased) CEO monitoring. Based on insights from the career-concerns literature, we identify short-horizon CEOs as those nearing retirement, at a firm with a current earnings decline or loss, and/or with an impending job change. We find that firms with a CEO identified as having a short-horizon place greater contract weight on forward-looking information. This horizon-lengthening contract adjustment is less pronounced when there is greater external monitoring (i.e., as proxied by a high level of shareholder rights), consistent with the intuition that increased shareholder rights mitigate CEO entrenchment, leading to less myopic decision making, independent of a contract adjustment. However, we also find that the horizon-lengthening contract adjustment is more pronounced when there is greater internal monitoring (i.e., as proxied by characteristics of the board), consistent with the intuition that increased employment risk from more intense internal monitoring itself creates a demand for increased incentive weights as a means of compensating the CEO for the increased risk.

This study focuses on the role of the corporate board of directors and the relationship between the dynamics of board structure and the financial performance of listed South African companies. The research results found that the proportion of independent non-executive directors had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share and enterprise value, but had no significant effect on Tobin's Q ratio. Board ownership had a significant negative correlation with firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The number of directors serving on the corporate board had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The study suggests that greater independent non-executive director representation, lower board share-ownership and larger board sizes should be encouraged to enhance firm performance.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

This study seeks to trace dimensions through which corporate governance characteristics influence the financial performance of family owned businesses. Between the periods of 2009-2011, we examined 160 Lebanese family owned firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group. Using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance, we found evidence of the attribute of boards' composition to firm's failure; the presence of outside directors seemed to have no role in the financial distress and insider ownership decrease the likelihood of financial distress but CEO duality increases the same probability of family owned firms in Lebanon. Our findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators toward the implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance in one of the pillars of every local economy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study focuses on the impact of institutional quality on the amount of disclosure in IPO firms listing prospectuses using the six well established World Bank Governance indices, namely corruption control, government effectiveness in promotion of private sector development, political stability and absence from terrorism, regulatory quality, rule of law and lastly democratic voice and accountability. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 165 IPO firms from across Africa from 2000 to 2011 I find evidence that enhanced rule of law and regulatory quality impact on the amount of disclosure by firms, reflected in length of IPO listings prospectuses. In addition I find evidence that founder-led entrepreneurial firms are more likely to disclose more alongside firms in extractive and technology industries that rely on local stock exchanges as a source of external finance. In contrast IPO firms that have significant long term foreign partners or are subsidiaries of foreign Multinational Enterprises are likely to disclose less than other types of firm underscoring their apathy to domestic investors and relative lack of dependence on indigenous stock markets as a viable source of external finance.

This paper studies the differential impact on IPO firm listing prospectus length from increasing proportions of foreign directors from civil as opposed to common law societies and social elites. Using a unique hand-collected and comprehensive sample of 165 IPO firms from across 18 African countries the evidence suggests that increasing proportions of directors from civil code law countries is associated with shorter prospectuses while the opposite is true for their common law counterparts. Furthermore increasing proportions of directors drawn from elevated social positions in indigenous society is related to increasing prospectus length in North Africa while being insignificant in SSA.

High quality accounting information is vital for the accuracy of the financial statements, whereas poor quality information may lead to serious economic problems. The recent financial crisis has attracted the interest of many researchers in determining the factors that may affect the quality of accounting information. In this field, our research investigates the possible impact of the ownership structure and of the make-up of the board of directors on the quality of accounting information, using annual data from 29 companies listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange in 2008 and 2009. The actual research starts by presenting an appropriate measure of the quality of the accounting information, then developing a model explaining the relationship between the ownership structure, the board of directors and the quality of the accounting information. In the light of our results, we will be able to provide recommendations for helping the companies improve the quality of their financial reporting.

Using a panel of 504 Taiwanese listed firms during a 10-year period (2002-2011), this study tests whether there is an optimal level of board ownership, which maximizes firm value. This work adopts Tobin's Q as the proxy for firm value and finds that board ownership between 11.57% and 14.35% are an optimal level of board ownership to maximize firm value. This shift in financing sources propels the nonlinear relationship uncovered in this study and sheds light on Taiwan's legal system of ownership structure.

This paper examines the whole role of both board of directors and ownership structure on the effectiveness of executive compensation design in Spanish listed firms. Using a principalprincipal agency framework and based on panel data methodology analysis in the period 2004-2011, results show that high level of ownership concentration influence negatively in the executive compensation alignment, having an adverse effect on minority shareholders' interests. Moreover, evidences show that type of controlling shareholder determines supervisory board effectiveness, which only exert an effective monitoring over executive compensation - increasing variable pay and diminishing fixed salary-, when majority shareholder has not linked to management of the company.

This research examines the impact of corporate governance on the performance of firms in Pakistan. Corporate governance revolves around the basic principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. The term Corporate Governance is used to describe a process, which has been practiced for as long as there have been corporate entities. Corporate governance is critical to improving economic efficiency and growth. It serves as a deterrent to mismanagement and infuses discipline in the decision making process of boards of directors. A number of surveys of investors in Europe and the US show that investors eventually reduce their investments in a company that practices poor governance. This paper argues that, since the monitoring of the compliance of the financial aspect of the Code in Pakistan is being done by more than one institution, companies usually end up following it. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan has not introduced any proper institution to check companies' compliance with the non-financial aspect of the code, and there is no proper tool in place to gauge if the companies are really complying with it. Companies' compliance with the non-financial aspect of the code usually remains on paper only, and the Code of Corporate Governance has no direct effect on companies' performance.

Conference calls have become increasingly common in recent years, yet there is little empirical evidence regarding the effect of conference calls on executive compensation. In this study, we examine the effect of voluntary disclosures on equity incentives. We hypothesize that voluntary disclosures, as measured by conference calls, affect executive compensation contracts. Using a dataset of 6263 firm-year observations from both conference call and non-conference call firms, our results are consistent with the argument that the board of directors substitutes voluntary disclosures for more costly corporate governance mechanisms. Alternatively, in firms where CEOs have less equity incentives, the owners demand more voluntary disclosures. The results of this study should be of great importance to executives and capital market participants internationally, such as investors and analysts, since we provide evidence that conference calls affect incentive based compensation contracts, which were shown in prior studies to be value relevant.

Purpose -Institutional investors are facing increased pressure and threats of legislation from the European Union to abandon passive ownership strategies. This chapter investigates the legal prerequisites for active ownership among institutional investors in two Scandinavian countries to highlight differences in the legal framework that potentially account for apparent dissimilarities in the practice of shareholder activism. Design/methodology/approach -Data on shareholder proposals from Danish and Swedish annual general meetings from 2006 throughout 2010 suggest that institutional investors are approximately a thousand times more active in Sweden than in Denmark. Findings -The comparative study of the legal framework for shareholder activism shows diminutive legal distance in general, however, we find that the shareholder-based nomination committee employed in Sweden constitutes an exception. This is relevant, as such a setup transfers power from the board of directors to the owners. Presumably, this reduces the impact of free-rider and collective action problems, and increases the shareholders' inclination to make proposals, which is also what we find. Moreover, we find other differences in the legal framework that support the transfer of power to the owners. Research implications -We contribute to literature by investigating the importance of local governance mechanisms created by the legal framework -an area where research is scarce. The chapter discusses how two classical theoretical dilemmas -free-rider problems and collective action problems among shareholders -can be reduced by the implementation of local corporate governance elements. Originality/value -The chapter outlines the actual practice of shareholder activism, in terms of proposals, in Denmark and Sweden, and highlights divergent legal elements which theoretically transfer power to the shareholders. Thus, regulators should be aware of the impact by local governance mechanisms, and how shareholders react under different legal prerequistes. Copyright (c) 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Businesses commonly access new markets through joint ventures, and these partnerships may adopt diverse structures of government, among which the Board of Directors often plays a key role. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to observe which characteristics of the Board most affect the success of joint ventures between Spanish and Moroccan SMEs, operating in Morocco. Using a structured questionnaire, we analyse the characteristics of the Board that affect success, as measured by the partners' satisfaction with the performance achieved. The results show that factors influencing overall partners' satisfaction with the joint venture include the existence of external directors, the existence of directors with a significant level of ownership in the partnership, the existence of an audit committee, and the (low) frequency of Board meetings. All these measures can be said to be indicators of the type of control held over the partnership, as a means of ensuring the partners' goals are achieved.

Risk management committees are now required for all U.S. financial institutions that are regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. All U.S. public companies must now report their risk management activities for both Board of Directors and top management in their 10 K annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This paper analyzes one approach to risk management for public companies and their Boards of Directors. Since 2011, Disclosure Insight Inc. has issued risk ratings for over 1500 public companies in US. Its risk rating is based on the number, nature, and timing of 100 risk factors, which are across major categories, such as the SEC investigative activity, auditor issues, capital market events, and corporate governance issues. Our study finds significant positive abnormal risk-adjusted returns for companies with lower risk ratings and these companies also outperform the S&P500. Thus, this paper should be of interest to investors, company executives, and risk management committees, as well as SEC and other regulators. Alternatively, risk management committees in public companies could just establish their own rating systems, based upon their own key factors, as opposed to using the Disclosure Insight Inc. aggregate rating approach for all 100 risk factors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how board compensation and holdings are related to mutual fund expense ratios. Previous studies find that compensation and expense ratios are positively correlated and argue that this relationship is potential evidence of rent sharing, whereby excessively compensated boards fail to negotiate with fund managers for lower shareholder fees. Design/methodology/approach - Using a dataset of US open-end mutual funds, the author examines how geographic-based salary data, director profession, director fund holdings and fund returns might explain the relationship between compensation and fees. Findings - The results provide additional support for potential rent sharing between fund managers and directors and are robust to alternative measures of director compensation, fund sales loads, director holdings and fund returns. Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited by the sample size and the lack of time series data of the hand-collected dataset. Data are collected from 598 funds in the year 2003. Practical implications - These findings suggest that mutual fund expense ratios may be affected by potential agency costs. Social implications - Mutual fund regulatory focus has been predominantly focused on the independence of board chairmen, but this study shows that compensation may also be a significant contributor to fund governance. Originality/value - This study is unique in its recent focus on fund expense ratios and board compensation and examining potential explanations for this relationship.

We assess to what extent Chinese MBOs of listed corporations enable a balance to be achieved in terms of facilitating growth while maintaining the interests of other (minority) shareholders. Using novel, hand-collected data from 19 MBOs of listed corporations in China, we examine to what extent boards of directors are changed to bring in executive and outside directors with the skills to grow as well as restructure a business, and to what extent outside directors become involved in actions to develop the business versus actions relating to fostering the interests of all shareholders. We find little evidence that outside board members have the skills to add value to the MBO firms. Boards appear to focus mainly on related-party transactions with some more limited attention to growth strategies. Outside directors do not seem to openly disagree with incumbent managers on the disclosure of their actions but may express their views and exert pressure behind the scenes.

In developing countries, governance systems are still recent, or practically non-existent (Shleifer & Vishny, 1997). For this reason, the way their boards behave is not yet clear to the firms in these countries. For foreign investors, the lack of governance structures may represent a risk because it jeopardizes the good corporate governance of the enterprises operating in such regions. This study analyzes the involvement of the board of directors in the strategy of enterprises located in developing countries. The study is guided by the question: In developing countries, what is the difference between the board of directors' current level and its ideal level of involvement in company strategy? Based on the theory of the role of the boards of directors, we present the results of a survey with 32 firms from 19 developing countries. The businesses were chosen among those widely known by international investors, including multilateral financing agencies and commercial banks. Respondents were the chairman of the board of directors or, in some cases, a senior manager referred by him. The results presented show that the European boards have the highest degree of involvement in firm strategy. In Asia, the main specific characteristic influencing the board's performance is the high level of government involvement in corporate management. In Latin America, the predominance of family groups with high ownership concentration also emerges, aligned with the fact that this is the region with the second highest degree of board involvement in firm strategy.

Corporate governance issues are especially important in transition economies, since these countries do not have the long-established financial institution infrastructure to deal with corporate governance issues. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no need to discuss corporate governance issues because all enterprises were owned by the state and there were no shareholders. All that has changed since 1989. This paper discusses the view on corporate governance in some transition economies. Highly limited knowledge on executive pay in (post)transition economies creates demand for research in this filed; this paper explores executive compensation structure in Croatia. The research was conducted among Croatian public limited companies during December 2010 through February 2011 at a response rate of 18,44%. Paper also covers specificities of the development of the corporate governance structures and practices in the Republic of Macedonia.

Sustainable reports are the basic tool used to reflect and communicate stakeholder dialogue. Therefore, sustainability reporting has become a key element for strategic management. Companies' strategies are defined and developed by their boards of directors. This study explores the relationship between sustainability reporting and the existence of at least three women on the board of directors. Our results show that in countries with a higher proportion of boards of directors with at least three women, the levels of CSR reporting are higher. We also find that countries with higher gender equality have more companies with boards of directors with at least three women. We control for other variables that affect differences among countries and differences in CSR reporting as found in previous studies: cultural differences, law enforcement, GDP, industry and regulation. Our paper contributes to the literature by studying the relationship between board gender composition and CSR reporting. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of media pressure on external directors in relation to disclosure of information on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a multilevel approach, integrating the institutional, organisational and individual levels of analysis in a whole model that explains corporate transparency. The paper uses a sample composed of 98 non-financial listed Spanish companies for the period 2004-2010, Findings: The results show heterogeneity between external board members. Proprietary directors, representing shareholders, tend to promote adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines in order to increase value for shareholders. On the contrary, independent directors are risk adverse in relation to the effect that CSR information disclosure could have on their professional reputations. Research limitations/implications: The sample could be improved, including companies from different countries and more years for the analysis, since the period studied comprises a particular economic setting (2008-2010), a global financial crisis. Practical implications: Although these results from the Spanish context, the authors recommend that regulatory bodies incorporate provisions into good governance codes that guarantee the existence of quality and comparable CSR information that favours stakeholders' decision taking. Originality/value: The image that society has about a company comes from the opinions created from the mass media. The arguments proposed by agenda-setting theory can be managed by companies as a strategic mechanism to respond to society expectations. At present, two of the most studied aspects are the ethical and sustainable behaviours of organisations. These aspects are related to the characteristics of boards of directors, especially to external directors. Independent directors may disagree with disclosing information about CSR practices because they fear that this information would affect their professional reputations, since they are not specialised in these topics. However, proprietary directors favour the disclosure of this information in an attempt to reduce the cost of capital and risk perceived by investors, especially in more sustainable companies.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We combine the value-creation and value-protection views of the board of directors to study the impact of board independence (BI) on the value of the firm at the time of its initial public offering (IPO). Research Findings/Insights: We conduct our analysis on a sample of 969 firms that went public in France, Germany, and Italy between 1995 and 2011. We show that BI is a critical factor in the valuation of IPO firms. Our results support both the value-creation and value-protection roles of the board of directors. The relative importance of the two roles of the board varies over time, with value-creation (value-protection) dominating in IPOs of young (mature) companies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our theoretical framework combines the agency and resource-dependence theories. The impact of BI on IPO valuation depends on the importance of the value-creation and value-protection roles played by the board. The change in the relative importance of the two roles determines a U-shaped relationship between BI and firm age. Corporate governance is particularly important for young and innovative firms (where the resource-dependence theory applies, and governance acts as a value-creation device), as well as for mature firms and for companies where ownership and control are separated (where the agency theory applies, and governance serves as a value-protection mechanism for minority shareholders). Practitioner/Policy Implications: We show that corporate governance is a significant factor affecting the valuation of an IPO company. The importance of BI varies substantially with the knowledge intensity of the industry, the separation between ownership and control, and the age of the listing company.

This study examines the effects of ultimate control and the political connections of top executives on firm's performance and the monitoring role played by boards of directors. It investigates whether the political influence of ownership and that of management are complements or substitutes in their effects on board independence and accounting performance. The findings indicate that the state holding in SOEs (state-owned enterprises) weakens board independence, but improves accounting performance. The positive effect of a board chair's political connections on firm-level performance is only documented in SOEs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Business ethics is one of the most significant demands made by institutional and individual investors, who usually require the participation of the board of directors in the planning and implementation of ethical behaviour in corporations. This is done by drawing up an ethics code (EC) and then monitoring its fulfilment. This study has a dual objective: first, to analyse the role played by the composition of the board of directors, and by that we mean its independence and the diversity of its members, on the implementation and scope of an EC, and, second, to detect whether the corporate governance (CG) system moderates the level of involvement of the board in ethical issues. The findings obtained from a data panel sample made up of 760 listed companies from 12 countries for the years 2003-2009 show that the largest companies with large-sized and diverse boards implement the most developed ECs. Nevertheless, the extent of involvement of the independent directors is conditioned by the level of shareholder orientation characteristic of the system of CG in the corporation's country of origin.

This study investigates the impact of the 2002 Chinese Code of Corporate Governance for Listed Companies on earnings manipulations. We find that, in general, the 2002 CODE had a positive effect on curbing earnings management through the introduction of independent non-executive directors to the board of directors and the audit committee, and accounting/financial experts to the audit committee. Although such an impact was minimal when the firms were state-controlled, it became significant once they were privately controlled. Overall, we find regulatory reform on corporate governance plays an important role in deterring the use of earnings management. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines how the presence of representatives of institutional investors as directors on boards or on audit committees enhances financial reporting quality, reducing the probability that the firm receives qualified audit reports. We focus on directors who maintain business relations with the firm on whose board or committee they sit (pressure-sensitive directors). We also investigate the specific role of bank directors and examine their effects on financial reporting quality when they act as shareholders and directors. Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that institutional directors are effective monitors, which leads to higher quality financial reporting and, therefore, a lower likelihood that the firm receives a qualified audit report. Consistent with the relevant role of business relations with the firm, we find that directors appointed to both boards and audit committees by pressure-sensitive investors have a larger effect on financial reporting quality as it is more likely that the auditor issues an unqualified audit opinion. Nevertheless, when analyzed separately, only savings bank representatives on the board increase financial reporting quality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results confirm that board characteristics have an important influence on financial reporting quality, in line with the views that have been expressed by several international bodies. The findings also suggest that both researchers and policy makers should no longer consider institutional investors as a whole, given than directors appointed by different types of institutional investors have various implications on financial reporting quality, measured by the type of audit opinion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study makes its core contribution by empirically showing that directors appointed by different types of institutional investors have diverse implications on financial reporting quality. This evidence can be potentially helpful in providing a basis for regulatory actions, namely those aiming to influence the structure of the board of directors. The results have important implications for supervisors and regulators, who will benefit from an understanding of how the presence of directors on boards of savings and commercial banks in nonfinancial firms affects financial reporting quality in a bank-based system.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the current governance practices and governance structure of Islamic banks (IBs) in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Southeast Asia countries with the purpose of providing relevant information in guiding the future development of the governance system for IBs. As well, the paper discusses and compares the state of the governance system in GCC countries (Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) and Southeast Asia countries (Malaysia and Indonesia). Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes descriptive analysis approach in extracting and analyzing data collected for 83 IBs observed for the period 2002-2011. The authors test for differences in means and medians of corporate governance attributes between a sample of IBs in GCC countries and another one for Southeast Asia countries. They use selected variables of corporate governance of different governance structures, namely, the ownership structure, the board of directors, the Shariah board and the CEO attributes. Findings - The paper findings argue that there are significant differences and divergence of corporate governance structure of IBs in GCC countries and those in Southeast Asia countries. This position acknowledges that there are shortcomings to the existing governance framework for IBs which needs further improvement and standardization. Practical implications - The paper is a very useful source of information that may provide relevant guidelines in guiding the future development of corporate governance of IBs. As well, the paper provides relevant guidelines for improving regulations and laws covering the governance of IBs. Originality/value - This paper provides fresh data and recent information on the actual corporate governance system in IBs in GCC and Southeast Asia countries. As well, the paper discusses a significant shortage in corporate governance literature of Islamic finance. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effects of the separation of control and ownership on the value of cash holdings in publicly listed French firms. It also sheds light on the role of board independence in such a relation. Theory suggests that investors are more likely to discount the value of excess cash held by firms with low corporate governance. Using the valuation regression of Fama and French (1998), empirical results show that the value of excess cash holdings decreases dramatically with the separation of control and cash-flow rights of the controlling shareholder. This value discount is, however, less pronounced in firms with more independent boards (i.e., boards with more independent directors and separate chief executive officer and chair positions). Our empirical findings support the argument that excess cash contributes less to firm value when minority shareholders are more likely to be expropriated by controlling shareholders. Independent boards seem to be effective in mitigating investors' concerns about the use of excess cash. Overall, the results provide compelling evidence that cash valuation is largely influenced by corporate governance quality in a concentrated ownership setting. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

We examine board structure in France, which since 1966 has allowed firms the freedom to choose between unitary and two-tier boards. We analyze how this choice relates to characteristics of the firm and its environment. Firms with severe asymmetric information tend to opt for unitary boards; firms with a potential for private benefits extraction tend to adopt two-tier boards. Chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to performance at firms with two-tier boards, indicating greater monitoring. Our results are broadly consistent with the Adams and Ferreira (2007) model and suggest that gains result from allowing freedom of contract about board structure. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study documents a positive relationship between audit committee stock ownership and firm performance in large US firms from 1998 to 2008. This study also finds a positive relationship between changes in ownership and performance. These results persist throughout the sample period, do not weaken after Sarbanes-Oxley and are robust to controlling for endogeneity between ownership and performance. After testing shows that there is no relationship between audit committee independence and firm performance, these findings suggest that audit committee stock ownership is an important corporate governance mechanism and potentially a more relevant variable than audit committee independence from a policy perspective.

This article observes separately and jointly the impact of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and/or board of directors' independence on accounting conservatism in FTSE 100 nonfinancial firms between 2002 and 2007. Using Givoly and Hayn's (2000) accrual-based measure of accounting conservatism, we found a reduction in conservatism after the mandatory adoption of IFRS, and, also, that board of directors' independence improved accounting conservatism. Moreover, IFRS and board of directors' independence had a complementary impact on accounting conservatism since the role of independent directors was not observable prior to the mandatory adoption of IFRS. Our results suggest that, after the mandatory adoption of IFRS, independent directors are likely to put significantly more pressure on the management to practice more accounting conservatism.

Purpose: Under IAS 24 a related party transaction (RPT) is a "transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged" (IASB). The purpose of this paper is to consider the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the parent company for the interpretation of the RPT. Considering the interest of the group means to interpret the intra-group transactions not as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on explanatory multiple case studies in order to answer the following research questions: why the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the subsidiaries by the parent company are important in the interpretation of RPTs. How RPTs can be interpreted in the light of the directing activity of the holding company. Findings: Dominant shareholder tends to demonstrate that the group it is not managed as a single economic entity and sometimes that subsidiaries are not really controlled. The case studies show that a regulation that imposes the transparency of the directing activity has at least two effects: the controlling shareholder finds it convenient to delegate the decision-making power and to not carry out RPTs among firms that do not present clear economic links. Thus, the transparency of the directing activity seems to be a disincentive to the establishment of a pyramidal group with expropriation purposes. Research limitations/implications: It is appropriate that the interpretation of the RPT take into account not only the disclosure of the RPT (e.g. type and nature), but also the following disclosure: the reason and the business purpose that lead to RPT; the interest of the company in engaging such transactions; and the procedures for their approval. The independence of subsidiaries directors is necessary to ensure the management autonomy of the boards, and in the case of directing activity they have to protect outsiders in the case of detrimental transactions ordered by the controlling and directing company that are not carried out in the interest of the group. Originality/value: Unlike what has been done so far by the literature on RPT, this paper considers the interest of the group to interpret the intra-group transactions and the separation between control and direction. It means do not interpret RPT as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We study the stock market's reaction to the unexpected death of a top executive or board chair for insight into grey director incentives. Whereas there is little debate as to the motives of inside and strict outside directors, the allegiance of grey directors is less certain. We find that grey directors' dominant incentive depends on whether the firm has a succession plan or not. In firms with a succession plan, grey directors' primary motive is to maintain their business ties to the firm. Absent a succession plan, the stock market expects grey directors to use their influence to hire a higher quality replacement, particularly when these directors hold a large equity stake. Our findings suggest that grey directors place their interests as shareholders first when a replacement decision is likely to weaken their business ties with the firm. Grey directors appear to influence the choice of a higher quality replacement whether that person is an insider or outsider. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using earnings announcement events made by group member firms in Hong Kong, this study examines the governance role of boards of directors in curbing propping activities within family business groups. We find that earnings released by group member firms affect the stock prices of their nonannouncing group peers in a manner consistent with intragroup propping. More importantly, this effect is less pronounced when the announcing firms have a larger board or a board with a higher proportion of independent directors, but more pronounced when they have an executive director from their controlling families acting as board chairperson. Furthermore, the monitoring effect of boards of directors is strengthened for firms subject to new regulations increasing board power. Our results suggest that board oversight can mitigate propping activities. (c) 2014 Financial Management Association International.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Purpose: This exploratory study aims to provide preliminary evidence regarding the non-audit committee corporate governance determinants of audit committee functionality. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on archival accounting, corporate governance data, and interviews of subjects of the top 100 companies listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX100). A logistic regression is used to identify the non-audit committee governance attributes that affect the likelihood of of having a functional audit committee. Findings: Board size and board independence, (CEO-chairman duality) are positively (negatively) related to audit committee functionality, suggesting complementary governance relations. On the other hand, the authors document a negative relation between auditor type (Big4) and audit committee functionality indicating a substitutive governance effect. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the actual functioning of audit committees in Egypt beyond mere regulatory requirements. The study highlights the importance of assuring that the "spirit" of corporate governance laws and regulations is adhered to rather than the mere compliance with their "letter".

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the perceptions of accountants on corporate governance (CG) practices in public limited liability companies in Barbados, and the perceived effectiveness of these mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage approach was utilized. First, an Internet-based questionnaire was sent to members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Barbados to gain accounting perspectives on CG practices by listed Barbadian companies. Second, feedback on the survey results was obtained from the attendees of a panel session at a regional accounting conference. Third, interviews were conducted with five qualified accountants tofurther explore issues that emerged from the previous stages. Findings - The results suggest that the most important mechanisms for effective CG were the board of directors, auditors and professional accountants. The timely provision of relevant information, board room culture, qualifications and independence of directors were the tasks considered most vital to enhancing board effectiveness. However, the high concentration of ownership in family-controlled frms, interlocking directorates, weak regulatory systems and cultural issues influenced the effectiveness of CG mechanisms. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers and improving CG included purposive training, whistle-blowing mechanisms, stronger legislation and adequate disclosures. Research limitations/implications - The study's small sample increases the likelihood of bias and important differences being missed, thus reducing the generalizability to the accounting profession as a whole. Practical implications - The research sheds light on the value being placed on CG practices by the accounting profession. The study would assist companies, board of directors and accounting practitioners in developing CG mechanisms that are suitable for emerging countries. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the dearth of literature on perceptions of accountants on CG practices in emerging economies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2049-372X.

Nowadays, separation of ownership from control in business causes the inability of shareholders to have a full control over managerial actions. In this situation, agency theory assumes an opportunistic behavior, that is, individuals want to maximize their own expected interests and are resourceful in doing so. This opportunistic behavior leads to conflict of interest betweenmanagers and shareholders on the one hand, and majority andminority shareholders on the other. From the agency theory perspective, the aim of Corporate Governance (CG) is to mitigate these agency conflicts and direct the operations to achieve an appropriate performance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between CG characteristics and firm performance in Malaysian listed firms where divergence between cash flow and control rights is critical. Based on a randomly selected sample of 400 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia and applying the linear multiple regression, it is found that board independency and CEO duality have respectively positive and negative relationship with firm performance. In addition, audit quality has a significantly positive relationship with firm performance. The contribution of this study is to add a dummy interaction between audit quality and divergence between cash flow and control rights. It is found that high-quality audit firms can mitigate the agency problems in firms with divergence between cash flow and control rights. (c) 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper sets the background to the Special Issue of the Journal of Empirical Finance on Challenges of Corporate Governance. It identifies the alternative approaches that can be taken to solve agency problems stemming from asymmetries of information: (i) ex-post monitoring through audit and information provision, (ii) ex-ante monitoring through boards, and (iii) incentivisation through the alignment of managerial incentives with shareholders. It discusses how the UK and the US have responded to corporate failures and relates the development of regulation in these countries to the three alternative approaches. It concludes with a discussion of three groups of challenges: (i) understanding alternative regulatory approaches, (ii) determining the importance of geo-diversity of business culture, and (iii) overcoming the problems of the political economy of corporate governance.

Purpose - This study aims to investigate the nature and extent of compliance to the principle-based corporate governance initiatives by the listed companies in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji. Three important questions are addressed: whether listed companies in Fiji have complied with the principle-based governance practices? Did compliance with principle-based recommendations lead to an improvement in the listed company's financial performance and legitimacy? How the institutional factors have contributed towards corporate governance practices in Fiji? Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the SPSE companies over the period 2008-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that listed companies have adopted the Capital Market Development Authority's (CMDA) recommendations by establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, having non-executive/independent directors on the board and separate chair and CEO positions in order to gain legitimacy from stakeholders. Results support the view that the CMDA recommendations of board sub-committees (audit and remuneration) have had positive influence on company performance measured by Tobin's Q. The findings of this study give support to the principle-based corporate governance practices adopted in Fiji to gain legitimacy. Originality/value - The study adds to the governance literature by focusing on the principle-based governance practices in a small remote island country, Fiji which has relatively small economy, capital market and company size. Finally, the study adds to institutional theory by showing how companies' corporate governance choices are affected by the severity of agency conflicts and the way corporate governance is regulated.

The objective of this paper is to examine the influence of board of directors on market performance of large Malaysian listed companies. Using data from corporate annual reports for the financial year 2010, the regression results show that the proportion of independent directors on the board and the proportion of government ownership have a positive and significant impact, while role duality has a marginally significant impact on market capitalisation. These findings suggest that the market values companies which have a higher proportion of independent directors and government ownership. In contrast, the marginally significant finding on role duality implies that in Malaysia where businesses are predominantly built from family businesses, separating the chairman and CEO roles may not enhance market performance. The findings of this study show that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance instead it should be applied taking into consideration a company's nuances and needs.

This study investigates corporate governance in Kuwait from stakeholders' perspective by examining different stakeholder groups' perceptions. The study presents the concept of corporate governance, the current situation, the corporate governance mechanisms, and the impact of legal system and accountability on Kuwait's corporate governance. The study applied semi-structured interviews with several stakeholder groups; grounded theory procedures are also adopted to interpret the results. The findings suggest that the corporate governance concept is well known, yet current laws are irrelevant; several obstacles need to be addressed to implement corporate governance in Kuwait. According to interviewees, board committees are important in Kuwait, and boards of directors and dividends are dominated by major shareholders. Moreover, some corporate governance mechanisms are not well organized in Kuwait. For example, ownership structures produce problems for listed companies, banks have limited roles, and companies have appointed ineffective independent directors, while the legal system, shareholders' and stakeholders' rights, and shareholders' protections are very weak. In addition, accountability is not clearly identified in Kuwaiti rules. (c) 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Using a sample of 40 French companies listed on the SBF 120 for the period 2002-2009, we examine if board structure (board size, independence of its members and the cumulative functions of decision and control) relate to their performance. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board structure and financial performance measured by four different ratios, namely ROA, ROE, Tobin's Q and Market to Book, we have developed four dynamic panel system GMM approach to control for relevant sources of endogeneity (simultaneity, reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity). Our results support the idea, commonly accepted, that board structure is a determinant factor for French firm performance. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of higher-quality auditors on corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory suggests that managers have incentives to avoid risk in the interests of perquisite consumption and self-preservation, while investors prefer that managers invest in all projects with a positive net present value, i.e. projects that generally increase corporate risk. Empirical literature finds that managerial risk-aversion is mitigated (and firm value enhanced) when investor protection is higher. The authors examine whether higher-quality auditing is one such mechanism to encourage shareholder-focused corporate risk-taking. They model measures of corporate risk as a function of whether a firm is audited by an industry specialist or not, controlling specifically for accounting quality. They then examine the incremental effect of higher-quality audits on other forms of external monitoring (analyst coverage and institutional holdings) for corporate risk. Findings - Using a sample from 2003 to 2007, the authors document a positive relationship between local-level audit industry specialization and both the standard deviation of annual stock returns and research and development expenditures (their measures of corporate risk-taking). They then find the effect is mitigated when firms have alternative external monitoring, in the form of either higher analyst coverage or greater institutional holdings. Research limitations/implications - Given the nature of the question the authors ask, particularly in the context of the auditor- client relationship, a potential limitation is the difficulty in assigning causation. Nonetheless, this study underscores the importance of auditors as an effective mechanism for monitoring corporate managers. Originality/value - This study provides novel evidence that auditors affect managerial decision making beyond a simple effect on financial statements, and should be of interest to boards of directors, regulators and investors.

This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

This study investigates how mandatory adoption of the new accounting standards and enforcement mechanisms such as Big 4 auditors and board independence influence earnings management. Based on a sample of 120 firms listed on the French stock exchange, we find that the mandatory adoption of IFRS does not affect managerial opportunism. In contrast with previous studies, our results show that the corporate governance mechanisms are not sufficiently strong to enforce the application of the IFRS standards in France. This can be due to the special characteristics of the French context known by the weak investors' protection rights even in the post-IFRS period. IFRS can be of high quality just if they are accompanied with some factors like efficient governance mechanisms and appropriate enforcement. Copyright (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

Given the worldwide economic importance of bank loan financing, we empirically investigate the roles of borrowers' ownership and board structure in bank loan terms through a comprehensive dataset, which includes the complete history of individual bank loan contracts for firms publicly listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). We find that firms with smaller deviation in shareholder voting and cash flow rights, larger non-retail shareholding, fewer shares pledged by the board of directors, independent directors, and firms without dual boards are more likely to borrow from banks at lower spread. In addition, good governance practices are also associated with larger loan size or longer loan period, suggesting that banks take into account borrowers' governance practices when designing loan contracts. This fact is consistent with the agency cost and information risk explanations of Bhojraj and Sengupta (2003). Furthermore, this study uncovers that the beneficial effect of good governance practices on bank loan contracting is more pronounced in borrowers with high leverage and poor rating, which implies that the monitoring role of governance is more crucial in risky firms. Our findings are robust to the various characteristics of firms and loans. (c) 2014 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

This paper examines whether the audit quality of Chinese listed companies is affected by internal governance mechanisms (IGMs). The dataset comprises 443 firm-year observations during 2002-2005. The results show that foreign ownership concentration and the number of professional supervisors are positively related to audit quality, but the size of the supervisory board shows a negative correlation. Other IGMs including state ownership concentration, the size of board of directors, the number of independent directors, the frequency of board meetings, and the frequency of supervisory board meetings are found to have no impact on audit quality. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, according to Young et al. (2008), this paper develops hypotheses from the principal-principal agency problem perspective and examines the impact of IGMs of China's highly concentrated state ownership and two-tier board system on audit quality. Second, this paper employs the directors on the board of directors and the supervisory board as pairwise functional units and examines whether there is a level of functional redundancy proposed by Ding et al. (2010). Third, this paper adds to the extant literature by showing the relevance of the legal environment as one of external governance mechanisms. Copyright (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Earnings management has attracted much attention in this globalised economic environment due to large accounting scandals such as Enron and WorldCom. National governments and other market-regulation institutions are taking measures to restrain earnings management in order to ensure the reliability and transparency of financial reporting. This study explores whether audit committees and boards of directors influence earnings management using the literary review method. The findings show that both discretionary accruals and abnormal accruals are mostly used as dependent variables to detect earnings manipulation estimated by the Jones and modified Jones models. For the most part, evidence from previous literature indicates that the more independent the members of the audit committee and board, the higher the quality of earnings in financial reporting. However, some opposite findings exist. (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper aims outspreading preexisting researches by assessing practically and empirically how board characteristics play a vibrant role in magnitude of earning management (EM) for the Jordanian listed companies. In particular, the paper throws its light on the principle features of the board of directors, i.e. board independence, CEO duality, financial expertise, governance expertise, firm-specific expertise and size. In this paper, a cross-sectional version of the Modified Jones Model is applied to ensure the accurate assessment of the key impacts of board characteristics on EM for a sample of 86 industrial listed companies on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the years 2008 to 2010. Discretionary accruals are used as proxy for EM. This study, on the basis of findings, reveals the significant correlation between salient board features and EM. Findings of this systematic observation demonstrate that board independence, financial expertise, governance expertise and size have a negative relation with EM. It also found that CEO duality and board firm-specific expertise have an obvious positive relation with discretionary accruals. The findings suggested that the board character has an effective role in detecting EM and in turn improve financial reporting quality (FRQ). In real fields, the discoveries of this paper portray valuable information for the regulators in different countries. The results also provide useful information for investors in assessing the impact of board characteristics on FRQ. In fact, previous studies on this very issue in this context do not meet the demand of comprehensive observation appropriately. To make input in this area, particularly among Jordanian companies, this study will extend the scope through providing empirically tested findings of the role of board directors' characteristics on EM. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and EM in Jordan.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

This paper examines the effectiveness of six institutional quality measures, namely corruption control, effective government, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability, in inhibiting self-rewarding behaviour of boards in terms of their compensation as well as in influencing the likelihood of disclosure of individual executive salaries in IPO listings prospectuses. Using a unique and comprehensive dataset of 78 hand-collected IPO firms from across North Africa from 2000 to 2012 I find substantial evidence that government effectiveness and corruption control are important in inhibiting director self-reward and expropriation while political stability is more associated with increased likelihood of transparency in reporting of salaries. In addition firms from poor informational environments are more likely to initiate enhanced self-governance and transparency so as to overcome institutional deficiencies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the monitoring effectiveness of insider-dominated boards and outsider-dominated boards on different types of CEOs. Design/methodology/approach - To test whether boards monitor inside CEOs and outside CEOs differently and to compare the sizes of the effects across board types, the paper relates CEO resignations to performance measure. The paper tests the hypotheses using logit models to estimate the probability of a CEO change. Findings - It is widely believed that only an outsider-dominated board can provide effective management oversight. The paper finds evidence supporting this view after categorized CEOs based on their affiliation with their firms upon hire. However, the paper also documents that after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), an insider-dominated board is just as effective as an outsider board in monitoring if the CEO was initially hired from outside of the firm. This suggests that there is no difference between insider and outsider board monitoring of outside CEOs. Therefore, after SOX, as far as board monitoring is concerned, what matters is the independence between the CEO and the firm rather than the board structure itself. Research limitations/implications - If effective board monitoring is the reason of the revised listing standards approved by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2003 to require companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq to have a board that is composed of a majority of independent (or outsider) directors, the paper has provided more flexibility and choices to the listed firms. For example, firms that will be better off with insider boards can choose to hire outside CEOs because monitoring effects on outside CEOs are the same regardless of board types after SOX. Originality/value - The results of this paper have interesting implication. First, the paper has shown that an outsider-dominated board is still a better monitor even after categorized CEOs based on their affiliation with their firms upon hire. Second, if effective board monitoring is the reason of the revised listing standards approved by SEC in 2003 to require companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq to have a board that is composed of a majority of independent (or outsider) directors, the paper has provided more flexibility and choices to the listed firms. For example, firms that will be better off with insider boards can choose to hire outside CEOs because monitoring effects on outside CEOs are the same regardless of board types after SOX.

Previous literature suggests that classified boards of directors could impact firm performance in the context of firm-specific characteristics. In continuation of this discussion, this study investigates the effect of classified boards on firm value in the restaurant industry. Even though classified boards can reduce firm value because of higher monitoring costs, existing literature argues that classified boards are devoted to protecting investors and shareholders against opportunistic bids, which in turn increases their debt financing capabilities. Data from U.S. restaurant firms was analyzed by Compustat and RiskMetrics from 2007-2011 to investigate whether classified boards impact firm value in the restaurant industry. Our results indicate that classified boards of directors lower the value destruction of restaurant firms in terms of cost of debt. That is, cost of debt is lower in classified board firms, thereby reducing their negative impact on firm value. The implications and limitation of this research are also discussed.

This study uses the London Stock Exchange (LSE), forced to demutualize due to major changes in its business environment, notably due to increased competition and technological advances, as field experiment to study corporate governance restructuring to adapt to new market conditions. The LSE improved its financial situation after demutualization and is an example of successful corporate governance restructuring. The LSE significantly restructured the composition of its board of directors following demutualization. The number of exchange members on the LSE board decreased after demutualization while the number of independent directors increased, pointing to a more "monitoring board", in support of an agency theory approach. Interestingly, the large majority of these independent directors had experiences in diverse business. The LSE significantly reorganized its management team to adapt to the new strategies triggered by demutualization and modified its compensation by increasing performance-related payments. Results suggest that demutualization brings efficiencies if accompanied by changes in the governing bodies and in the incentive structures of the exchanges. Most of our results could be relevant also, for example, for firms going public, for smaller firms that are expanding their activities and searching for outside investors and for companies facing major changes in their business environments.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the cognitive as well as the disciplinary role of one important governance mechanism that is the board of directors in a privatization context. Using a sample of privatized French companies, we examine the relationship between the size, component and structure of this mechanism to the performance and value creation on the post privatization period. Thus, the majority of our findings have support on the theory of cognitive governance, one aspect of governance that was ignored in previous research.

This chapter considers the institutional environment in Russia, its potential impact upon governance practices, and the attitudes of Russian executives towards the alignment of governance processes relative to international standards. Focusing on corporate board directorship, the research addresses the extent that the harmonization of governance to international standards may assist boards of directors to improve their corporate development. Using a survey questionnaire, the authors explore perceptions of directors of public companies concerning the challenges of corporate governance development in the country. The study illustrates unanimity among the respondents about the reforms needed for international convergence of corporate governance standards. The results reveal that institutional alignment with good governance principles will foster strategic corporate development in the Russian economy. The study offers insights to policymakers in terms of enhancing legitimacy of corporate governance in the Russian context and provides a perspective for executives of foreign companies considering investment in the country.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Because CEO turnover events provide the board of directors with a unique opportunity to potentially completely restructure CEO compensation packages, changes to CEO compensation following a turnover event could prove to inform the ongoing debate regarding CEO compensation. This paper investigates what happens to CEO compensation when a turnover event occurs. Specifically, I examine CEO compensation levels and pay-performance sensitivity for incoming and outgoing CEOs involved in turnover events at public companies in the United States. My main findings are as follows: (1) incoming CEOs are paid as much as or more than those they replace, (2) outsider replacements are paid more than their predecessors even after controlling for education and skills, and (3) CEOs who are forced out are not paid differently from those who replace them, while CEOs who leave voluntarily are paid significantly less than their replacements. Further analysis reveals that proxies for managerial power including CEO tenure, CEO centrality, founder status, and high CEO ownership cannot explain these results. Overall, these findings are difficult to reconcile with the view that managerial power is the primary determinant of CEO compensation.

This study investigates the relationship between two governance issues, i.e., ownership and board structure of Malaysian listed firms (between 2010 and 2012) and their performance in terms of profitability, liquidity and gearing. Structural Equation Modeling is applied and the data analysis tool used is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The dependent variables used as proxies for financial performance are; profitability, liquidity and gearing, whilst the independent variables are; ownership retention (OR), board size (BS), percentage of executive directors (ED), percentage of independent directors (ID) and percentage of non-independent non-executive directors (NINED). It is conjectured that there is consistency across all components of ownership and board structure in terms of its relationship with the gearing of companies. With the exception of non-independent non-executive directors, all other components of board structure in this study seem to have an impact on the gearing of companies. In that respect, it can be concluded that a company's ownership structure and board of directors who represent the shareholders have major concerns on the gearing of companies compared to other financial indicators, as the level of gearing of a company has important and long-lasting effects on the profitability and liquidity of companies. This study leads the path for further research on all aspects of a company's gearing. (c) the author(s).

Research into the impact of government ownership on the financial performance of listed companies typically assumes the government to be a monolithic entity and fails to consider that government ownership rights are administered by different types of government organizations. Exploring the financial performance of government controlled listed companies we find that in Malaysia the impact of government ownership varies depending on the type of organization which manages the government's ownership stakes. Taking into account golden Share provisions as well as the presence of senior civil servants and of politicians on boards of Directors, we find that firms controlled by investment organizations under federal government control tend to outperform firms controlled by regional governments' investment organizations.

Co-operatives are defined by the International Co-operative Alliance as 'an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise'. Under the name co-operative, very different organisations coexist: consumer co-operatives, worker co-operatives, producers' co-operatives, co-operative banks, etc. However, in spite of different contexts and businesses, co-operatives share the same principles. Their goal is triple: to defend their values; to ensure the sustainability of the organisation in a long term approach; and to ensure an equitable distribution of profits. Being a co-operative involves answering requirements such as implementing a democratic management and defining terms of membership, but also appointing a board of directors that will represent members and defend their interests in a simultaneously individual and collective perspective. Few studies exist on the specific components of the role of directors in co-operative organisations and none explores the best practices of cooperative boards that could provide lessons for other kinds of organisation. The board of directors is a key player in governance. The role of the board is to monitor management (Baysinger and Hoskisson 1990; Jensen and Zajac 2004) and to provide guidance for strategy and decision-making (Walsh and Seward 1990; Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Golden and Zajac 2001).

This paper's objective is to study the issue of employee ownership in the context of corporate governance. We show first that the literature is controversial on the role that employees shareholders may play in the corporate governance system and consequently in value creation. In a second step, we empirically analyse the performance of a sample of companies from the index SBF 250. Our results show a negative relationship between the presence of employee shareholders in the control bodies (board of director or board of trustees) and financial performance indicators.

This paper selects 204 companies listed in Shenzhen SME board from 2009 to 2011 as the research objects, empirically analyses the relationship between SME board listed companies' corporate governance structure and R&D investment. The regression results show that ownership concentration is not beneficial to SMEs' R&D investment, and a certain extent of outside blockholders has a positive effect on R&D investment. There is no significant correlation between the appropriate proportion of independent directors and R&D investment, but the board director holding a CEO concurrently in listed SMEs has positive impact on R&D investment. There exists a significant positive correlation between the board of directors and manager shareholding and the investment in R&D, the board of supervisors' shareholding has a negative effect to R&D investment, however, there is no statistical significance.

The European Commission has recently proposed the introduction of legally binding quotas for women on corporate boards of European companies. This proposal has put the spotlight on the question of whether increasing female representation on the board brings economic benefits to the firm. In order to shed light on the issue, this study investigates the direct and indirect effects of women on the board on firm value. We use a simultaneous equation model to estimate the effects of women on the board on firm value, financial performance, and compliance with ethical and social principles adopted by the firm. We find no evidence that a higher female representation on the board directly affects firm's value. However, we find indirect effects. Women on the board are positively related with financial performance (measured in terms of return on assets and return on sales) and with ethical and social compliance, which in turn are positively related with firm value. The findings in this study suggest that greater female representation on corporate boards of large European firms can increase firm value indirectly. Further, part of the indirect effect comes from stronger compliance with ethical principles, something that is not captured by accounting-based financial performance.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - This paper aims to empirically examine the quality of corporate governance (CG) practices in Egyptian-listed companies and their impact on firm performance and financial distress in the context of an emerging market such as that of Egypt. Design/methodology/approach - To assess the level of CG practices at a given firm, the current study constructs a corporate governance index (CGI) which consists of four dimensions: disclosure and transparency, composition of the board of directors, shareholders' rights and investor relations and ownership and control structure. Based on a sample of 86 non-financial firms listed on the Egyptian Exchange, the effects of CG on performance and financial distress are assessed. Tobin's Q is used to assess corporate performance. At the same time, the Altman Z-score is used as a financial distress indicator, as it measures financial distress inversely. The bigger the Z-score, the smaller the risk of financial distress. Findings - The overall score of the CGI, on average, suggests that the quality of CG practices within Egyptian-listed firms is relatively low. The results do not support the positive association between CG practices and financial performance. In addition, there is an insignificant negative relationship between CG practices and the likelihood of financial distress. The current study also provides evidence that firm-specific characteristics could be useful as a first-pass screen in determining firm performance and the likelihood of financial distress. Research limitations/implications - The sample size and time frame of our analysis are relatively small; some caution would be needed before generalizing the results to the entire population. Practical implications - The findings may be of interest to those academic researchers, practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering the quality of CG practices in a developing market such as that of Egypt and its impact on financial performance and financial distress. Originality/value - This paper extends the existing literature, in the Egyptian context in particular, by examining firm performance and the risk of financial distress in relation to the level of CG mechanisms adopted.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper sets out to shed light on female representation on Italian corporate boards before the introduction of gender quota legislation in 2012, as well as on the relevance of family connections. We investigate the potential determinants of having boards with diverse representation and the correlation between female directorship and family connections, with a focus on governance measures. Research Findings: Using data on all directors of Italian publicly traded companies from 2008 to 2010, we identify two different models. In the majority of gender-diverse boards, at least one woman has a family connection to the controlling shareholder. Family-affiliated women are more common in companies that are small, have a concentrated ownership, are in the consumer sector, and have a larger board. Conversely, non-family-affiliated women are more common on the boards of companies that are widely held, have younger and more educated boards, have a higher proportion of independent directors, and have a smaller number of interlocked directors. With reference to governance-related outcomes, the number of board meetings appears to be negatively correlated to both the presence of family members and female directors. Additionally, women show lower attendance than men at board meetings. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper provides support for theories on the differences between the governance of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. Practitioner/Policy Implication: The study offers insights to policymakers implementing gender quota legislation. Substantial effort should be devoted to ensuring that board diversity is associated with actual independence of board members. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

In the last few decades, interest in family firms has increased. There are several analyses in relation to leadership, ownership and succession-related topics, but they omit issues related to stakeholders and corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study broadens empirical evidence in this respect. Using a sample composed of internationally listed companies for the period 2003-2009, we analyse CSR information disclosures in family businesses, as well as the fundamental role of the independence of the board in this regard. Our results show that, in general, the higher the proportion of independent directors, the higher the level of CSR information disclosures; but, in the concrete case of family firms, the "independence" of these directors disappeared, thereby reducing the positive association with information disclosure; this was because independent directors may be strongly influenced by family owners, and even by personal or familiar ties.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

We examine the association between "busyness" of the board of directors (serving on multiple boards) and bank holding company (BHC) performance and risk. We estimate several simultaneous-equations models employing the 3SLS technique and instrumental variables to account for endogeneity. We obtain four main results. First, BHC performance measures (return on equity, Tobin's Q and EBIT over total assets) are positively associated with busyness of directors. Second, BHC risk measures (total, market, idiosyncratic, credit and default risks) are inversely related to busyness of directors. Third, performance (risk) benefits of having busy directors strengthened (weakened) during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Fourth, busy directors are not more likely to become problem directors (fail the 75% attendance standard), and if sitting on boards of both BHC and non-financial firms, they attend more of the BHC board meetings, than those of the non-financials. Our findings partially alleviate concerns that over-boarded directors shirk their responsibilities. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We document that announcement-period abnormal returns of sovereign wealth fund (SWF) equity investments in publicly traded firms are positive but lower than those of comparable private investments. Further, SWF investment targets suffer from declining return on assets and sales growth over the following three years. Our results are robust to controls for target and deal characteristics and are not driven by SWF target selection criteria. Larger discounts are associated with SWFs taking seats on boards of directors and with SWFs under strict government control acquiring greater stakes, supporting the hypothesis that political influence negatively affects firm value and performance.

The present study empirically analyses the association between board of directors' composition and capital structure. Particularly, the fraction of independent directors on the board, the fraction of female directors, the board size, and whether the chief executive officer (CEO) is also the chairman of the board are analyzed. Consistent with the pecking order theory of Myers (1984) and Myers and Majluf (1984) the results provide strong evidence that firms with a larger fraction of independent directors on the board have a capital structure composed with more external capital when compared with retained earnings; have more short term debt in relation with retained earnings; have more long term debt compared with short term debt; and have more external equity than long term debt. The results also provide some evidence that a more gender diversified board of directors and where the chairman is non-executive (i.e. the CEO is a different person from that of the chairman) can improve the board of directors' independence and efficiency and therefore lead the firm to have a capital structure composed with more long term sources of financing.

One of the institutions in which the gender gap remains a contestable issue is the board of directors, where the proportion of female directors is still low. While some countries have achieved higher proportions of female directors on their corporate boards, others have not registered even a single one. Drawing on social role theory, that places emphasis on traditional gender activities, this study starts by arguing that board directorship is an agentic role and more suitable for men. The study shows that key social institutions have the potential to alleviate such stereotypical attitudes or to maintain the status quo. Employing a robust statistical technique in two-stage least squares (2SLS), this study finds that the representation of women in other key national institutions, such as in politics, positively affects the appointment of female directors on boards. On the other hand, religiosity has a negative causal effect on female board appointments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Prior studies show that agency conflicts are important in explaining corporate financial policies and that the board of directors is central to corporate governance. In this study, we examine the role of this governing body in the accumulation of cash reserves. Using a sample of 597 French listed firms during 2001-2007, we find that firms with boards deemed to be effective in mitigating agency problems--that is, those appointing independent directors and splitting chief executive officer and chair positions--accumulate less cash reserves than those with less effective boards. Moreover, two-tier boards are more efficient in mitigating the agency costs of free cash flow, leading to less corporate cash hoarding. These findings support the idea that agency conflicts influence cash management policy and that effective boards of directors play an important disciplinary role in a concentrated ownership setting.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

We provide a survey of the empirical archival literature on the effect of different facets of corporate governance on financial reporting and audit quality in China. Our survey is motivated by the burgeoning literature on the effects of some unique Chinese governance factors on the properties of accounting information. Although surveys of Chinese governance abound, we observe a lack of any comprehensive review of the governance-reporting quality literature. One of the desirable properties of good corporate governance is to improve financial reporting quality for facilitating efficient resource allocation decisions by corporate managers. However, institutional differences among countries mean that governance needs to be flexible and responsive to local demands. China offers an interesting case for evaluating the role of corporate governance because of the dominance of state-control over listed companies, the mandatory responsibility for independent boards of directors to disclose their opinions on important board decisions publicly, and a very different audit market compared to Western counterparts. The shortcomings of the surveyed research is identified along with some suggestions for future research. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine if certain board characteristics have an impact on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) score of corporations. Design/methodology/approach - The authors' paper analyzes the link between the ratings of CSR of the largest publicly traded Canadian firms (i.e. those included in the S&P/TSX 60 index) and the traits of their boards. Findings - The authors' examination concludes that the CSR score is positively linked with the percentages of women and independent directors. The study did not find a link in the cases of board characteristics, namely, director's remuneration, director's tenure and director's ownership. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on the 60 largest public Canadian firms, which are strongly scrutinized. An analysis that includes smaller firms as well may show different results. Practical implications - To improve the ability of boards of directors to deal with CSR, the appointment of women and independent directors should be given greater emphasis. Data show that all boards in their sample are composed of at least 50 per cent of independent directors, with an average of 80 per cent. Thus, there is a more limited room to ameliorate CSR by adding independent directors. In contrast, women represented, on average, only 14.25 per cent of all directors. Companies wanting to improve their CSR should consider appointing more female participation in their boards. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the extant literature on corporate governance by presenting evidence of a link between CSR and certain board characteristics.

From the perspective of agency, resource-based view, and resource-dependence theories, we explore the impact of the presence of outside directors on firm performance in family small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs). Using survey data from 369 Spanish family SMEs, our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of outsiders on the boards of first- and second-generation family firms and firm performance. The results show that a balanced presence of outside directors contributes to value creation in family SMEs and confirm that the composition and the roles of the board of directors differ from generation to generation in family firms.

An effective board of directors is central to agency theory's prescription to solving the problems of separation of ownership from control in the modern corporation. The shareholders' confidence in the board's ability to fulfil its duties is an important measure of the success or otherwise of this cornerstone of agency theory. The Board Shareholder Confidence Index focuses on the board of directors and is the standard by which Canadian governance best practices are measured. This paper investigates the relationship between board effectiveness and company performance. Using a sample of 699 firm year observations from 2003 to 2009, we find a positive association between the firm's measure of board effectiveness and the firm's contemporaneous and future market measure of performance, Tobin's Q. The results hold across a number of econometric models that control for different types of endogeneities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine corporate governance practices in an emerging economy. It focusses on how ownership control and board control systems operate in corporate organisations in an emergent economy, assuming that these systems are essential for enhancing good corporate governance practices in emerging countries.Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on descriptive multiple-case study with multiple units of analysis to divulge how ownership control and board control systems function to ensuring effective corporate governance in publicly listed corporate organisations in Ghana. A criterion-based sampling technique is used to select the companies. Thereafter, three techniques of data collection are used to gather data from the companies: archival records, semi-structured interviews and observation.Findings: By linking the gathered data to the paper's theoretical propositions, the study highlights that all the companies are characterised by the presence of large shareholders, and, in consequence, they tend to exert extensive control over the activities of the companies through their involvement in the decision-making processes. However, whilst the presence of large shareholders has the tendency to solve the agency problem, it poses challenges in regards to minority shareholders' interests in these corporate organisations. The study also reveals that boards of directors tend to exercise control over corporate organisations when majority shareholders stop interfering in their dealings. This implies that when major shareholders fully partake in corporate decision-making processes of companies, boards of directors seem to be sheer advisory bodies to management.Research limitations/implications: This is a paper to shed light on corporate governance practices in four large publicly listed corporate organisations on the Ghana Stock Exchange, so the observable facts do not apply to other emergent economies. In addition, the sample does not represent all corporate organisations in Ghana; thus, the empirical observations cannot be generalised to other organisations that have not been included in this study. However, the empirical results can be applied to other similar corporations in Ghana and other emergent economies in an analytical sense. With the application of inductive reasoning, the results can be applied to provide important appreciation in an effort to understand the structure of corporate governance practices in organisations in developing countries.Practical implications: A comparative analysis of the empirical observations from this study and the recommended guidelines of corporate governance of Ghana has been carried out, and aspects in which organisations need to reform and improve to fully comply with the guidelines are highlighted: director independence, director evaluation, introduction of new directors and board education. This could possibly be the foundation upon which corporate governance structures in these organisations can be restructured and further enhanced.Originality/value: The majority of the studies of corporate governance in emergent economies have used quantitative techniques to examine the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. However, this study takes a different approach to examine corporate governance practice in an emergent economy by using a comprehensive and defensible qualitative analysis to examine relations between ownership structure and shareholder control, and board of directors and board control. In addition, it highlights how ownership and board control systems interact in corporate organisations in emergent economies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial performance and internal governance structure of Information Technology (IT) sector in India. Various aspects of the board such as board independence, board size, board meeting, board attendance, aspects of leadership with role duality and family ownership are addressed in this study. Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 114 listed IT sector firms in India from 2006 to 2011. To account for endogeneity of the relationship between firm performance, corporate governance and capital structure of the firm, simultaneous system of equations was employed. Findings - The study, after controlling for firm-specific factors, shows that larger board size had a positive impact on firm performance. Independent directors on the board did not show any association with firm performance. The study failed to find any relationship between the number of board meetings and firm performance. However, attendance of the board members was found to be positively associated with firm performance. Family firms showed better performance compared to non-family firms. Originality/value - The study demonstrates that governance measures related to the board in Indian firms have some similarities to the firms in western countries. However, the study shows that some of the widely used board characteristic measures differ with other studies documented in the western contexts which limits the generalisability of the western studies in the emerging countries.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

Purpose - This paper aims to furnish incremental insights on dividends and corporate governance (CG) by addressing the relationship between board meeting frequency and board independence with dividend payout. In particular, this study aims to investigate whether CG attributes are substitutes to control agency problem within the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines panel data on a sample of 114 Malaysian firms (798 observations) for seven years from 2002 to 2008. Findings - Based on 798 firm-year observations for the period from 2002 to 2008, the results show significant negative relationship between CG (board independence, board meeting frequency) and dividend payout. This suggests that CG and dividend payout are substitutes in reducing agency costs. Our study provides empirical evidence consistent with the "substitution argument", indicating that firms with weak CG need to establish reputation by paying more dividends. Specifically, the findings indicate that firms with a higher proportion of independent directors and boards of director that meet more frequent pay lower dividends. Originality/value - This paper provides evidence on previously untested governance characteristics in relation to how they act as substitute mechanisms with dividends for reducing agency costs. The results builds a strong case for the fresh strand of knowledge on dividends and CG which tests each CG variables to understand each of its unique relationship with dividends in line with the dividends outcome or substitute theory.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

We established a set of corporate governance assessment indices for examining the potential intermediary role of corporate governance in the relationship between firm performance and risk; furthermore, we identified the key corporate governance variables associated with both firm performance and risk based on 2008-2012 empirical evidence from Taiwan. The results indicate that corporate governance has a suppressed mediating effect on the relationship between firm performance and risk both during and after the financial crisis. Moreover, especially during a financial crisis, corporate governance has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between firm performance and risk; therefore, it acts as a risk buffer to protect companies. Our empirical results also provide evidence that listed companies in Taiwan with higher levels of corporate governance report high firm performance and low firm risk. Based on the findings, we recommend that decision makers considering both value creation and risk control focus on formulating corporate governance strategies, with particular attention paid to annual general meetings participation, chairperson and chief executive officer split, board of directors composition, director remuneration and discipline, and transparency of board structure and ownership information.

We comprehensively examine the characteristics of the board of directors in firms characterized by disproportionate insider control. Specifically, we investigate whether board of director characteristics contribute to, or attenuate, the known negative association between a divergence of insider voting and cash flow rights and firm value. Using a new hand-collected sample of U.S. dual-class firms between 2000 and 2012, we find that disproportionate insider control is negatively associated with board experience, independence, and the tenure/age of directors. These findings support an entrenchment, rather than a substitution explanation, which would require stronger board monitoring as the extent of agency conflicts increases. Moreover, mediation analyses reveal that negative board characteristics act as one channel for the previously established negative association between disproportionate insider control and firm value.

This paper investigates the association between a range of corporate governance mechanisms and forward-looking disclosure (FLD) in a low information environment: the Chinese stock markets. It finds that the implementation of certain monitoring and control mechanisms, such as financial expertise on audit committees and independent directors on the board of directors, can improve the extent of FLD. However, the size of the supervisory board and separating the roles of the CEO and the chairman of the board of directors is of little help in explaining any improvement in FLD. In contrast, ownership structure appears to play an essential role in determining FLD policies. Indeed, listed firms with high levels of foreign ownership and fewer pyramidal layers in their ownership structure tend to disclose more forward-looking information. Of particular interest, the association between state ownership and FLD is likely to be non-linear (an inverted U-shape), and the inflection point at which the association becomes negative occurs at a state ownership over 33 percent. In summary, this study provides new evidence on the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on FLD in China's unique institutional environment. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to test the association between board of director characteristics and corporate reputation. Design/methodology/approachLogistic and multivariate regressions are performed to analyse whether the board of director characteristics are associated with the level of corporate reputation. The sample is composed of listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange (Indice General de la Bolsa de Madrid) at least once during the period 2004-2010. Corporate governance data were manually extracted from governance reports released by Spanish companies. The data for the design of a corporate reputation measure were obtained from the Monitor Espanol de Reputacion Corporativa (MERCO) institute web site. FindingsResults from the empirical analysis show that Spanish companies that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation index provided by MERCO tend to have a higher percentage of independent directors as well as more female directors on their board. Firm size and the image of the president of a firm are also linked to corporate reputation. Originality/valueThe results have direct implications for the management of corporate governance mechanisms by shareholders who should take into account their role in the creation and maintenance of corporate reputation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate governance on Tunisian hotels' performance. This study introduces different variables associated to corporate governance in the hotel industry to measure the association between corporate governance and Tunisian hotels' performance. Thus, this paper evaluates the efficiency of 63 hotels during 2011-2012 and adopts a stochastic frontier function with 16 inputs (size of board of directors, number of outside directors, institutional participation in the capital, board independence, stock ownership of board members, CEO - chair separation...). Six outputs as performance measures (financial performance, social and human performance, organizational performance, commercial performance and global performance) are specified and used to estimate hotel efficiency. The results reveal that corporate governance measures are positively and significantly associated with hotel performance, and that hotels in Tunisia are on average operating at 65.02% efficiency.

This study seeks to provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of board characteristics in constraining management opportunism, measured by real earnings management. The paper uses regression analysis to document empirical evidence regarding the impact of the independence of boards of directors and the independence of committees on real earnings management in 7,481 US firms over the period 2000 to 2009. This study contributes to empirical studies on the role of corporate governance in financial reporting quality by demonstrating the role of the independence of boards of directors and the independence of committees in constraining real earnings management. These results should contribute to providing an orientation for future regulators regarding possible amendments, especially in the wake of the current financial crisis. (c) author(s); CC-BY.

The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of internal governance mechanisms related to the board of directors, the audit committee and the ownership structure on the value relevance of accounting earnings in the French context. Using the method of Panel Corrected Standard Errors in the context of panel data, we find that the CEO duality and the existence of an audit committee have a negative effect on the value relevance of accounting earnings while the ownership concentration and the institutional ownership contribute to increase the value relevance of earnings. Furthermore, the empirical results show that leverage and growth have a positive effect on the value relevance. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Scholars and practitioners have been interested in the tasks of boards of directors, yet we know relatively little about the impact of directors' social identification on their engagement in specific board tasks. Examining the 92 largest Finnish industrial organizations, we explore how the directors' identification with the organization, its shareholders, and customers affects the extent to which the board engages in external legitimacy, networking, advice and counsel, top management monitoring, financial monitoring, strategic participation, and strategic evaluation tasks. Research Findings/Insights: Following the social identity perspective, we provide new insight to understand the relationship between board tasks and the directors' relevant identifications. We find that organizational identification is positively related to the level of board task involvement. We also discover that shareholder identification is negatively related to strategic participation tasks and only weakly related to other board tasks. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the present literature on boards of directors by applying an empirical, analytical lens to theories on how and why directors engage in board tasks. In particular, we show that different social identifications of the directors have different explanatory power towards the subsets of resource provision and monitoring tasks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of the shareholder supremacy view as the only driver of value creation for the organization. Additionally, we advocate that board, organization, and industry characteristics are similarly weak in predicting the involvement of the directors in the board tasks examined.

Purpose - The financial crisis of 2008-2009 was truly global in nature that affected all sectors and countries of the world. Being considered that a board of directors is the main governance mechanism through which a company is governed and managed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the governance structure of a company on its financial performance during the period of financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates the effect of board structure parameters - board leadership, directors and board size on the financial performance for 164 non-financial listed firms in India during the period of financial crisis of 2008-2009. Findings - The study finds a significant positive effect with Chief Executive Officer duality, executive chairperson and proportion of inside directors on the firm's financial performance. Independent directors have no significant influence, while non-executive (grey) director's being affiliated with the firm has a negative influence on firm's financial performance. A larger board has a negative relationship with the firm's financial performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to large non-financial firms of the Bombay Stock Exchange-200 index. The study may be extended to include other firms to generalize the findings. Practical implications - Results imply that during the period of financial distress, a company having more inside (or management) directors with an executive chairperson are in a better position to manage company resources with positive impact on financial performance. Companies with larger boards may find it difficult to take quick decisions, which ultimately affect their performance. Originality/value - The study is original in its idea of assessing company strategy to adopt a suitable governance structure that can sustain its performance during the period of financial crisis.

The purpose of this study is to compare, for countries with different legal environments, the degree to which boards of directors may improve corporate ethical behaviour by designing codes of ethics. These codes address issues such as a company's responsibility regarding the quality of its products and services, compliance with laws and regulations, conflicts of interest, corruption and fraud, and protection of the natural environment. Using a sample of firms from 12 countries, we obtain evidence that a greater presence of independent directors on the board leads to the existence of more complex codes of ethics. Moreover, there are significant differences between countries with high levels and countries with low levels of investor protection as regards the effectiveness of independent directors in constraining unethical behaviour by managers.

The objective of this paper is to obtain empirical evidence of the relationship between board structure, ownership composition, and the level of corporate governance transparency in the largest listed companies of Latin America. A correlational study was conducted with a longitudinal analysis using data from the largest listed comanies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010. The results show that the level of transparency is higher in companies with larger boards and with a higher percentage of independent directors. Meanwhile, the composition of ownership inhibits the level of transparency in corporate governance, while the presence of family shareholders encourages greater disclosure of corporate information.

The CLO shapes and enforces corporate governance, but is faced with a dual-role paradox that requires her to act as both monitor of corporate governance and executive of the firm. We study the role of the CLO under environments that are most likely to impact governance and pressure the firm to either emphasize or marginalize the CLO's role as monitor or facilitator. Using the financial shock of a securities class action lawsuit on large corporations, we measure changes in CLO value through the metrics of total and relative compensation of the CLO and other C-suite members. After controlling for relevant variables such as growth and total assets, we find that when firms have more insiders on their board of directors, the CLO's compensation declines when the preceding year's Tobin's Q is high. CLO compensation increases under conditions of high opacity, but that compensation partially erodes in high Tobin's Q environments. We also find that a lawsuit increases CFO and CEO turnover but not the CLO's. Our results have implications for corporate governance, the dual and potentially conflicting role of CLO as gatekeeper and monitor, executive compensation, and agency costs. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most regulations and corporate governance codes emphasize the adjective independent next to the words auditor and director because auditor and director independence is expected to result in better protection for shareholders and other stakeholders. In this study we use (1) the extent to which the auditor provides non-audit services (NAS) to clients as a possible factor influencing auditor independence and (2) the proportion of outside independent directors to the total number of directors as a proxy of board of directors' independence (BODI). The two fundamental questions are the following: (1) Does the provision of NAS by auditors to audit clients impair auditor independence, thus reducing the quality of earnings? (2) Does BODI play a role in improving earnings quality? An empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of Italian listed companies during the period 2007-2010. Our evidence does not show an influence of BODI on our proxies of earnings management. Regarding the issue of auditor independence, the provision of NAS appears to be positively associated with the absolute abnormal working capital accruals, which is an indicator of a lower quality of earnings. We also show that board characteristics are not determinants in the choice of purchasing NAS and that the new Italian regulation on mandatory disclosure of audit and NAS fees appears to have had some influence on the behavior of companies in the 2007-2010 period in the form of a reduction in the relative magnitude of NAS compared to audit fees.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structures of French initial public offering (IPO) firms and the likelihood of failure and involuntary delisting from the stock exchange in the long run.Design/methodology/approach: A matched-pairs research design was used and 36 delisted IPO firms were compared to an equal number of control IPO firms matched in terms of time, size and industry. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed, and it was found that corporate governance structures in delisted IPO firms were relatively weak compared to control IPO firms.Findings: A significant negative association was found between the likelihood of exchange delisting and the proportion of independent directors. A positive and significant relationship was also found between the likelihood of exchange delisting on the one hand and the chief executive officer/Chair role duality and the retained ownership by insiders after the IPO on the other hand. However, no relationship was detected between IPO failure risk and board size at the IPO time.Originality/value: Retained ownership and failure risk of French IPO firms.

Purpose - In 2001, the China Securities Regulatory Commission required that at least one-third of the members of corporate boards of directors come from outside the organization. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of this change of regulation on corporate governance in China. In particular, the authors examine whether the increase in the proportion of outsider directors can increase the monitoring quality of the board. Design/methodology/approach - The basic empirical methodology is a logit regression in which the dependent variable is a binary variable that represents one of the three "negative events" identified as the indicators of poor monitoring quality. The independent variables are firm-level control variables. Findings - Using Chinese stock data from 1999 to 2005, the authors find that the resulting increase in board independence has reduced the occurrence of connected transactions and violations such as financial statement fraud, illegal insider trading, and asset misappropriation. However, this positive effect of board independence is not uniform across firms. The authors show that a higher degree of fundamental uncertainty in a firm impedes the effectiveness of board independence. The authors also document that the level of board independence is positively associated with firm performance, as measured either in stock market return or accounting return. Originality/value - In this paper, the authors aim to investigate the effectiveness of outsider directors in a more direct way than has previous research. The authors measure the improvement in the quality of board monitoring by the reduction of the likelihood of those corporate events that could reduce firms' value. In particular, the authors examine the relationship between the board independence and the occurrence of "negative" corporate events in China. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study that explores the link between board independence and the probabilities of these events. (c)Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The 2011 Tunisian revolution has played a role in bringing the corporate governance agenda to the forefront. This political change in Tunisia has revealed persistent governance problems in its banking industry. This paper presents the results of research conducted on how different aspects of corporate governance can influence bank performance. The sample comprises 10 Tunisian commercial banks for the period from 1997 to 2010. The performance-governance relationship is estimated using a range of econometric techniques. The findings reveal strong support for a negative association between blockholder ownership and performance. Our results show that the bank board size is related to directors' ability to monitor and advise management. Additionally, CEO duality is positively associated with performance. Further analysis suggests that the presence of government officials on banks' board of directors decreases bank performance. Taken together, our findings offer recommendations to regulators, especially for the on-going financial reform of corporate boards.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) dominate the global business arena, but new expectations for MNC boards call to question how they might effectively manage global stakeholder relationships in this new era of accountability. Uniting political behavior theory, which describes a board's international political orientation, and global operating governance systems outlining a set of board behaviors, we develop a typology of four types of boards. We then provide recommendations for the development of an integrative governance structure, taking into account the mechanisms, structure, endorsements, and codes of conduct that MNCs can use to promote ethical behavior across MNC horizons.

This research seeks to explain the mixed results about the relationship of ownership and performance presented by other relevant studies in family and non-family businesses, mainly in emerging countries. The results confirm the positive association between family ownership concentration and performance, calculated by Tobin's Q, showing how the participation of inside shareholders on the board and a low debt level contribute to higher performance. However, the association of these variables with performance shows a contrasting effect in the case of family as compared to non-family businesses. The particular corporate legal context in Mexico could be highlighted as one of the main reasons for these results. (c) 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

It is well known that firms with low price to earnings ratios (value firms) earn higher stock returns in the long term than high price to earnings firms (growth firms). This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects. For low P/E firms, low stock returns reflect the inability of boards of directors and outside shareholders to influence poorly performing entrenched management. For high P/E firms, boards of directors and outside shareholders are less likely to intervene since higher returns reflect increased agency incentives for value-creating managers.

This study aims to investigate determinants of agency costs on agro-industrial firms that are listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Modeling of agency costs is analyzed by performing regression analysis of panel data. This study employs secondary data of 54 companies from year 2010 to 2013. The results show that agency costs are affected by the effectiveness of good governance mechanism, especially the function of board of directors (BOD) and board of commissioners (BOC) in conducting their duties, dividend payout and leverage. Whereas, independent commissioners and auditor committee are not significant factors in mitigating agency costs. Ownership concentration affects agency costs in vary. The results can help management, investors and other decision makers to implement better governance practices in agro-industrial firms in Indonesia.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The board of directors plays an important role in corporate governance. It is an internal mechanism that controls and monitors the actions of managers and aligns the utility functions between corporate owners and managers. The board of directors performs multiple functions that concern, for example, the replacement of the managers, financial policy, the preparation of strategic plans and other actions that affect the performance of the company. The board plays an important role since on the one hand it controls the actions of management and on the other it advises the management regarding the strategies to be adopted. In this study, 100 announcements regarding the appointment of the board of directors of 100 Italian listed companies during the period 2012-2014 are investigated. The results show a positive reaction within 20 days around the announcement date. In four of the six time windows, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are positive and statistically significant. The positive reaction of the market would appear, however, to be linked more to the composition of the board of directors than to the size of the board of directors.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

Corporate governance significantly effects corporate performance and this relationship is established through number of studies theoretically and empirically conducted in this field. Also, there are studies which show the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital performance. Furthermore, intellectual capital performance positively effects corporate performance as shown in the previous studies. These relationships trigger this study to explore the role of intellectual capital as a mediator between corporate governance and corporate performance relationship. This study focuses on the idea that governance measures, board of directors in this study, can contribute to the intellectual capital efficiency of the companies which in turn results in higher corporate performance. A single structural model of corporate governance, intellectual capital and corporate performance is conceptualized. In the model, board of directors, variables are taken as governance measures, Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAICTM) as intellectual capital performance measure and traditional financial measures as corporate performance measures. It is intellectual capital resources which act as mechanism through which the corporate governance is able to influence the corporate performance. Intellectual capital is taken as mediator to confirm that IC properly mediates the CG and performance relationship conceptually. This study will be beneficial for the research community to combine different areas of study under one model. This study will suggest the management and other regulatory bodies to understand the importance of intellectual capital along with governance and performance.

This study explores the relationship between the structure of company board of directors (BOD) and financial performance looking at a sample of Malaysian oil and gas companies. In order to show a link exists between BODs and financial performance of a firm, the authors examined 28 Malaysian oil and gas companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, using annual data from 2007-2011 fiscal years. A multiple regression analysis examined the relationship between the characteristics of BODs and the firms performance relying on financial ratios namely, Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA). Measures of corporate governance attributes employed are: composition of the board, CEO/Chairman duality, board size, independence of nomination committee and a risk management committee. The results revealed that an effective board size had a positive impact on financial performance for the Malaysian oil and gas industry but was the study was unable to establish if composition of the board and existence of risk management had a role. Interestingly, the findings indicate that independence of nomination committee and non-dual leadership structure are significantly and inversely related to financial performance. The outcome of the study implies that in pursuing the true spirit of corporate governance, having a board that is truly independent of management, with an appropriate number of directors is deemed vital for good financial performance.

Concentration of ownership in Malaysian public listed companies contributes to agency conflict between majority and minority shareholders. An effective monitoring mechanism is critical to mitigate this conflict. The study aims to examine the influence of board and audit committee independence, internal audit function and ownership concentration on earnings quality proxied by discretionary accruals. The sample of the study 508 companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia Main Market from 2009 to 2012. Two measures of discretionary accruals are used: Modified Jones model (Dechow et al., 1995); and extended Modified Jones Model (Yoon et al., 2006). Using OLS regression, results of the study suggest that audit committee independence and more investment in internal audit function are related to higher earnings quality. However, board of directors' independence and ownership concentration are associated with lower earnings quality. The finding indicates the importance of audit committee independence in producing quality financial reporting. Consistent findings are found for most variables in both models. The findings of the study have implication on the use of measurement of discretionary accruals in earnings quality studies and corporate governance practices in Malaysia.

Using a panel dataset for 369 firm-year observations during the period 2005-2013 in the Italian context, we investigate the impact of certain characteristics of corporate boards on the magnitude of corporate Research and Development (R&D). Our findings reveal a negative relationship between R&D and board size on the one hand and between R&D and board ownership on the other hand. Moreover, we find strong evidence of a positive and statistically significant relationship between R&D and independent corporate board directors. In addition, we also find a relationship between R&D and board diversity effect, as measured by women and foreign members on the boardroom. Our study uses multiple econometric models to address endogeneity issues. (c) 2015. All Rights Reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the moderating effects of a board of directors on foreign direct investment (FDI)'s international diversification in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of Turkish multinational firms with FDI was used. Two different aspects of international diversification were considered: the relationship between international diversification and financial performance and the moderating effect of board composition on the relationship between international diversification and the firm's financial performance. Firm-level data were obtained from the Istanbul Stock Exchange in Turkey. Findings: The findings reveal that international diversification leads to better financial performance according to market-based measures. On the other hand, this study indicates that the board characteristics have a moderating effect on international diversification and financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a sample of publicly listed firms in Turkey, and this restriction limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: The internalization efforts of Turkish FDI have led to better financial performance in terms of market-based measures. The results have stated that the interest of independent outside directors is aligned with lower-risk investment decisions. Independence of independent outside directors in Turkey is interrogated by practitioners or the Capital Markets Board of Turkey. The larger board size which a moderator variable is provided, the wider shareholder value in Turkey is. Social implications: One can understand that the development of market-supporting institutions provides the support for entry to an emerging economy which is inefficient or incomplete markets and highly concentrated family ownership. Originality/value: These findings provide important implications for corporate governance and highlight the need for further research on the role of governance in firm internationalization. This study not only helps to understand how board characteristics affect the choice of international diversification decisions, but the results also allow to assess the performance implications of these choices for a particular period.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of directors' remuneration on the firm's intrinsic and extrinsic value. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a brief review of the literature on directors' remuneration and identifies the current knowledge on the relationship between profit sharing or directors' remuneration and the firm's performance. In addition, correlation analysis between the directors' compensation and various parameters measuring the firm's performance is done. Findings - From an investor's viewpoint, the performance indicators indicated no significant relation of the increase in the firm's performance with the increase in directors' remuneration. But, from the accounting viewpoint, there exists a positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the directors' remuneration adds to the intrinsic value of the firm, but does not contribute significantly to the extrinsic value of the firm. Research limitations/implications - Future research could encompass a larger sample of companies. Also, a comparison could be done for the companies for periods before and after the modification of Clause 49 post-Satyam fiasco. The present study is done after a short period of the modification to the Clause 49. Originality/value - The study provides a unique examination of remuneration of the board of directors and the firm's performance. It studies the impact of the directors' remuneration and its impact on firm's performance. The study encompasses an exhaustive analysis for the emerging market, namely, India. The research studies 40 companies, which are unique from each other and explores the relation. It explores four parameters studying both the intrinsic and extrinsic values of the firm.

The weak corporate governance framework in Indonesia, as in other countries in Southeast Asia, was deemed a crucial factor in deepening the financial and economic crisis in the late 1990s. Over a decade after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries have made substantial governance reforms. The reform measures of the institutional framework, both in the public and corporate sectors, were intended to transform Indonesia into a clean, transparent, and accountable country. While the reforms have resulted in increased political stability, improved government effectiveness, and a more conducive investment climate, corruption remains a major concern in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate how corporate governance mechanisms can reduce the opportunities for corruption. By utilizing agency theory, we argue that a strong corporate governance institutional framework helps to reduce a country's level of corruption. We focus attention on three components of corporate governance mechanisms, i.e., shareholder rights, the quality of the board of directors (BoD), and appropriate accounting and auditing standards, including transparency standards. In an attempt to strengthen corporate governance standards and practices in Indonesia, we conducted a comparative study among Southeast Asian middle-income countries, i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We rely on accessible secondary data such as corporate governance codes, laws, and regulations. Our study concludes that the Indonesian corporate governance institutional framework is less stringent compared to Malaysia and Thailand. This condition provides a favorable environment for corruption to persist because the standards and practices are less demanding and the companies do not necessarily have to comply with the existing regulatory framework.

Purpose - This paper aims to clarify the relationship between institutional framework, concentration of ownership in family firms and results. Design/methodology/approach - Data comprises two samples of family firms from eight Latin American countries and Spain in the year 2010. The first sample contains the largest 20 corporations from each country. The second comprises the 20 largest listed family corporations in each country. To test the hypothesis, the study uses ordinary least squares. Findings - First, firms located in countries with a higher than average quality of the institutional and regulatory frameworks are less concentrated in ownership than firms located in countries with lower than average quality and development of institutional and regulatory framework. Second, the influence of the concentration of the ownership in the performance is more important in countries with higher developed institutional and regulatory frameworks. Finally, first-generation large family firms obtain higher results than large family firms in second generation or beyond. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to one year and there are few family firms in Latin American countries. The study only considers some features of ownership, and there is no information about board of directors' composition. Practical implications - Institutional framework determines concentration of ownership in family firms and the influence of concentration of ownership in performance. Originality/value - The study provides new evidence in areas of corporate governance and family firms, analysing a sample of Latin American and Spanish firms, representatives of the civil legal system and a weaker institutional framework. The study uses the corruption perception index like a control variable. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study argues that in emerging economies where formal institutions are weak, firms pursuing shareholder value may decrease other stakeholders' interests and corporate social performance (CSP). Using data from Taiwan, an Asian emerging economy, this study finds that board ownership - which aligns board members' incentives with those of shareholders and increases board members' incentives to pursue shareholder value - decreases CSP, suggesting that firms pursuing shareholder value may decrease CSP in an emerging economy. However, independent outside directors, not being large shareholders, may balance shareholders' influence on the board and protect other stakeholders, which may increase CSP.

This article investigates the link between corporate governance practices and firm performance, a topic that received a lot of attention by regulators, interest groups and academics. Research in this field has recently shifted from the analysis of one or more specific governance provisions to the analysis of multiple aspects of corporate governance. In fact, most studies now use corporate governance indexes that capture a wide range of corporate governance provisions (index-based studies). The objective and main contribution of this article is to revisit the governance- performance relationship while taking into account shareholders' proximity to the locus of management. Shareholders' proximity is defined based on ownership concentration and whether or not the dominant/controlling shareholder holds top executive positions in the firm. The lowest level of proximity is evidenced in firms with dispersed ownership, the highest level in controlled entities where the controlling shareholder holds the CEO and/or Chair positions. Governance is measured on a global scale using the Report on Business (ROB) index. The study is conducted over a 4-year period (2002-2005) using panel regressions in a two-stage least squares framework on a sample of Canadian publicly traded companies (470 firm-year observations). The results of the study show a positive relationship between the ROB global index (and sub-indexes) and Tobin's Q whether ownership is dispersed or is concentrated in the hands of a dominant or controlling shareholder. Shareholders' proximity to management has no impact on the governance-performance relationship. Overall, the results support a one-size-fits-all approach to governance, a policy adhesion that underlined the widespread adoption of Codes of Good Governance and legal/ regulatory changes in the years following Enron's collapse in the United States. Initiatives were in large part supported by a general consensus toward a stock market-centered model of governance. However, with the recent debt crisis in the United States, public perception has changed. The credibility of such a model for governing our institutions is called into question. Our study tempers these concerns by showing that governance controls should not account for ownership differences in the context of publicly traded companies. Instead, good governance practices based on an independent board of directors that promotes transparency and protects shareholders' rights should be prioritized whether or not ownership is dispersed or concentrated. From a corporate governance standpoint, this study sheds new light on controlled companies. Our results show that improving transparency and control adds value to all publicly traded companies including those with concentrated ownership. Moreover, if holding the CEO and/or Chair positions has the potential to increase the power of a dominant/controlling shareholder, it does not seem to translate into higher agency costs to the firm, nor does the presence of insiders seems to affect the effectiveness of the controls in place. Publicly traded companies may therefore welcome dominant/controlling shareholders in key management positions without compromising on firm performance and value. In any case, putting in place good governance practices seems essential to ensure that managers/shareholders are kept in check and work in the best interests of their company.

This study uses data on Japanese listed companies for the period from 2009 to 2012 to examine the incentive factors for the (non-)disclosure of material weakness (MW) in internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). The propensity score matching results of matched and potential MW companies from the research sample reveal that companies that do not disclose MW have longer management tenure, Big 3 auditors, lower audit fees, larger boards of directors, fewer outside directors, and greater main bank involvement than those companies that disclose MW. In addition, the non-disclosure of MW at the company level is associated with longer management tenure, larger management shareholdings, and greater main bank involvement, whereas the non-disclosure of MW at the account-specific level is associated with longer management tenure, Big 3 auditors, lower audit fees, significant non-audit services, and greater main bank involvement. These results suggest that the assessment and audit process of internal control systems in Japan is sensitive to management- and audit-related (non-)disclosure incentives. The findings provide useful academic insights as well as practical guidance for companies in Japan, the United States, and other countries. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Our aim is to examine the impact of corporate governance mechanisms (board of directors, ownership structure and audit committee) on the level of R&D voluntary disclosure. For a sample composed by 20 firms belonging to the SBF 250 index, we have analysed their annual reports for a period from 2005 to 2008. Results show that the size of the board of directors and the institutional ownership have a significant effect on the level of R&D voluntary disclosure. The family ownership seems to be significant, but at a less significant level. (c) Copyright 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study provides an overview of the research in the field of agency theory and corporate governance. This research is aimed to extend existing research contributes to the agency theory literature and particularly, the growing body of literature of corporate governance mechanisms. The agency theory suggests that corporate governance can reduce agency costs which in turn leads to improved firm performance. The problem that occurs is known as the principal-agent problem where two parties, the principal and the agent. The separation of ownership and control in the open financial system can result in the agency problem between management and shareholders. The separation of control and ownership in corporations has caused agency problems and a series of corporate governance mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate them. The primary objective of corporate governance can play an important role in minimizing the agency problem and ensuring that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The agency theory implies that the board of directors is elected to manage the potential conflict of interests between management and shareholders. (c) Medwell Journals, 2015.

This study analyzes the effect of shareholders' agreement binding provisions on firm value. Using a database of 181 publicly listed firms from the special segments of the BM&FBovespa, between 2008 and 2012, we analyze the effect of the inclusion of generic and specific clauses into the shareholder agreement bind director's vote to the agreement on firm value. The results indicate a negative effect of the shareholders' agreement on firm value. This effect is higher in the presence of generic clauses and lower in the presence of specific clauses, even after controlling for the endogeneity of the shareholders' decision to adopt shareholder agreements. The results allow us to conclude that controlling shareholders use the shareholder agreements as a mechanism to enhance control at the expense of firm value (entrenchment effect). This article contributes to the literature on governance and corporate finance to reveal practices that weaken the role of one of the main pillars of governance, the board of directors.

Using 3,019 listed firms in China divided into two subsamples, we compare the characteristics of corporate governance between private firms and State Owned Enterprise (SOE) firms after they have gone public on the Chinese stock markets. We examine the differences in board structure between these two types of firms. Results show that private firms and SOE firms have different governance characteristics. Our analysis indicates that in China, although private firms and SOE firms have theoretically become public firms, the SOE firms are relatively superior to the private firms in corporate governance efficiency, especially in appointing high-caliber independent directors.

Purpose - This study aims to examine whether company characteristics determine the structure and composition of a company's board. In particular, it investigates the three board-design choices that Australian-listed companies make in the context of Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) corporate governance principles (published in 2003) where they are allowed to depart from the recommended best-practice board structure if the departure better serves their unique board and governance requirements. Design/methodology/approach - A logistic regression is performed on a cross-section of data for 258 ASX-listed companies averaged over the years 2004 to 2007, using the company variables size, age, leverage, ownership concentration, profitability, liquidity, price-earnings ratio, market-to-book ratio and cross-listing. Findings - The study finds that size has a strong, statistically significant impact on all three principles. Ownership concentration, price-earnings ratio and age have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of compliance with at least one principle but have no consistent influence over all. This finding supports the underlying philosophy of the ASX corporate governance principles that flexible guidelines serve companies better than inflexible rules. Originality/value - This study breaks new ground in empirically investigating the effect of company variables on compliance with the ASX's Principles of 2003, which are new for Australia in requiring an "if not, why not" response from companies.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of political presence on profitability in Spanish savings banks. Together with political connections, the paper analyzes the effects of chairmen's banking experience on the efficiency of the savings banks. Design/methodology/approachInformation was collected from all the savings banks in the sample for the period 2002-2009. The database used combines time series with cross-section data to give a panel of data to be estimated with this methodology. FindingsAfter differentiating between municipal and regional participation, the results show that regional participation causes lower efficiency in a savings bank. There is no evidence that the financial experience of the chairman is an aspect that improves savings banks' profitability. Originality/valueThe analyses undertaken in this paper help to detect whether certain corporate governance practices affect stakeholders' interests and the economy as a whole, through their effects on economic and financial interests, like the efficiency of savings banks. The paper lends support to the recent legal reforms aimed at reducing political presence on the boards of savings banks. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the relationship between board holdings, compensation and the turnover of underperforming mutual fund managers. Previous studies find that some fund managers consistently underperform their peers over long periods of time. The presence of these consistent underperforming funds might be partially explained by ineffective monitoring whereby board interests are not aligned with those of shareholders. Based on 2003 data collected from 606 mutual funds, our results provide evidence that underperforming fund managers have a lower probability of being replaced when their boards have lower holdings and higher compensation.

India's top notch IT solutions provider "Satyam Inc," the recipient of the Golden Peacock Award for best corporate governance practices collapsed after its Chairman declared high level mismanagement with the company's accounts and the involvement of stewards of the company. Enron's debacle took the entire Wall Street by a sense of shock and disbelief. People found it difficult to believe as to how come such a behemoth corporation disappeared overnight. Worldcom, crushed by its $ 41 billion debt load, made its filing in the Southern District of New York. With $ 107 billion in assets, WorldCom's bankruptcy is the largest in United States history, dwarfing that of Enron Corp. In June 2005, Dennis Kozlowski, CEO of Tyco Electronics was convicted of misappropriating more than $ 400 million of Tyco's corporate funds. He is currently serving at least 8 years and 4 months at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York. HealthSouth Scandal (2003), Freddie Mac (2003), American Insurance Group (2005), and Lehman Brothers (2008) are some of the corporate scandals that rocked the corporate world and shattered investors' confidence. The study highlighted prominent characteristics of different corporate governance models in action around the world, their salient features, and whether convergence is in the offing for these models. It also illustrated three different instances of corporate governance failure in companies based in different governance models following countries.

This paper explores whether the performance of publicly-listed family-controlled firms in Malaysia is related to the extent of the families' ownership. It also explores whether there are any moderating effects from the various attributes of board independence on the ownership-performance relationship of these firms. The findings indicate that increasing families' ownership is related to better firm performance under the condition that the families do not have absolute ownership and control over their firms. However, giving more control via majority ownership that causes the families to become the only dominant party might enhance their ability to expropriate and cause firm performance to deteriorate. Therefore, proposal to increase ownership as a mean to reduce the classical agency-theory problems should be caveated under the principal-principal perspective. It is also found that the various board independence attributes do not exhibit any moderating influence on the family ownership-firm performance relationship. This finding may indicate the powerlessness of the boards of director in Malaysia when encountered with the influential controlling families whom the directorship tenures and opportunities of the non-family directors depend on. Decisions made by the controlling families which have bearing on firm performance may not have been effectively counter checked by the boards due to the lack of truly independent nature of the boards.

Prior studies often assume that governance provisions restrict shareholders' ability to replacemanagers. However, current literature provides no evidence that firms with a higher number of provisions are less likely to replace the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). This study examines CEO replacements following corporate acquisitions. It documents that CEOs of firms with a higher number of provisions make acquisitions that generate negative bidder returns; however, these CEOs are less likely to leave the firm within 5 years after the acquisition announcement. Some evidence suggests that governance provisions reduce the sensitivity of CEO turnover to bidder returns. The results are especially strong for the staggered board indicator. Acquiring CEOs of firms with staggered boards are less likely to leave the firms voluntarily; they are less likely to face internal discipline from the board of directors and external disciple from the takeover market. Thus, the deployment of governance provisions weakens internal and external discipline of acquiring CEOs. (c) Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

This book develops a new framework - the stakeholder model - that helps to understand corporate finance and governance in modern society, where the sources of people's happiness have shifted from monetary to non-monetary factors. The book takes a more comprehensive approach than is typically found in the standard economics and finance literature, by explicitly incorporating both the monetary and non-monetary interests of stakeholders and by examining the value creation of corporations from a much broader perspective. Specifically, the book addresses contemporary issues concerning corporate finance and governance worldwide, including: How should we define corporate value in stakeholder society? What is the role of modern corporations? What are the principles underlying corporate financing decisions? To what extent should shareholder rights be enhanced? What determines the effectiveness of a company's board of directors? What missions do firms set out and what is the role of mission statements? How can we understand the diversity of financial and governance systems among different countries? What legal and institutional reforms enhance or diminish corporate value in stakeholder society? The book will answer these questions theoretically and empirically. (c) 2015 Shinichi Hirota. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the nature of the collaborations of the foreign investor with the local family business groups, drawing out a range of possible implications on performance. Embracing a multi-theoretical approach, we use a panel data regression analysis on a sample of non-financial companies listed in Istanbul Stock Exchange during the period of 1999-2002. We find that the interaction of the foreign investor with local business groups may have both positive and negative consequences on performance, depending on the nature of the collaboration. In the case of local firms, there is a positive relationship between performance and the presence of a chairman who is a member of the family that owns the business group. Having such a chairman seems to have a negative effect on performance when foreign investors are involved. However, equity partnership with a local family business group contributes positively to the performance of foreign-involved companies. (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The global financial crisis of 2008 aroused renewed interest in the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms to safeguard investor interests. In this paper, we measure the effects of the crisis from 2008 to 2009 on the share performance of 976 companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the Hong Kong SAR and examine the link between share performance and corporate governance mechanisms. Our results present evidence that firms with a higher proportion of independent directors and a greater concentration of ownership had lower share performance, but lower price volatility, during the global financial crisis. These results suggest that no single corporate governance mechanism is fit for all economic environments and time frames. To strengthen investors' confidence, companies should enhance the efficiency and adaptability of their governance mechanisms in turbulent times. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

A company with CSR devotion reflects this company aims not only in making profit, but also in sustainability. Family-owned companies have possessed of both control and operation right of the company, and family will devote themselves in CSR to signal the company's commitment and then gains good image in order to sustainable and to maximize family benefit, The result indicated a positive relation between sustainability and the percentage of control shareholding, and negative relations between sustainability and two kinds of characteristic of family firms, which are the internal degree of the Board of Directors and the firm directed by single family. The evidence can offer stakeholders or the public to judge or predict the future development of the family firm. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of appointing foreign directors on the foreign acquired Turkish banks. Based on the developments in the Turkish banking system and the distinctive features of the Turkish market, the authors examine the appointment of foreign directors in three different levels: as a CEO, chairman and board member. The authors analyse how the appointments of foreign directors in each of these three levels affects the profitability and strategies of foreign acquired banks. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the difference-in-difference (DID) model where the authors compare two groups: foreign acquired banks vs domestic banks for a five-year period. By applying the DID model, the authors aim to remove the time invariant individual characteristics of the banks that could be due to the permanent differences between the two groups, as well as biases from comparisons over time that could be due to trends. Findings - The authors find that the presence of the foreign chairman has a positive effect on the profitability of the foreign acquired bank and on the improvement of the income generated from interest activities, indicating that foreign chairman improves the monitoring of board of directors and brings new skills and experiences. Furthermore, foreign acquired banks are associated with an increase in the income generated from non-interest activities in the fifth year following their acquisitions, showing the introduction of new strategies. The change of the foreign acquired bank's strategies in the fifth year after acquisition also suggests that it takes time to implement new strategies in a new environment. Originality/value - Though the effects of foreign board membership on bank's performance have been previously discussed in literature, this study differentiates in that it distinguishes among different positions, e.g. chairman or CEO when examining the effect of a foreign director on a foreign acquired bank's performance. In addition, the use of foreign acquired Turkish banks in the sample in this context adds to the general academic literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This chapter has two purposes. The first is to consider why the managers of Japanese companies are reticent about appointing outside directors, despite strong pressure from foreign investors to make such appointments. The second is to empirically examine the relationship between the appointment of outside directors and the performance of Japanese companies that are listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). My investigation reveals that the managers of TSE listed companies do not feel the need to appoint outside directors as they are satisfied with the current corporate governance system. This includes a board comprising at least three statutory auditors, of whom more than half are outside auditors, as well as the checks and balances provided by the board of directors. In addition, outside directors are expected to supervise management, but they are not necessarily required to become involved in managerial decision making. Some empirical studies, which analyze U.S. and Japanese companies, show no apparent enhancement of corporate performance by the appointment of outside directors. The results presented in this chapter confirm the findings of these studies and show that there is little likelihood that the appointment of outside directors has any significantly positive effect on corporate performance. This is likely to be a reflection of the above noted fact that managers in TSE listed companies do not necessarily expect outside directors to become involved in managerial decision making.

There is a serious agency problem when a board of directors' remuneration is not linked with performance. Therefore, a remuneration committee's role is to ensure the remuneration follows proper policies and procedures. This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and remuneration as moderated by the remuneration committee. Its sample size is 386 firms listed in Bursa Malaysia studied from 2007 to 2009. Findings from this study indicate a significant positive relationship between remuneration committees and remuneration, which suggests the effectiveness of the committees. Furthermore, evidence from this study shows that the board of directors has a significant negative influence on non-executives' remuneration. Our study suggests that the non-executive director has less power in remunerative decisions than the executive director, reducing his or her own remuneration. However, this study cannot find evidence of a relationship between the board of directors and executive remuneration. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Classical economic theories establishing a relationship between CEO remuneration and firm performance has paid particular attention to solve conflict of interest between managerial team and firm shareholders, by designing an optimum CEO remuneration that motivate executives to work in the best interest of shareholders. Many international and less Australian empirical researches suggest that there is overwhelming evidence that firm performance is strongly linked with CEO remuneration. In this paper, we reassess the association of firm performance and CEO remuneration variables using dynamic econometric models and comprehensive data from Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We find a positive and strong association between CEO pay of top 200 Australian public listed companies and company performance. Obtained findings are similar to USA, UK and Canada studies results. We further test the effect of board and ownership features on CEO remuneration-performance sensitivity in the top 200 Australian public companies listed on ASX. Specifically, for the period of 2003-2007, our results highlight the importance of ownership structure in influencing remuneration-performance relationship. Monitoring block holders boost the responsiveness of long term incentives (LTI) remuneration to performance, thus straightening shareholder and manager welfares. However, based on a short term investment horizon strategy, insider block holders increase (decrease) the sensitivity of short-term incentives remuneration (long term incentives pay). Surprisingly, for the period 2008-2013, our findings suggest that ownership and board features did not influence significantly CEO pay-performance sensitivities. Finally, we find that larger boards increase (decrease) the responsiveness of CEO's known remuneration (long term incentives) to performance. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This paper tries to answer the question of top management, public policy makers, researchers and scholars of how important the role of Corporate Governance (CG) and best practices are. Although there are plenty of previous researches, we find it necessary to conduct this study because we believe the outcome will be significant to Bolivia's corporate governance and best practices in order to support and validate the application of the CG's code as management strategy. Likewise, the lack of academic research about this subject in a developing country where these kinds of practices are just starting to be promoted is an important fact, enlightening firms to consider this public policy in order to be more competitive and efficient. We use Pearson's correlations analysis in contrast with multiple regression analysis to examine the significance of Board of directors' characteristics on financial performance ratios and the influence on firm value.

The purpose of the Bahraini corporate governance code is to put the principles of best corporate governance practices into place, and to provide protection to the stakeholders of the company and its investors through compliance with those principles. International experience has shown that the results of good corporate governance are enhanced value of the companies, protecting the investors and attracting investments. This paper examines two empirical studies. First, it examines the relation between the corporate governance characteristics including financial expertise of the board, independent members' composition, frequency of the meeting of committee of audit and boards of directors, board size and the quality of the audit. Secondly, the study examines the efficiency of higher-quality auditors and corporate governance characteristics in constraining earnings management. (c) 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

This case study examines strategic management issues related to corporate governance and CEO-Chair duality, which have led to the use of power and family control of a very profitable and successful public holding company that dominated the insurance industry in Palestine for 20 years. It specifically describes the incidents that made Hayat Insurance Company (HIC) vulnerable and unable to choose the right strategies to cope with external threats, such as the rising competition and the developing regulations during the 1990s. With government interventions, the situation deteriorated, and HIC was dissolved. The selected solution, to liquidate HIC by selling its license to another insurance company, was thought to be for the best interest of the various stakeholder groups. The case is based on interviews with major stakeholders including insurance experts, shareholders, board of directors, former employees and managers, and government officials in various departments.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

The study aimed to analyze between families of different economic sectors of the BM&FBovespa Brazilian companies are those listed in different levels of governance, boards of smaller and independent directors had a better quality of accounting information. Quantitative research conducted with 96 family companies. To analyze the quality of information, we used four characteristics: (Bushman et al., 2004) persistence of the results and cash flow (Dechow e Schrand, 2004), conservatism (Ball e Shivakumar, 2005) and opportunity; relevance (Ohlson, 1995). In relation to corporate governance, it is concluded that the adoption of different levels of governance BM&FBovespa and greater independence of the board influence to greater persistence, conservatism, opportunism and relevance of accounting information occurs. However, it was not possible to conclude that the size of the board influences the quality of accounting information. (c) 2015 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance on firm performance for a large representative sample. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical analysis focuses on a large number of companies covering 20 important industries of the Indian manufacturing sector for the period 2001-2010. Several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes, including system generalized methods of moments, which effectively overcomes the problem of endogeneity and simultaneity bias. Findings: On one side, the findings indicate that larger boards are associated with a greater depth of intellectual knowledge, which in turn helps in improving decision-making and enhancing the performance. On the other side, the results indicate that return on equity and profitability is not related to corporate governance indicators. The results also suggest that CEO duality is not related to any firm performance measures for the sample firms. Practical implications: The outcomes of the analyses advocated that companies that comply with good corporate governance practices can expect to achieve higher accounting and market performance. It implies that good corporate governance practices lead to reduced agency costs. Hence, it is concluded that firms of the developing world can possibly enhance their performance by implementing good corporate governance practices. Originality/value: Departing from the conventional system of the prior studies and instead of focusing on a single measure framework, a range of measures of corporate governance and firm's performance variables are used. Also, several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes. Furthermore, the sample also covers a large sample of manufacturing firms.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript type: Review Research Question/Issue: Bank governance has become the focus of a flurry of recent research and heated policy debates. However, the literature presents seemingly conflicting evidence on the implications of governance for bank risk-taking. The purpose of this paper is to review prior work and propose directions for future research on the role of governance on bank stability. Research Findings/Insights: We highlight a number of key governance devices and how these shape bank risk-taking: the effectiveness of bank boards, the structure of CEO compensation, and the risk management systems and practices employed by banks. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Prior work primarily views bank governance as a mechanism to protect the interests of bank shareholders only. However, given that taxpayer-funded guarantees protect a substantial share of banks' liabilities and that banks are highly leveraged, shareholder-focused governance may well subordinate the interests of other stakeholders and exacerbate risk-taking concerns in the banking industry. Our review highlights the need for internal governance mechanisms to mitigate such behavior by reflecting the needs of shareholders, creditors, and the taxpayer. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review argues that the relationship between governance and risk is central from a financial stability perspective. Future research on issues highlighted in the review offer a footing for reforming bank governance to constrain potentially undesirable risk-taking by banks. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of corporate governance quality on earnings management in Jordan. Using a panel data set of all industrial and service firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) during the period 2009-2013; this paper provides evidence that earnings management is affected negatively by corporate governance quality. In particular; the results show that earnings management is affected negatively by overall categories of governance index represented by board of director, board meeting, Audit and nomination and compensation committee. Furthermore, results suggest that corporate governance quality has increased over time. Thus, its ability to constrain earnings management has also increased. It is recommended to industrial and service companies to boost their compliance with corporate governance code to improve the integrity and reliability of financial reports. This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance quality on earnings management in Jordan as an emerging economy.

While US companies mainly list their board of directors alphabetically, this is not the case for Chinese companies, most of which list their independent directors last. We interpret the listing order of Chinese directors as board hierarchy, reflecting power allocation within the board. Based on extant evidence that independent directors contribute to firm value and that empowered individuals have more influence in group decision making, we expect independent-director rankings to be positively associated with firm value and find evidence consistent with this prediction. In our supplementary analyses we explore the mechanisms through which empowered independent directors enhance firm value. We find that independent directors who are ranked higher are more likely to vote against the management, especially on financial reporting issues. Further, higher independent-director rankings are associated with less earnings management. Our study suggests that empowering independent directors increases firm value. (c) 2016

This study attempts to identify the main factors influencing dividend policy in MENA emerging markets during the period between 2004 and 2013. Using panel data analysis, the study documents that dividend policy is positively related to size, current profit, and liquidity and negatively associated with leverage, growth, free cash flow and the state of the economy. The negative relationship with free cash flow could be indicative of potential agency problems in this region. This relationship is more pronounced in markets with high information asymmetry and weak investors' protection. Managers of MENA firms seem to increase dividend payouts during economic slumps in an attempt to reassure investors fearing insiders' expropriation. These signals become irrelevant when country governance mechanisms are powerful and investor protection is factual. Understanding dividend policy enhances the forecast of dividend payments and the choice of the appropriate valuation models, which increase investors' confidence and boost market activity and economic growth. Evidence of agency problems in MENA markets could persuade regulators to instigate new and foster existing governance mechanisms to address this prominent issue. The results should encourage policy makers, board of directors, analysts, institutional investors as well as other investors to scrutinize corporate governance issues to restore the integrity of local markets.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We survey the literature on corporate governance in banks in the US and international settings. We discuss how the specialness of banks, deposit insurance, high bank leverage, and bank regulation interact with bank governance. We evaluate bank governance from three perspectives: (1) maximizing bank equity value, (2) maximizing total enterprise value, and (3) maximizing social objectives. Our survey includes evidence on how bank governance differs from that of manufacturing firms. We also survey studies on managerial incentives in banks and their implications for bank performance and risk taking before and during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Research Findings/Insights: The high leverage (usually above 90 percent) of banking institutions gives rise to a trade-off between strengthening equity governance and maximizing enterprise value. Aligning managers very closely with shareholders can give rise to strong incentives for risk shifting to the detriment of firm value. The bank risk choices might also go against the societal objectives of a stable financial system. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We provide a framework for the optimal design of bank governance and bank regulation, considering the objectives of both depositors and society-at-large in addition to those of bank shareholders. This framework could be especially important in determining risk choices by banks and the effects of such on the stability of the financial system. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our analysis of the literature surveyed has policy implications for bank regulation, top-management compensation in banks, and directives for design of governance in banks. We discuss implications for direct regulation of banks and regulation of bank governance. The findings surveyed provide guidance for board independence, board size, board composition, and incentive features in top-management compensation. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Does state ownership breed risk-taking behavior in commercial banks? This paper examines this issue using a panel of Chinese banks. We find that state-ownership is in general associated with higher risks. In addition, we find that banks controlled by the central government have the highest credit risk, while those owned by local governments have the lowest capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio. By compiling a complete list of cross-border acquisitions in China's banking sector, we investigate the impact of foreign acquisition on state-owned banks' risk-taking using differences-in-differences and matching estimators. We find that foreign acquisition has a reducing effect on state-owned banks' risk-taking and this effect is particularly significant for banks that are controlled by central or local government. We also find that this risk-reducing effect depends on the percentage of foreign ownership, the local business involvement of the foreign investors, and the number of foreign members on the banks' boards of directors.

ABSTRACT: We investigate how politicians serving on the boards of directors influence firm performance. The results show a negative relationship between political connections and firm performance. Specifically, politically connected firms underperform nonconnected firms directors by almost 17 percent and 15 percent based on return on assets and return on equity, respectively. By stratifying the sample duration into two periods based on the political environment, we find that this effect is more pronounced in autocratic as opposed to democratic regimes. Finally, our results also suggest that the performance of connected firms with more growth opportunities is not affected by political connections. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and mandatory disclosure compliance (measured by International Financial Reporting Standards requirements) in firms listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) in 2010. Design/methodology/approach: Several characteristics are used to assess the effectiveness of the board of directors: number of members, gender diversity, CEO duality, multiple directorships, the proportion of family members on the board and the presence of a member of the ruling family of Kuwait. Mandatory disclosure compliance is measured using a self-constructed, item-based index. A regression model tested the paper's hypotheses. Findings: After controlling for firm-specific characteristics, it was found that board size, gender diversity and multiple directorships were positively correlated with compliance, while CEO duality and the proportion of family members on the board were negatively correlated with compliance. Research limitations/implications: Potential limitations stem from both the nature of the sample and the dataset. The small sample reflects the size of the KSE and the limited timeframe (a one-year period). Nevertheless, this paper provides some interesting insights. A longitudinal study would provide more comprehensive insights into the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and mandatory disclosure compliance over time. Practical implications: The findings highlight the effectiveness of board of directors' characteristics in promoting mandatory accounting compliance. As disclosure is fundamental for the effective functioning of capital markets and sound investments, a direct implication is that the quality of financial reporting can be improved by taking these characteristics into account. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of mandatory accounting compliance. The findings highlight the importance of the board of directors' role in enhancing transparency and ensuring the quality of financial reporting. The findings will be particularly valuable to those involved in the appointment of directors, who should be aware of the influence of the configuration and characteristics of the board on compliance.

In this article, we aim to study the impact on dividends policy of gender diversity on the board of directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of the impact of corporate governance factors on the disclosure of internal control information by firms in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - A data set from 110 firms in Ghana for the year ending of 2013 was used. Each annual report was individually examined and coded to obtain the disclosure of internal control information index. Descriptive analysis was performed to provide the background statistics of the variables examined. This was followed by regression analysis, which forms the main data analysis method. Findings - Results of the disclosure of internal control information mean of 35 per cent indicate that most of the sampled firms did not disclose sufficient internal control information in their annual reports. The low level of internal control information disclosure cannot be used by stakeholders to determine the level of corporate governance practices in the sampled companies. The results of the regression analysis indicate that board independence is a significant variable that explains the disclosure of internal control disclosure. This supports the generally held view that independent directors help to improve the quality of disclosure and increase the transparency of information. Originality/value - This is the first study in Ghana that considered the impact of corporate governance factors on internal control information disclosures. This study contributes to the literature on the relationship between corporate governance and disclosure by showing that the disclosure of internal control information in Ghana is associated with the proportion of independent board members. This findings support Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 404 requirements, even though this is not compulsory for Ghanaian firms unlike their US counterparts. The findings of this study will help market regulators in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa, Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Sub-Saharan African Exchanges in evaluating the adequacy of the current disclosure regulations in their countries. Understanding the board composition and their impact on voluntary disclosure provides evidence on the sufficiency of the board of directors' guidelines in the corporate governance code in Sub-Saharan African countries.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of women on the board of directors on corporate tax avoidance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use multivariate regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female directors on the board and tax aggressiveness. They also test for self-selection bias in the regression model by using the two-stage Heckman procedure. Findings - This paper finds that relative to there being one female board member, high (i.e. greater than one member) female presence on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias and using several alternative measures of tax aggressiveness. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the extant literature on corporate governance and tax aggressiveness. This study is subject to several caveats. First, the sample is restricted to publicly listed Australian firms. Second, this study only examines the issue of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness in the context of Australia. Practical implications - This research is timely, as there has been increased pressure by government bodies in Australia and globally to develop policies to increase female representation on the board of directors. Originality/value - This study is the first to provide empirical evidence concerning the association between the presence of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' composition (independent directors' ratio, board size, CEO-duality) and financial transparency and disclosure (T&D). Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes board composition and financial T&D of Italian listed companies using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The results of this paper show a significant link between board composition and the level of financial T&D. In particular, the authors found a positive and significant relationship between the independent directors' ratio and the level of financial T&D and a negative relationship between board size and the level of financial T&D. Research limitations/implications: While this paper focuses on a sample of 100 Italian listed companies, the authors acknowledge the importance of extending the results to other national context and to other type of firms (e.g. non-listed firms or SMEs). Moreover, while this paper concerns the amount of information disclosed by firms, it does not look at the quality or accuracy of disclosure. Practical implications: This paper reveals the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms (such as board composition) in enhancing the level of financial T&D. Indeed, the authors provide some indications to firms to improve their internal governance mechanisms (e.g. the importance of high proportion of independent directors and of small- and medium-sized boards of directors). Originality/value: This paper provides interesting insights to firms which are under pressure to improve the level of information to stakeholders. Moreover, has the level of information that is not legally required vary among companies and countries, the authors shed light on a context characterized by high level of ownership concentration, where firms can experience different types of conflict of interests.

Purpose: The authors explore the level and determinants of compliance with Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institution's (AAOIFI) financial and governance standards by Islamic banks (IBs). Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 43 IBs across eight countries. The authors use ordinary least squares regression analyses to examine the impact of bank-specific characteristics and corporate governance (CG) mechanisms concerned with Board of Directors (BOD) and Sharia Supervisory Board (SSB) on the levels of compliance with AAOIFI standards. Findings: The paper finds that the average compliance level based on AAOIFI standards concerning the SSB is 68 per cent; corporate social responsibility (CSR) is 27 per cent; and presentation of financial statements (FSs) is 73 per cent. The aggregate disclosure based on the three indices is 56 per cent. The analysis also shows that size, existing Sharia-auditing department, age and CG of SSB are the main determinants of compliance levels. Originality/value: The determinants of compliance with AAOIFI standards for IBs around the world have not been explored before, and therefore, this paper is the first of its kind to this issue.

This study examines whether the presence of ruling family members on boards of directors influences the extent and the quality of risk reporting. Based on a sample of publicly listed financial firms of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries between 2007 and 2011, our regression results show that ruling family board members reduce the quality and extent of risk disclosures. Firms with ruling family board members also disclose significantly less during periods of financial distress and when they are subject to higher levels of risk. We find that risk reporting is negatively associated with the existence of a ruling family director acting as the board chairperson, negatively associated with increasing proportions of ruling family directors on the board, and negatively associated with increasing numbers of board members who are connected to ruling family directors. Our results suggest that politically connected directors seize private benefits at the expense of their firms' shareholders. Our regression results hold after a series of robustness checks that control for endogeneity and for alternative measures of ruling family membership. (c) 2016 University of Illinois

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance by companies listed on the Palestinian Stock Exchange. Accounting and market performance measures were used to proxy corporate performance. Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

We study the effect of board size on firm value in Australia. Using a large sample of Australian firms over the period 2001-2011, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship. We show that firms with a large board are associated with CEO compensation that is sensitive to firm size, but not to firm performance. This incentive to accumulate assets is congruent with the fact that firms with a large board also exhibit lower operating performance and higher operating costs. Furthermore, we find that the effect of board size is stronger in small firms. This result might explain why earlier studies, which focused on large Australian firms, found board size to have little impact on firm value. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This essay analyses the relationship between corporate governance practices and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) wages from a sample of Portuguese listed companies over the period from 2002 to 2011. The relationship between CEO total compensation and shareholders return, firm characteristics, CEO characteristics, board of directors and shareholders characteristics is analysed. It is found that firm specific factors accounts for the majority of the variance in total CEO pay, while firm performance accounts for less than 5%. It is also found that the CEO characteristics, board of directors' structures, and shareholders features are related with the CEO pay. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the compliance of Saudi shareholding companies with the requirements of corporate governance issued by the Board of Capital Market Authority in the Kingdom and their impact on earnings management. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was used to collect data about the compliance of the Saudi shareholding companies with corporate governance requirements and discretionary accruals (DAs) were calculated from the financial statements of these companies using the modified Jones model, then multiple regression was used to test the relationship between the variables. Findings - The results of the study revealed that there was no statistically significant linear dependence of the mean of DAs on corporate governance. Additionally, no statistically significant effect for internal audit, audit committee and board of directors on earnings management was detected. However, the results revealed that there was a slight negative effect for internal audit scope of work and independence and audit committee independence on DAs. Research limitations implications - This research paper is applied on Saudi Arabia, a Middle East country with specific characteristics, that is, a specific context, and, therefore, the results must be interpreted within this context Practical implications - Regulators of Saudi corporations may need to reassess the effectiveness of corporate governance requirements issued by the Capital Market Authority and the actual implementation of these requirements. Researchers also may need further investigation of this phenomenon within its context. Social implications - The results of the study are very important to the Saudi society because they put a big question mark on the relevance of corporate governance of the Saudi shareholding companies Originality/value - The paper provides new evidence about the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on earnings management in a Middle East environment, which may suggest that there is a need to expand this study using other methodologies to delve into the depths and understand this phenomenon within its context.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

This paper explores the relationship between the ownership of public firms and their motivation to implement earnings management practices, providing evidence on whether family businesses differ from non-family businesses in terms of earnings management practices. In addition, it focuses on the possibility of asymmetrical earnings management policies between periods of stability and economic adversity. Based on a sample of Portuguese listed family-controlled firms for the 1999-2011 period and using a panel data approach, we find no significant differences in the incentive to manage earnings between public family and non-family firms, suggesting a compensation between the alignment hypothesis, the long-term orientation of family firms and the desire to pass firms onto succeeding generations, and the entrenchment effect. The evidence shows that earnings management decreases with firms' profitability, and non-family firms' discretionary accruals are mainly influenced by the board of directors. In crisis periods, the discretionary accruals of family firms are especially influenced by firm size. After controlling for different earnings management measures, the determinants of earnings management practices seem somewhat sensitive to the earnings quality proxies. The results provide evidence that directors and policy makers should prevent earnings management procedures in particular situations. (c) 2016 CPA Australia

Purpose: The purpose of this paper was first to find out whether the negative relationship between board size and future firm risk persists in China while contemplating all sorts of endogeneity. Second, the authors have investigated the role of large shareholders in influencing the managerial decisions concerning future firm risk via board size. Finally, the authors examined whether the moderating role of large shareholders is any different in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) in China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample included all the A-listed firms listed on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen stock exchanges over a sample period from 2008 to 2013. The authors used fixed effects regression and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size is negatively associated with future firm risk when measured as volatility in future stock prices and future cash flows. Second, large shareholders directly influence managerial decisions about future firm risk, irrespective of board size. Third, the moderating role of ownership concentration is insignificant in both SOEs and NSOEs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which has analyzed the role of large shareholders in the relationship between board size and future firm risk. This study provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of a developing country, into the role played by large shareholders in influencing managerial decisions concerning future firm risk.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the extent to which corporate governance (CG) systems adopted by Latin American listed firms affect their cost of equity capital. Several studies on the link between the two aforementioned dimensions have been carried out, but none in the context of Latin American firms. Design/methodology/approach: A CG index is created by taking into account the peculiarities of each country and the recommendations given by the corresponding CG institutes. In particular, to assess the level of CG quality, three sub-indexes have been identified: "Disclosure", "Board of Directors" and "Shareholder Rights, Ownership and Control Structure". Findings: The results indicate a negative relationship between CG quality and the cost of equity. In particular, the "Disclosure" component is the one mostly affecting the cost of equity. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the literature by adding knowledge on the relationship between CG and cost of capital considering, for the first time, the overall Latin American market. Practical implications: The paper proves that institutional investors all over the world are disposed to pay a premium to invest in firms with effective CG standards; moreover, this premium is higher in emerging countries such as those analyzed in this paper, rather than in developed countries. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper empirically investigating the relationship between CG and cost of capital in Latin America.

Manuscript type: Review Research Question/Issue: This article reviews how and through which channels corporate governance shapes takeover outcomes. Research Findings: We summarize the main findings of the empirical literature that investigates the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on takeover outcomes. The internal and external governance mechanisms that we consider are: the board of directors, the takeover market, blockholders, financial markets in general, product market competition, and the labor market. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This article adopts an agency perspective of the firm and reviews the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) literature through the lens of corporate governance. We highlight how the different corporate governance mechanisms affect the takeover process and outcomes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The article systematizes the current state of the research linking corporate governance and takeovers. In doing so, we emphasize which mechanisms policymakers can use to improve the efficiency of the takeover market. Alternatively, the review also offers indications concerning mechanisms that could be used to mitigate agency conflicts and, as such, increase firm value. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Based on previous studies, ownership structure is not standardized across different country and economic sectors. In other words, each country or economic sector might have different types of sustainable ownership structure that contribute to the competitive and healthiness of a firm. Failure to establish a sustainable ownership structure may produce a result that is contradicted from what is expected by the shareholders. This situation frames a picture that ownership structure is a vital determinant in enhancing firm performance. By highlighting the corporate governance components that normally used in the academic research, this study tends to identify the important components that applied in the reforms of the Malaysian corporate governance. This study is needed as a tool to proof whether the ownership structures and corporate governance practices are truly influenced firm performance. The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship between firms' ownership structures, corporate governance practices and firm performance. Specifically, this study narrows the ownership structures categories into; institutional, government, family, foreign, managerial and concentrated. Besides, this study focuses on ten corporate governance components which include board structure, CEO duality, board size, independent board of directors, directors' professionalism/qualification, board meeting, board committee, directors' remuneration, transparency and disclose, merger and acquisition. Firm performance will be measured in the aspect of accounting profitability-return on asset and return on equity; and market performance-Tobin-Q, price to earnings and price to book value. The participating firms of this study are non-financial public firms that are actively listed in the main market of Bursa Malaysia during the 5-year period (2010-2014). The sample will be tested and analyzed by using empirical quantitative method, linear regression, multiple regression and panel data regression analysis. (c) 2016, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Purpose: Boardroom's effectiveness has emerged as an issue of considerable importance in the minds of academics and practitioners, particularly in the aftermath of the highly visible corporate governance scandals of the past few decades. The purpose of this paper is to shed new lights on this topic by proposing a robust design framework for boardroom's effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: The interpretative investigation is based on semi-structured interviews administered to directors of Fortune 500 firms. The adopted thematic analysis is phenomenology, or the feelings, experiences and perceptions of events as depicted first hand by individuals with significant boardroom's experience. Findings: Two central findings could be construed from this investigation. First, the optimum boardroom's configuration is not a universal proposition. In other words, there are no magic recipes, and no one-size fits all approach. Rather, the optimum boardroom's configuration ought to be framed in light of the overarching needs of the firm in relation to the dynamic forces in the external environment. Second, the design of boardrooms ought to span beyond structural aspects (i.e. the outwardly visible aspects) to also encompass two largely unobserved boardroom's phenomena, namely, the directorship personal trait factors and the directorship behavioral patterns. Research limitations/implications: The findings presented herein may be contaminated with cognitive and personal biases, a common and unavoidable occurrence in qualitative research. A more integrative research approach using inductive and deductive techniques would allow for triangulation of results, thus providing an additional dose of validity and relevance to the research findings. Practical implications: There has been a growing disenchantment about the modus operandi of the board of directors among practitioners, particularly as it pertains to large corporations with diffuse and heterogeneous shareholders and stakeholders. New design guidelines for the board of directors would directly impact on corporate practices. Social implications: The design of high performance boardrooms is instrumental to shareholders, policymakers, directors, executives, rank and file employees, suppliers, customers and other direct and indirect stakeholders, as it may help avert future corporate governance mishaps. Originality/value: As of today, the academic and popular literature has yet to provide unequivocal guidance for the development of high performance boardrooms. This study fills an important gap in the prevailing corporate governance literature by integrating both structural and socio-cognitive factors into the design framework of the board of directors.

In countries with weak institutions, board governance becomes more important. This study uses a unique dataset from listed sub-Saharan African companies to examine the relationship between ownership composition and board compensation. It further analyses the association between board compensation and company performance. The findings indicate that board ownership and chief executive officer ownership are positively associated, whereas state ownership and concentrated ownership are negatively associated with board compensation. There is no evidence of a significant association between chairperson ownership or foreign ownership and board compensation. Finally, there is a negative but not significant relationship between board compensation and company performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study whether and how owners' preferences for CEO characteristics changed due to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The authors identify three fundamental success factors needed for companies to compete in the after-crisis environment, and the authors connect five CEO characteristics to such factors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors rely on a hand-collected database to build a panel data of European CEOs for the 2010-2012 period. Findings - The empirical results indicate that after 2009, CEOs of companies that were more severely hit by the crisis are significantly different compared to those of other companies. More specifically, they have a background in science or engineering; they have international experience; and they are remunerated to a higher extent through stock options. The results of this paper also indicate that only international experience had a positive and significant impact on financial performance. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the stream of literature on CEO characteristics and owners' identity, tackling the research theme from a dynamic rather than from a static perspective.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of corporate governance in companies and to delineate their effect from the perspective of two variables: the financial performance of firms; and an examination of executive turnover. An analysis on theoretical grounds of these two variables is made with respect to non-financial companies specifically in the context of the country of Jordan. Also in the context of this study, a company represents a firm. A sample comprising 109 companies from the non-financial sector for the fiscal year 2011 was selected and analyzed. A cross sectional study tested all hypotheses of the study and used statistical software, SPSS 20, to analyze the data. The study has examined the structure of the board of directors and its effects on the financial performance (financial leverage) of the non-financial Jordanian companies. Evidence suggests that the corporate governance mechanisms such as increasing the board size has a positive effect on reducing the level of financial leverage, thus leading to enhanced levels of financial performance. On the other hand, board independence and the structure of non CEOduality have no effect on a company's financial performance. In addition, the findings revealed that executive turnover has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between some of the factors and that is the board size and financial leverage. Given the diversity of trends utilized to measure the financial performance of companies in the area of corporate governance and the associated performance relationship, empirical research has continued to undergo new financial performance indicators to prevent manipulation and to obtain a realistic picture of the financial performance of companies. Hence, this is the first study that internationally chooses financial leverage to represent the financial performance of companies in their relationship with corporate governance. Crucially, it is globally the first study to choose executive turnover as a moderating variable on such a relationship. Thus, choosing these two new variables uniquely contributes to the literature of both corporate governance and firm performance from the perspective of developed and developing countries. This is considered to extend and add new insights to prior research in this discipline. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to policy-makers, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties in the Middle East; specifically in Jordan.

This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and 'increased career risks' perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country's culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

As the economy is recovering from the recent financial crisis, we explore the appropriateness of a corporate monitoring organ, which is a component separate from the board of directors, to enhance firm-specific information disclosure. Findings of this study, rooted in the evidence from China's stock markets, confirm that having a separate and effective monitoring organ results in a higher level of idiosyncratic risk, as long as the legal environment is sufficiently strong and the functionality of this separate monitoring organ is clearly defined. Effects of regulatory changes and ownership characteristics are addressed to help better understand the corporate governance-idiosyncratic risk relationship. Moreover, this study sheds light on timely global issues about information transparency and supervision, the lack of which becomes one of the major causes of the ongoing financial crisis, and presents an important challenge before corporate governance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between family ownership and the performance of Brazilian companies listed on BM&FBovespa. It also provides a comparison with the results of Shyu's (2011) survey conducted in Taiwanese companies. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 187 Brazilian companies were surveyed, of which 120 were classified as family owned, considering the family participation in the capital and in the board of directors. As in Shyu's (2011) study, three variables of performance, two of accounting and one of market, and seven variables of control were considered. Simultaneous equations were used to analyze the relationship between family participation and corporate performance, the test of mean was used to compare performance and other variables between family- and non-family-owned companies, and a graphical analysis was used to verify the extent to which family involvement contributes to better performance. Findings: The results show that family-owned companies have lower performance compared with non-family-owned companies. They indicate a positive relationship between family participation (ownership) and performance of the company. They also reveal that the performance of family-owned companies is maximized when family involvement reaches 60 and 70 percent. Originality/value: The survey conducted on Brazilian companies shows results that are partially consistent with those observed by Shyu (2011) in Taiwanese companies. Similarities were found in the relationship between family involvement and the performance of the company. However, the results differ with regard to the performance of family- and non-family-owned companies and the optimal level of family participation that can maximize performance.

This paper investigates the link between the board composition and the corporate diversification decisions of 50 large UK listed corporations over the period from 2005 to 2015. The panel data analysis integrates changes in board composition and its dynamic effect on the extent of diversification. We find that increased board independence influences the extent of both unrelated and related diversification. Neither institutional representatives nor extra-industry interlocking directors influence the extent of diversification in ways which promote shareholders' interests. The findings support corporate governance policy promoting board independence. In contrast, these findings suggest extending the involvement of institutional investors to board representation may not mitigate agency problems in large companies.

In the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997/1998, the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) issued the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2000 (MCCG 2000). It was subsequently revised in 2007 following the Enron and Transmile debacles. In 2012, the SC issued the latest MCCG 2012 which introduced several new recommendations that are in line with developments in other parts of the world. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the structure of the board and its activities on firm performance post MCCG 2007. The study also aims to shed light on the effectiveness of the board of directors since the issuance of MCCG 2000 and of MCCG 2007. It also aims to reveal the preparedness of listed firms in Malaysia to embrace MCCG 2012. Using a population of non-finance listed firms for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 financial years, it was found that board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, directors' busyness, nomination committee independence, the establishment of a risk management committee (RMC) and board meetings are not associated with firm performance, i.e. Tobin's q. However, the market appears to be in favour of a larger board size. As for return on assets (ROA), it is not associated with board independence, board size, directors' busyness and nomination committee independence. On the other hand CEO duality and the establishment of a RMC improve ROA, while board meetings are detrimental to ROA. It can therefore be concluded that board independence is not associated with either Tobin's q or ROA. Hence, any corporate governance reforms should not over-emphasize the representation of independent directors on the board, rather the focus might be shifted to board activities, such as board meetings and the establishment of a RMC. With regard to board size, since the market is in favour of a larger board size, firms should increase the board's size to enable the appointment of women directors to the board. Finally, combining the CEO and board chairman roles should not be disallowed as the market views this favourably. Hence, the 'one-hat approach' does not appear to be applicable in the case of CEO duality. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we examine the impact of corporate governance on the performance of externally managed real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Singapore (S-REITs) from 2008 to 2012 using the Corporate Governance Index (CGI) developed by the Asia Pacific Real Estate Association (APREA). We employ the generalized method of moments (GMM) method, which is more robust compared to previous studies that used pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and panel data. The results indicate that corporate governance has a significant impact on return on assets (ROA) and excess returns of S-REITs even though S-REITs are in a highly regulated industry. The results further indicate that individual corporate governance influences and affects the value of S-REITs. In addition, the findings also indicate that the S-REIT board of directors could mitigate and curtail related party transactions, which would have significant impact on the excess returns of S-REITs.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This article aimed to investigate whether corporate governance uses tax management to increase companies' performance. The objective was checking whether corporate governance characteristics, such as remuneration paid to the executive board, segregation between Chairman and CEO, and the independence and composition of the Board of Directors, influence tax management in Brazilian companies. At the same time, it aimed to identify whether the preceding tax management is reflected on the subsequent tax management. To do this, a sample of 355 Brazilian companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA between 2008 and 2014 was used, in order to find out whether their corporate governance characteristics influenced tax management, something identified by calculating ETR, CashETR, and BTD. As a result, it was found (i) that the remuneration paid to executives may be regarded as a characteristic influencing tax management in Brazilian firms, and (ii) that the preceding tax management influences the future tax management. In addition, it was found that Brazilian companies do not rule out tax management benefits, since the average effective rate in the sample under analysis was 25%, and it is statistically lower than the nominal rate of taxes on earnings in Brazil, which is 34%.

This paper investigates the relationship between the percentage of outside directors and financial performance in non-listed family firms while considering the generational effect. Using longitudinal data on 322 Lebanese firms covering the period 2008'2010, a regression analysis indicates that firm profitability depends upon the percentage of outside directors only in second and later generations. In first-generation family firms, the replacement of an inside director by an outsider has no significant impact on performance. In contrast, in the second and subsequent generations, outsiders can be used as an effective governance mechanism to reduce agency costs and thus enhance performance. Local entrepreneurs and regulators could build upon these results to implement better corporate governance practices in order to enrich the growth and prosperity of Lebanese family firms.

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of what makes boards effective. We analyse the relationships between board demography and company performance and between working structures and board tasks in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We test our hypotheses on a sample of 307 Spanish SMEs. The main empirical result is the negative impact that the proportion of outside directors and the board size have on firm performance. We also find a negative impact of outsiders' presence and a positive impact of director tenure on the board's service role. Our analysis of the role of board control highlights the negative relationship between this variable and CEO tenure.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

This chapter presents a basic characterisation of the Family Business Governance (FBG) system and its main mechanisms, such as family meetings, a family council, a family assembly, a family constitution and a board of directors/supervisory board. It indicates the key tasks of these mechanisms. The chapter examines the experience of young Polish family firms in developing their family governance structure as well as assessing its usefulness. In analysing governance present in the family company, it is important to remember that both the company and the family are subject to continuous evolution. In analysing the operation of the FBG system, it is necessary to remember that its subsystems family governance and corporate governance functioning on various levels differ in terms of their objectives and tasks. Analysis of the experiences of participants in research on representatives of two generations of owners of young family businesses disclosed that with respect to the building of FBG structure/mechanism systems.

Purpose: Asian economy in transition is facing great deal of challenges, so its corporate governance. This paper investigates the dominant corporate governance models practiced under the liberal market capitalism, cooperative capitalism, collective capitalism and the state capitalism across the continents and proposes conscious governance approach for Asia and emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores and compares Anglo-American and Continental European corporate governance models. The report further investigates the development of corporate governance across Asian publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, small and medium enterprises and other privately held large enterprises, and raises questions and concerns and derives conclusion. Findings: The Asian experience of imposing Western corporate governance models is more of a simplification of tasks based on political, cultural and globalization needs rather than the regions' economic, financial and social development reality. Practical implications: The unique proposition of conscious corporate governance aligns corporate governance practice with Asian socio-economic transition vision and helps with further development and reforms. Originality/value: The paper adds to the existing efforts and triggers a fresh view to the Asian and emerging economies corporate governance research and strategy.

The presence of key institutional investors/owners and BOD characteristics as highlighted by Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may have influence on the yield to maturity (YTM) of bonds and sukuk. It is argued that higher institutional ownerships will produce enhanced active monitoring on cost of debt and presumably more control on the likelihood of default risk occurrence as measured by the size of yield spreads for conventional bonds and sukuk. Agency theory also explains the relationship between principal and agent and the possible misalignment of interest of both parties is reflected through the incurrence of what is termed as agency cost. To reduce this agency cost requires the necessity of incurrence of cost of monitoring and controlling by the principal which in large firms is represented by institutional investors which delegated this responsibility to the appointed board of directors (BOD). Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these corporate governance mechanisms with respect to institutional investors and BOD characteristics with the default risk as proxy by yield spread of bond and sukuk in Malaysia. The data are obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, Bondinfo Hub of Malaysian Central Bank, Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014. Unbalanced panel data are applied for the tests which cover the pooled ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models. The results suggest that the presence of institutional ownerships does have an inverse relationship on the default risk for long-term sukuk. However, the results do not support any relationship between institutional ownerships and long-term conventional bonds defaults. Mixed result reveal by BOD characteristics.

Our study is based on the "Agency Theory", as it interprets the relationship between corporate governance and market capitalization of firms listed in Bahrain Bourse (BB). Longitudinal data is used in this study from 36 listed firms in Bahrain Bourse during the period of 2009-2013. A set of econometric methods, including the fixed effects method, is used to overcome different measurement problems of such relationship. The study findings include a set of results that are related to effect of ownership structure and board of directors' characteristics on market capitalization of firms. Based on these findings, a set of recommendations, along with study limitations and future research, are put forward. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

This research aimed at analyzing the influence of the size of the board of directors, the composition of the independent commissioners, the effectiveness of audit committee and government ownership of the financial reporting quality and its implications on the financial performance of state-owned enterprises. Research population is state-owned enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010-2014. There were 50 companies assigned as the sample of this research by using purposive sampling method. The results showed that partially, the size of the board of director, the composition of the independent commissioners and government ownership did not have the significant influence on financial reporting quality. The effectiveness of audit committee positively and significantly influenced financial reporting quality. The size of the board of directors, the effectiveness of the audit committee and financial reporting quality positively and significantly influenced financial performance. The composition of an independent commissioner and government ownership negatively and significantly influenced financial performance. (c) 2017, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to contribute to the corporate governance literature by examining the effects of board governance and ownership structure on financing decisions in an emerging country context. Using hand collected corporate governance data from a panel sample of 110 publically-listed firms in Bangladesh over 2009-2012, this study finds that the corporate debt ratio is not related to standard board of directors mechanisms.The results indicate that board of directors play little role in resolving conflicts in an environment with the presence of strong principal-principal agency conflict. The study also finds no evidence of institutional investors' activism in a manner that is consistent with the goals of other outside stockholders due to the weak regulatory and market discipline. This empirical evidence from the principal-principal agency conflicts (conflict of interest between majority shareholders and minority shareholders) offers insights to policy makers in emerging countries interested to protect minority shareholders' rights and to ensure effective corporate governance of capital structure decisions.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The importance of corporate governance practice is to ensure investor protection and oversight. Corporate governance is applied not only in public companies but also applied in the ordinary course of business enterprise. This study examined the characteristics of board governance as measured by the independence of the board of commissioners (independent BOD), board size, managerial ownership, board composition, the audit committee, on the implementation of corporate governance as measured through the company's financial performance measured by ROA (Return on Asset), ROE (return on Equity), and PER (Price Earning Ratio). The aim of this study was to obtain an overview of the features of board governance in public companies in Indonesia; particularly in fortifying the role of the board of commissioners in executing corporate governance. The population in this study was all of the non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) during the period from 2005 to 2013. Cross-tab analysis and regression analysis were utilized to analyze the data used in the study. The results of the cross-tab analysis indicate that the number of independent commissioners within a company is positively correlated to the number of commissioners. Furthermore, the results for cross-tab analysis between independent BOD and managerial ownership suggests that the higher the number of independent commissioners, the lower percentage of managerial stockholding in the company. In regression analysis, the variables independent BOD, board size, audit committee and managerial ownership are positively significant to company's performance measured by ROA and ROE. However, all of the previously mentioned variables are not significant to PER. Independent commissioners play a vital role, especially in regard to the financial performance measured with ROA and ROE.

In modern economies, the corporate governance principles have been understood as drivers that mitigate the risk derived from the existing gap between managerial practices and ownership structure. This research contributes to the literature review, analyzing the relationship between the board characteristics, audit firms, and a set of indicators taken as proxies of performance. Based on a dataset of 124 non-financial companies, a linear model was regressed. We found that some characteristics of board of directors significantly influence the companies' performance. These new insights can also provide new guidelines for policy makers towards the establishment of new common rules and principles that accurately grant the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms and ensure the desired international comparability.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

ABSTRACT: We use a dataset comprising the appointments of commercial bankers as board of directors at Chinese listed firms and find that financially distressed firms are more likely to recruit a commercial banker as a director of the board. The presence of a banker on the board increases access to bank loans, yet many investors react negatively to announcements of such appointments. We also find that such appointments are typically followed by a drop in the appointing firm's operating performance, and an increase in rent-seeking activities. This suggests that bank directors cannot strengthen corporate governance. Most financial resources are expropriated by corporate insiders. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We study the role of target insurer boards and the post-acquisition retention of target directors in U.S. life insurer mergers and acquisitions. Our results indicate that board characteristics affect the likelihood of acquisition. Smaller boards, boards with better reputations and boards without CEO dominance are more likely to agree to acquisition. Boards with a larger proportion of outside directors are less likely to agree to acquisition, especially when firms perform well. In terms of post-acquisition director retention, we find that outside directors are more likely to lose their seats after acquisition, especially when firms underperform. Directors holding more directorships in other firms or having experience as top management are more likely to be retained. Outside directors are less likely to be retained if they are from a firm with CEO duality, and inside directors are more likely to be replaced if the takeover is disciplinary.

The purpose of corporate governance mechanisms is to prevent opportunistic behaviour by managers, in order to align the interests of owners and managers. Following from this, our research topic is the analysis of ownership concentration as an internal mechanism to protect the interests of shareholders. In the study of the interdependence between ownership concentration and shareholder protection, particular importance needs to be given to the relationship between ownership structure, the role of the board, and strategic decision-making. Starting from this interdependence, our research aim is to examine the impact of ownership concentration on the protection of shareholders' interests and the board's responsibility for firm strategy. This paper presents the results of an empirical, pilot study in the Republic of Serbia. The research confirms the interdependence of corporate governance mechanisms and strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that ownership concentration protects majority shareholder interests and leads to lower board responsibility for strategic decision-making.

Literature has devoted limited attention to going public process of family business and, to date, there is no evidence of what the drivers for IPO survival of such firms could be. In the setting of listed companies, the composition of a board of directors is critical when the health and effectiveness of firms are at issue. The aim of the article is to analyse if board structure of publicly listed family firms affects their survivability on the capital market after IPO. We develop testable hypotheses regarding the structure of the board of directors in terms of (a) the presence of family members; (b) the presence of independent directors; (c) the role of the founder as chairperson. The results are robust to logistic regression and Cox hazard model and they show a curvilinear relationship between the ratio of family members in the board of directors and the likelihood of post-IPO delisting and a positive linear relationship between the ratio of independent directors in the board and the likelihood of post- IPO delisting. Both the relationships are moderated in negative way by the founder chairperson. (c) 2016 IABE.

In the last decade performance evaluation of the Board of Directors has become a best practice at national and international level. Italy is an interesting area of analysis given the high concentration of ownership that characterizes companies, including listed companies. In this context the choices of governance that affect the level of disclosure, for which the expectation is to have a low level of disclosure on the practice of BE (Board Evaluation).The first purpose of this paper is to present a resume on the state of the art in terms of BE for Italian listed companies at 31st December 2012, in terms of presence/absence of the practice of disclosure and its more or less extensive disclosure. The second objective is to highlight the modality of adoption of BE and the third is to analyze the relationship between the quality of BE (measured using as a proxy the disclosure on its setting up) and corporate governance. The results reveal there are few companies that use board evaluation and that there is a relationship between BE adoption and good governance and between the quality of BE and good governance.

In recent years, several events came to light regarding major business failures such as Enron Corporation, Dynergy, Tyco, Rite Aide, and Worldcom; most of the multinational companies (MNCs), including the ones working and operating in the developing countries, especially in the Gulf region, have recently been forced to ensure that goals of the management of the corporation are in line with the goals of the other major stakeholders through efficient corporate governance systems. In general, corporate governance systems vary all over the world; therefore, it is almost impossible to find one corporate governance system that fits all countries (Cruz 2006). For example, if the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Kuwait adopts the American model, how will this affect the financial and nonfinancial performance of Saudi's, Qatar's, or Bahrani's owned companies? And what is the best practice of corporate governance systems that would better align the interests of the board of directors and management with the interest of long-term stockholders in the Gulf countries?.

The recent restructuring of the economy has led to the fact that the leaders of information technology sector - Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon - became the largest companies in the world, replacing the banking and oil and gas sectors. The emergence of a large number of technology start-ups resulted in the increase of the entrepreneurial ownership. Business founders tend to issue dual class stocks to retain control over key corporate decisions. The capital structure and the Board of Directors structure alter along with changes in the ownership structure. In many large companies, more than 90% of directors have become independent. At the same time, the diversification of the board of directors is improving by the active involvement of women in decisionmaking processes. Zero debt popularity reflect the changes in the attitude to risk. The article examines the main trends in the ownership structure of the largest US companies. The research consolidates the results of theoretical and empirical research in the field of corporate governance, capital structure and ownership structure in the developed markets. We provide the analysis of the dispersed ownership as the element of Anglo- Saxon corporate governance model based on historical trends in the ownership structure of companies in the US. The appearance of new sectors, the rapid development of entrepreneurial ownership, the return of the popularity of dual class shares, the fashion for gender diversification in the board of directors and the phenomenon of zero debt level are illustrated by case studies of actual corporations and analytical reports. We discuss all of the identified trends in terms of risk. In order to hedge the higher business risks of new sectors the top management and investors reduce debt, invite women to the board of directors and increase the degree of independence of the board of directors.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

This study provides an inter-country comparison of how well boards of directors design policies against corruption and bribery. Using a sample of firms from 12 countries, we find that the higher presence of independent directors on the board is associated with the implementation of policies on corruption and bribery that regulate these practices in all the companies that form the group as well as in their intermediates overseas. We also find significant differences in the effectiveness of independent directors in constraining unethical managerial behaviour between high and low investor protection countries.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

The common principles of corporate governance in the world often recommend a board of directors be composed of independent members. The key mission for the independent members of the board of directors is to make sure of this substantial matter that the conflict on agency among the shareholders and management must be candidly solved; this requires the proper evaluation of the balance between risks and rewards, short-term benefits versus long-term benefits and the conflict of interests. Therefore, the independent members of the board of directors should be not only qualified but also conscious enough in order to be able to ensure of the stability of the company and resolve it. In addition to that, this should not be done with interference in the tasks of the executive management but it should be accomplished indirectly in order to make sure of the fact that the management of the company would decide and fulfill the required measures based on that awareness. The objective of this research is to study the effects of the corporate governance mechanisms (board of directors' independence) on the risk in the companies listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange. For that aim, 80 companies enacting in the Tehran Stock Exchange were selected as the statistical samples in the time period 2010-2014 by the removal method and the data was analyzed. The present study is practical in terms of objectives and it is a descriptive-correlation research. The statistical method applied for testing the hypotheses is the multivariate regression.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the empirical link between corporate governance and financial performance on a sample of 51 companies mostly from the technology sector and NASDAQ listed, during 2010-2013. Performance was measured using as proxy the return on assets (ROA) and the return on equity (ROE) and for the corporate governance measures there were selected variables as duality, seniority and remuneration of the CEO, size, independence and gender diversity related to Boards of Directors. As estimation techniques we used multivariate regression models, generalized least squares (GLS) and standard error correction for heteroskedasticity using White's method. The empirical results have confirmed the influence of mixed corporate governance variables on financial performance indicators at the company level. Hence, we obtained in both models a positive influence on financial performance from variables age, years listing and CEO's remuneration with bonuses. We obtained negative influence for the variables size / independent members of the Board of Directors and for the CEO duality. The difference between the two models was marked by the positive influence of the percentage of womens in Board of Directors' members and the CEO salary on ROA. The control variables had a positive influence only on the ROE model. The Risk Commitee variable had a negative influence on ROE. The paper highlights issues related to human nature such as the lack of fear for penalty which can lead to the loss of use of rationality and morality, a fact which leads to dangerous behavior if that people have a significant decision-making power.

Much research has suggested that independent boards of directors are more effective in reducing agency costs and improving firm governance. How they influence innovation is less clear. Relying on regulatory changes, we show that firms that transition to independent boards focus on more crowded and familiar areas of technology. They patent and claim more and receive more total future citations to their patents. However, the citation increase comes mainly from incremental patents in the middle of the citation distribution; the numbers of uncited and highly cited patents--arguably associated with riskier innovation strategies--do not change significantly.

Prior research finds that firms hire directors for their acquisition experience, regardless of acquisition quality (whether their prior acquisitions earned positive or negative announcement returns). Using several short- and long-run measures, we examine the effects of directors' acquisition experience on the acquisition performance of firms hiring them. We find that board acquisition experience is positively related to subsequent acquisition performance, demonstrating that firms appropriately value experience. Beyond experience itself, however, the quality of directors' prior acquisitions is also important. Our results suggest that firms may be better served to select directors based upon both past acquisition experience and acquisition performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Research summary: Does the degree to which founders keep control of their startups affect company value? I argue that founders face a "control dilemma" in which a startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between the startup's value and the founder's ability to retain control of decision making. I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0 percent. Managerial summary: A founder's vision and capabilities are key ingredients in the early success of a startup. During those early days, it is natural for the founder to have a powerful, central role. However, as the startup grows, founders who keep too much control of the startup and its most important decisions can harm the value of the startup. Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analyses of more than 6,000 private companies highlight that startups in which the founder has maintained control (by retaining a majority of the board of directors and/or by remaining as CEO) have significantly lower valuations than those where the founder has relinquished control. This is especially true when the startup is three years old or more. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in Italy, where the recently enforced Law 120/2011 prescribes gender quotas for boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity-firm financial performance relationship in an unbalanced panel of 918 Italian listed companies during the years 2011-2014. Findings: Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin's Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that board gender diversity is not a simple "numbers game", greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards and Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors. Originality/value: Most articles on this topic use data from countries with a legal system based on common law; this paper analyses Italy, a country with a civil law system. This is almost certainly the first study to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in the Italian market. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper presents an empirical study of changes that firms implement in their board-level IT governance (ITG) upon experiencing operational IT failures. Consistent with the separation of oversight from management decisions, board-level ITG is responsible for monitoring managerial IT decisions and policies for controlling IT resources. We expect that operational IT failures indicating inadequacies in board monitoring of controls over IT resources would result in a negative stock market reaction and, in turn, induce firms to improve their board-level ITG. Our expectation is confirmed based on a sample of 110 operational IT failures from U.S. public financial firms. Specifically, our results demonstrate that subsequent to experiencing operational IT failures, firms make improvements to the IT competency level of their boards, and the improvements are proportional to the degree of negative market reaction. However, those improvements are only on the executive side of the board, namely: an increase in the IT experience of internal (executive) directors and an increased turnover rate of CIOs serving on the board. Furthermore, the likelihood of CIO turnover is lower in IT-intensive firms where such turnover could be more disruptive. Our results contribute to understanding the critical connection between operational IT failures and board-level ITG.

This study examines the impact of board of director gender diversity on corporate tax aggressiveness. Based on a sample of 418 U.S. firms covering the 2006-2009 period (1672 firm-year observations), our ordinary least squares regression results show a negative and statistically significant association between female representation on the board and tax aggressiveness after controlling for endogeneity. Our results are consistent across several measures of tax aggressiveness and additional robustness checks. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether gender diversity on board and financial expertise on audit committee affect accounting conservatism in banking sector. Additionally, the authors focus on the effects of board characteristics on bank earnings quality and examine their effects on earnings persistence. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a large sample of 159 banks from nine different countries from the period 2004-2010. The authors study whether the differences in the timeliness of earnings to bad news and earnings quality across governance structures of banks are driven by differences across investor protection and bank regulation levels in banks. Findings: The findings confirm the monitoring role of both female and financial experts, noting a positive effect of them on accounting conservatism and earnings quality in banks. According to the institutional characteristics, the results suggest the complementary role of banking regulation and investor protection levels in these effects, noting that in contexts of higher regulatory and greater investor protection environments, gender diversity and financial expertise on boards have more influence on the conservatism and earnings quality of banks. Originality/value: The authors contribute to both the accounting quality literature and the corporate governance literature by identifying board characteristics that are associated with higher conservatism and quality of earnings in banks around the world. In addition, this study also contributes to the ethics literature by highlighting the benefits of gender diversity and financial expertise in upholding the integrity of financial reporting. Moreover, this paper adds to prior literature about board of directors and accounting quality by identifying additional complementary factors - bank regulation and investor protection - and by focusing on a specific industry, the banking industry.

This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature about the link between board characteristics and the level of social responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008-2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

This paper examines the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on companies' decision to assure their sustainability reports and their choice of assurance provider in countries with a greater stakeholder orientation. The corporate governance factors analyzed are related to the strength of the board's monitoring function, which is determined by the size, independence and activity of the sustainability committee. The international sample consists of 610 companies operating in countries that are more stakeholder oriented from the period 2007-2014. We propose alternative logit models of analysis using the random effects estimator. Consistently with our propositions, our results provide evidence that a firm's sustainability assurance and its choice of the accounting profession are positively associated with board independence and the activity of the sustainability committee. In addition, the empirical evidence obtained shows a U-shaped relationship between the board size and assurance issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance implications of board size, composition and frequency of board meetings on the performance of banks. Design/methodology/approach: The performance of banks is assessed on various parameters such as return on assets (ROA), Tobin's Q, non-performing asset ratio (NPA ratio) and the net write-off ratio (NWO ratio). The effects of changes in board size and composition and frequency of meetings on the performance of banks are investigated using feasible generalized least square (FGLS) estimation of panel data covering a time span of five years concerning 40 banks incorporated in India. Frequency of board meetings is taken as a proxy for board activity and involvement. The authors have also tested for endogeneity issues in the model. Findings: A curvilinear relationship was found between the board size and performance of banks. The authors have modelled a cubic form of the relationship for Indian banks. The authors' findings indicate that an increase in board size is associated with better bank performance within both low and high board size ranges. Alternatively, increased board size is negatively associated with bank performance in the intermediate board size range. The study did not find any significant relationship between performance and frequency of board meetings and board composition. Research limitations/implications: The behavioural variables reflecting the involvement of the board have not been incorporated in the model to determine the impact of board involvement on the performance of banks owing to the availability of data. It is hoped that this paper will be useful for major regulatory bodies such as the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Company Law Board (CLB) and stock exchanges in India and other emerging economies in devising listing norms and other governance-related aspects. Originality/value: Non-linear relationships between the board size and performance are not normally prevalent in emerging economies, especially in the banking sector. However, such a relationship exists among the Indian banks. This paper is the first of its kind to identify and address the same. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

We link genetic diversity in the country of origin of the firms' board members with corporate performance via board members' nationality. We hypothesize that our approach captures deep-rooted differences in cultural, institutional, social, psychological, physiological, and other traits that cannot be captured by other recently measured indices of diversity. Using a panel of firms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we find that adding board directors from countries with different levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases firm performance. This effect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, firm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use-as instrumental variables for our diversity indices-the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors' country of nationality.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

This research examines the relationship between independent directors, the audit committee (AC), and firm performance, taking into account the impact of the chief executive officer's powers and block shareholders. We use the maximum likelihood estimator, based on agency theory assumptions and cylindered panel data, to examine three models of firm performance. The results show that the independence of the board is reflected clearly by increased economic and equity performance of the firm. However, an AC that is fully independent or meets frequently is associated with lower firm performance. Unlike pension funds, institutional shareholders can be considered an effective control mechanism in the context of France. Our results development includes advanced explanations for market liquidity and shareholders' portfolios. The study period ends before the European regulation on ACs came into effect in 2008. This allows for an appreciation of soft law in French corporate governance. It also lets us compare the data with the way firms operate their boards one decade later. The evidence provides useful guidelines on the supremacy of soft law in corporate governance and suggests that the composition and functioning of the board of directors should be moderated based on the firms' context. The specificity of the cylindered panel data helps to better examine the impact of the board and AC's independence and functioning in French corporate governance structure.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between women in the board of directors, firm performance and corporate decisions as well as the risk of the firm, debt level, and research and development (R&D). Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates a sample of 41 Italian listed companies. In particular, using a panel data of 369 firm-year observations, during the period 2005-2013, through a generalized method of moment, the relationship between women in the board of directors and corporate decisions has been investigated. Findings: The results suggest that female representation in the board of directors affects corporate decisions. Women in the boardroom affect both financing and investment decisions. In particular, the presence of women seems to take on a complementary role to debt; it has a negative effect on risk and appears to have a positive impact on investment in R&D The results also suggest a strong relationship between female directors and firm value, especially when certain multicultural factors are considered. Finally, considering the concept of "critical mass," in line with the arguments of Kanter (1977), the results seem to emphasize a greater influence of women with respect to corporate decisions, moving from "tokenism" to a "critical mass" scenario. Practical implications: The outcomes of the application, besides improving the current knowledge on the relationship between female representation in the board of directors, innovation, financial, and accounting decisions, intend to reveal if the governance of Italian listed companies is efficient in determining company results and in pursuing optimal decisions. Moreover, the results could be useful for both policy makers for the regulation of corporate governance and the board of directors and as a suggestion to companies that regularly appoint the members of the board of directors. Originality/value: The work is not limited to examining the relationship between female representation and the performance of firms but instead uses a series of indicators of corporate decisions and multicultural, such as, the nationality of women in board of directors, the educational level, the past experience, and their interaction with the variables concerning the decision-making process. To the best knowledge of authors, this is the first study that investigates the relationship between women and corporate decisions in a single civil law country.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on earnings management practice for a sample of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Islamic banks (IBs) using a new model of earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors estimate discretionary accruals based on loan loss provisions discretionary loan loss provision (DLLP) using the procedure derived from Jones' (1991) original model. Second, the authors run a multivariate regression model to check the linkage between corporate governance characteristics and discretionary loan loss provision. Finally, the authors use an additional sensitivity check analysis to assess whether the results are robust to the estimation procedure and to other exogenous factors. Findings: Using as sample of 26 IBs pertaining to the GCC region with a total of 223 firm-year observations and a nine-year period (2004-2012), the results are conclusive and show that first, IBs with large Shariah Board size manage less DLLP. Secondly, Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions membership positively impacts earnings management through DLLP in IBs. Third, there is a negative relationship between boards of director's independence the extent to which IBs manage DLLP. Fourth, the existence of block holders positively affects earnings management by IBs. Fifth, there is a negative relationship between audit committee meetings and DLLP. Finally, institutional ownership and bank size have no effect on earnings management through DLLPs. Research limitations/implications: In this research, the authors do not take into account all governance factors that are supposed to impact earnings management in IBs. Future research should explore the impact of additional IBs governance structures including chief executive officer bonus, experience, gender and the extent to which IBs use real earnings management with Murabaha, Mudaraba and Musharaka transactions. Practical implications: The paper is a very useful source of information that may provide relevant guidelines in helping the future development of corporate governance of IBs. In addition, the findings could prove to be useful for regulators because they are responsible for the acceptable level of corporate governance standards. Thus, they must consider strengthening governance mechanisms either through new legislation or stronger enforcement where earnings management is of such magnitude to that serious impedes information transparency and financial reporting quality of IBs. Originality/value: This study associates the corporate governance characteristics with earnings management by IBs. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on earnings management and corporate governance in IBs. It should be useful to researchers, regulators, investors, analysts and creditors as well as other players in the capital markets, as it presents a new and important aspect that needs to be accounted for when assessing the quality of IBs' accounting information in GCC countries.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

This study explores whether the political connections of the board of directors facilitate credit financing. It addresses the gap concerning the discussion of the substitution or complementary effect on financing terms between political connections and government regulation in China. Using a data set covering 1340 private listed firms, we classify all members on the board of directors into subgroups and show that it is the political connections of nonexecutive directors, rather than executive directors that play an important role in obtaining long-term credit loans. Moreover, the convenience of obtaining financing is mainly derived from the political connections of official independent directors. (c) 2018 AFAANZ

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Failures in governance, especially in regard to boards of directors, have been blamed for the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The increased public scrutiny regarding the actions and role of the board of directors in banks, following the crisis, inspires to examine whether and to what extent the characteristics of banks' boards influence their performance in the crisis. Using a sample of 72 publicly listed European banks, we find that banks with more independent and busy boards experienced worse stock returns during the crisis. Conversely, the better-performing banks had more banking experts serving as supervisory directors. Additionally, we find that gender and age diversity improved banks' performance during the crisis; hence, diversity matters. We also construct a governance quality index on the basis of board characteristics and conclude that governance quality positively affects banks' returns during the crisis. Overall, we find evidence that banks' performance during the financial crisis is a function of their boards' characteristics. (c) 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the relationship between ownership structure and financial performance in the five major European football leagues from 2007-2008 to 2012-2013 and examine the impact of the financial fair play (FFP) regulation. Design/methodology/approach: The sample used comprises 94 teams that participated in the major European competitions: German Bundesliga, Ligue 1 of France, Spanish Liga, English Premier League and the Italian Serie A. The estimation technique used is panel-corrected standard errors. Findings: The results confirm an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between ownership structure and financial performance as a consequence of both monitoring and expropriation effects. Moreover, the results show that after FFP regulation, the monitoring effect disappears and only the expropriation effect remains. Research limitations/implications: The lack of transparency of the information provided by some teams has limited the sample size. Practical implications: One of the main issues that the various regulating bodies of the industry should address is the introduction of a code of good practice, not only for aspects related to the transparency of financial information but also to require greater transparency in the information concerning corporate governance. Social implications: Regulating bodies could also consider other additional control instruments based on corporate governance, such as for example, corporate governance practices, corporate governance codes, greater transparency, control of the boards of directors, etc. Originality/value: This study tries to provide direct evidence of the impact of large majority investors in the clubs and FFP regulation on the financial performance of football clubs.

A wealth of governance research has examined CEO successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. Despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. In this article, we investigate whether disruptive CEO successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. We focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. We leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are--in practice--viewed as normative violations. We theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim CEOs and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. However, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise CEO departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board's decision to rely on an interim CEO. Our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded U.S. firms provides support for these arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance.

This study investigates the behaviors of Chinese listed firms in using non-operating below-the-line items to manage earnings to meet rights-issuance threshold and to avoid delisting, and whether ownership structure and certain corporate governance mechanisms are related to such earnings management behaviors. The present empirical analyses document that the likelihood of managing earnings to meet these critical regulatory thresholds is negatively related to the adoption of independent directors in the board of directors and to the percentage shareholdings of the largest shareholders and positively related to the percentage share of state ownership in China. Further investigation documents that the relationship between earnings management and the fraction of independent directors in the board could be non-linear. There is little evidence, however, that board size, percentage shareholdings of CEO, the duality of CEO and top director of the board, the quality of external auditor, or foreign ownership is related to such earnings management measure. Using the distribution approach to detect earnings management, this study supplements the extant literature on the relationship between corporate governance, ownership structure and earnings management using traditional accrual-based measures. This study offers insights to policy makers, particularly those in emerging economies, about the inducement of earnings management behaviors by government regulations and the prescription to deter earnings management behaviors by encouraging certain internal corporate governance mechanisms.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Employing information on all publicly listed Indian banks covering the period 2003-2012, the study explores whether gender diversity impacts bank behaviour. The evidence suggests that the value addition to banks from the induction of women on their boards of directors is not compelling, although executive women directors enhance bank stability. Looking across ownership, the evidence suggests that gender diversity in state-owned banks enhances stability, but at the cost of lower profitability. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses the influence of ownership structure on the transparency of corporate social responsibility (CSR) information for a sample of 128 Spanish listed companies between 2009 and 2011. We distinguish two types of significant shareholders, depending on whether or not they are members of the board of directors. The results of the ordinary least squares regression show a different relationship between each type of shareholder and the transparency of CSR information. Significant shareholders who are not directors have a positive effect on transparency. Conversely, firms with boards holding more than 25% of ownership are less transparent than firms with boards holding below that threshold. Our results contribute to the academic debate on the relationship between ownership and CSR disclosure. They indicate the existence of information asymmetries between these two types of shareholders. Additionally, we contribute to literature on board of directors. We found that the presence of women on boards improves transparency, while the independence of the board and CEO duality do not affect it.

The present research study contributes to the extant literature on underpricing rather uniquely by addressing the under-researched linkage of corporate governance to underpricing. The originality of this effort also lies in being one of the initial efforts of exploring governance in context of initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in Indian settings. The study comprises an empirical analysis of 404 Indian IPOs studied for their board structures and ownership attributes using IPO prospectuses. Drawing support from the signalling theory, the variables board size and board committees exhibit a significant positive relationship to the IPO returns on the listing day. In Indian markets characterized by concentrated family-owned firms, promoter ownership does work as an effective signal for investors who take cues of firm potential from ownership patterns. Corporate governance measures have a miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing of Indian IPOs and indicating that investors do not incorporate these as a major consideration in their investment decision.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study explores the relationship between capital structure and corporate governance using a data panel of Spanish listed firms over the period 2005 to 2011. Specifically, two notable conflicts in the area of corporate governance have been analysed: (i) managerial ownership; and (ii) controlling shareholders ownership. Our findings confirm a non-monotonic relationship between both managerial ownership and ownership concentration, and capital structure. In order to mitigate endogeneity concerns, a number of robustness tests have been performed. The empirical evidence obtained yields a number of implications such as the shareholders' need to monitor entrenched managers, the insufficient protective legislation to prevent the expropriation of minority shareholders and the desirability of examining corporate governance factors in order to better understand a firm's financial policy.

The rise of accounting-related scandals has highlighted the prevalence of earnings management in financial markets. This paper offers empirical evidence on the motivations for earnings management in Malaysia public listed family firms. A sample of 100 family firms were randomly selected from Bursa Malaysia from the years 2010 to 2014, which resulted in 500 observations in total. The results indicate that the equity ownership held by a controlling family is associated with the earnings management in the firm, since the controlling family has greater power and rights in decision-making. However, the involvement of the controlling family as board of directors is not associated with earnings management in the family firm, since the non-executive member of the board will become the chairman to oversee and monitor the business operations of the family firm. The indirect ownership of the controlling family in family firms does not provide greater opportunity for them to manage earnings through direct equity shares held by other family members because they have limited power through indirect ownership.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether particular corporate governance mechanisms influence the performance of mergers and acquisitions. Design/methodology/approach: Regression analyses investigating 1,596 recent acquisitions in the US market completed over the five-year period from 2009 to 2013 are performed. Findings: The results show that board independency, CEO duality and level of CEO fixed compensation have an impact on the return of acquisitions. Moreover, the findings indicate that acquisitions significantly create value for bidders delivering a positive cumulative abnormal return upon announcement. Finally, also focusing on the 690 relative larger deals, there is a clear evidence of a positive influence of good corporate governance mechanisms over the quality of acquisitions completed. Originality/value: To our knowledge, this is the first paper trying to identify corporate governance mechanisms related to the best acquisition decisions, by using specifically the three corporate governance variables (CEO duality, CEO fixed compensation and board independency).

This article provides new evidence on the structure, dynamics and performance effects of corporate boards in publicly traded companies in Russia. It takes advantage of a new and unique longitudinal dataset of virtually all Russian companies whose shares were traded in the RTS/MICEX/MOEX over 1998-2014. The analysis highlights a number of strong trends in the evolution of boards of directors, such as a declining participation of insider directors and an increasing participation of foreign and female directors. It also shows that board characteristics are linked to company performance (market-to-book ratio, Tobin's Q, ROE and ROA), suggesting that boards of directors play a non-trivial role in corporate governance in Russia. Testing for structural breaks in the relationship between board composition and firm performance provides some evidence of the changing role of corporate boards over time. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We study the effect of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on corporate innovation. SOX dramatically changed corporate governance landscape of public firms in the U.S, especially in increasing monitoring from outside independent directors, which may have an impact on corporate innovation. The passage of SOX introduced an exogenous shock to the corporate governance structure, which enables us to establish causality between SOX and corporate innovation. Using patent and citation data from the NBER patent citation database, board of directors data from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and a difference-in-difference regression technique, we find that SOX increases corporate innovation, as measured by the number of patents and the number of citations per patent. Moreover, we find that the effects are stronger for firms facing more severe agency problems, i.e., firms with more entrenched CEOs as proxied by a longer tenure, and firms with low institutional ownerships. The effect is also found to be stronger for firms operating in innovative industries. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

This paper extends the corporate governance literature such as Alchian and Demsetz (1972) by analyzing the use of special committees of disinterested directors by target firms during corporate takeovers. Our sample spans post Sarbanes-Oxley from 2003 through 2007, under which boards of directors are subject to increased scrutiny and additional regulatory mandates. This period is also characterized by a high level of management buyout activity that can exacerbate conflicts. Our results show that special committee use is positively related to conflicts and negatively related to factors and situations where insider knowledge is particularly valuable. Moreover, the propensity to form a committee is negatively related to the board's overall independence; hence special committees substitute for the monitoring not found in the overall board composition. Special committees, on average, are formed well in advance of the merger agreement, employ additional financial advisors, and are more likely to run an auction process. Target returns in deals with special committees are no different than deals without special committees. The evidence indicates that special committees enable target boards to adapt to situational conflicts, which helps explain when independent directors matter for corporate governance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to ask the following question: is there a link between being politically connected, the quality of governance and the company's ownership structure? Design/methodology/approach: The author then examined Canadian companies from the S&P/TSX index for the year 2015. Findings: Political connectedness is significantly associated with lower quality of governance in relation to shareholders' rights; ownership concentration is associated with lower quality of governance in relation to the overall governance, board of directors, shareholders' rights and compensation structure indices; ownership structure does not mediate the relationship between political connections and quality of governance; and number of political connections through the executive is associated with less risky governance practices in relation to compensation structure; in other words, when members of the executive are politically connected, the firm adopts better compensation practices. Research limitations/implications: The time limitation is the main weakness of this study and probably the cause of observed mitigated results. Practical implications: The author hope that the results will inform regulators on the need not only to further regulate the business-politics relationship, but also to consider the specific traits of concentrated ownership companies and the most critical aspects of corporate governance in politically connected firms, such as shareholders' rights, particularly those of minority shareholders. For example, an intriguing case to investigate in the Canadian context would be Pierre Karl Peladeau's foray into Quebec politics and the controversy ignited by his political bid in light of his position as majority shareholder (75 percent) in communications giant Quebecor Inc. Social implications: In fact, the results shown that concentrated ownership firms have lower governance quality than non-concentrated ones. Furthermore, in a concentrated ownership context, the minority shareholders' rights could be threatened. In this sense, the results also shown that shareholders' rights seem to be the most critical governance issue for the politically connected Canadian firms. These results are therefore the indication that Canadian financial market regulators must take action about politically connected and concentrated ownership firms in order to further protect minority shareholders' rights. Originality/value: This study makes a double theoretical contribution by enriching the literature on corporate governance and by providing one of the first investigations into the direct and comprehensive relationships between political connections, governance and ownership structure.

This paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive-based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement. Compared to acquirers in the low equity-based compensation group, acquirers in the high equity-based compensation group outperform by 9.54% in a five-day period surrounding the announcement date. These results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues. We further find that acquirers with higher equity-based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions. An increase in director equity-based pay also results in a lower acquisition premium for targets. These results indicate that equity-based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our study reveals how two separate dimensions of board composition--the proportion of independent directors and of non-independent directors--influence CEO compensation in Western European firms. Controlling for the simultaneous determination of CEO pay structure and board design, we find that firms with a higher proportion of non-independent outsiders on their boards pay less direct compensation (salary + bonus) and less equity-linked compensation to their CEOs. By contrast, CEOs working for firms with more independent boards receive more equity based-pay. When we control for the fact that equity linked is not granted systematically in Europe we find that firms with more independent directors on the board tend to grant equity-linked compensation more often than firms with more non independent outside directors. Our results challenge the commonly accepted view of independent directors as safeguards of shareholder value, uncovering the relevance of non-independent outsiders for pay moderation and incentives.

This paper studies the advisory role of the board of directors in takeovers. I develop a model in which the takeover premium and the ability of the target board to resist the takeover are endogenous. The analysis relates the influence of the board on target shareholders and the reaction of the market to its recommendations to various characteristics of the acquirer and the target. I also show that the expected target shareholder value can decrease with the expertise of the board and it is maximized when the board is biased against the takeover. Generally, uninformative and ignored recommendations are not necessarily evidence that the target board has no influence on the outcome of the takeover. Perhaps surprisingly, under the optimal board structure, target shareholders ignore the recommendations of the board, which are never informative in equilibrium. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Do cooperative banks suffer from board deficiencies less frequently and severely than joint-stock banks? To answer this question, we analyze banks operating in Italy during the period 2006-2012 to examine whether the governing bodies of cooperative banks are less effective in carrying out their duties than those of joint-stock banks. Deficiencies in the governing body are measured by sanctions imposed by the supervisory authority. Research Findings/Insights: Findings revealed that the boards of directors of cooperative banks were sanctioned more often than board of directors of joint-stock banks. Furthermore, board turnover mediates the relationship between the cooperative status and board deficiencies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical evidence in support of the weakness of corporate governance in cooperative banks. Methodologically, our approach is novel in that we adopt a measure of board effectiveness/deficiency based on an independent third-party perspective (supervisory authority) that is not biased by the different objective function of the two types of banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings have several policy and managerial implications. We contribute to the ongoing debate on the proposal for flexible regulation of corporate governance for cooperative banks and emphasize that policy-makers and regulators should rethink the corporate governance structures of cooperative banks. In particular, the study reveals how board turnover should be carefully monitored to reduce board deficiencies at the bank level. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

We investigate the internal workings of US corporate governance with a hand-collected dataset of director resignations that are related to power struggles within the board. About two-thirds of the conflicts arise because of how board members interact in carrying out their duties, while most of the remaining cases involve disagreements between directors and top management over corporate strategy or financial policy. Conflicts are more likely to occur at companies where the CEO is the founder or is relatively new to the position. Tensions also increase when there are independent directors with large blockholdings. Stock prices decline sharply on average after a director turnover amid dispute, which may indicate that investors expect the firm to continue to have poor operating performance. The aftermath of such a resignation often includes shareholder class-action lawsuits, proxy contests, asset divestitures, and stock market delistings. Our results highlight the importance of a well-functioning board for reducing agency problems and maximizing shareholder value. (c) 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

Prior studies suggest that most expropriation of a firm's resources is conducted through the related party transactions. Based on the conflict of interest view, related parties opportunistically use their authorities to expropriate firms' resources for their own benefits. The aim of this study is to investigate the moderating effect of corporate governance characteristics on the relationship between RPTs and firm value. This study uses 'divergence' between cash flow and control rights as a new factor that could intensify the negative effect of RPTs. Findings of this study document that board size, CEO duality and divergence between cash flow and control rights can intensify the negative relationship between RPTs and firm value. Findings support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improving corporate governance practices.

Purpose: In light of frequent corporate scams and frauds, this paper aims to investigate the relationship of corporate illegality with the board of directors' characteristics in Indian manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: The board of director characteristics of sample companies charged with violation of the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations from 2008 to 2013 are matched to an equivalent-sized control data set. A cross-sectional logistic regression model is applied to test the hypothesized association. Findings: The findings suggest that the SEBI violations are less likely to occur when a large fraction of the board of directors consists of independent directors and when the individual directors have multiple appointments on the boards of other companies. However, it is observed that the size of the board and its meetings have no observable association with violation of the SEBI regulations. Research limitations/implications: This work is likely to aid future research in exploring the impact of governance mechanisms on the occurrence of illegality. In future, studies may be conducted to investigate the probability of illegal corporate events using a larger sample size and corporate governance variables which have not been examined in the present study. Practical implications: The analysis provides corporate policy makers and investors an insight to evaluate the vulnerability of a company being engaged in illegality based on its board features. Originality/value: The present study is distinct from previous reports as it makes a novel attempt to gauge the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the occurrence of illegality in the Indian corporate section.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of non-staggered voting for members of the board of directors on earnings quality and the value relevance of earnings and book value. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a sample of Taiwanese firms whose board was elected as a whole every three years from 2003 to 2013. The authors used multiple regression analysis to test whether board of directors elections and corporate governance affected earnings quality and the value relevance of earnings and book value. Findings: The authors found that elections led to lower earnings quality, but better corporate governance led to greater earnings quality. In the presence of board elections, earnings have reduced value relevance but book value had increased value relevance. Finally, given board elections, the relative value relevance of earnings and book value on stock price was not fully moderated by strong corporate governance. Research limitations/implications: The results presented here indicate the importance of better corporate governance in diffusing suspicions of management occasioned by the use of discretionary accruals in years in which board elections take place. Better corporate governance regimes led to a more positive relationship of discretionary accruals to earnings persistence, even in the presence of directorial elections. Similarly, better corporate governance regimes led to a more positive relationship between earnings per share and stock prices. Limitations include the restriction of the testing locale to Taiwan. That said, many companies around the globe use non-staggered board elections. Accordingly, these results suggest issues of importance to corporate governance advocates beyond Taiwan as well. Originality/value: This study deepens the field's understanding of the impact of corporate governance arrangements and schedules for electing board of directors' members on issues of interest to stockholders.

This paper examines the link between firm past performance and the appointment of new CEOs in the Indonesian publicly traded family-owned firms. Further, we also investigate the effect of family member composition in the board of directors and board of commissioners on the CEO succession. This study encompasses 148 succession events gathered from ORBIS database for the period of 2006-2015. Employing a logistic regression, results show that the appointment of new CEOs is generally affected by firm past performance and family member composition in the board of directors. Negative past performance would lead firms to select non-family member. Further, the more the number the family members sitting on the board of directors, the higher the probability family-owned firms to select the new CEO inside family member.

There has been a prominent stream of research investigating internationalisation of organisations. While the importance of transaction costs in the governance decisions of firms has been well established in the literature, transaction cost theory (TCT) in family firms remains underutilised. We examine the impact of family governance (i.e. family ownership and involvement in management and the board of directors) on internationalisation within the domain of TCT using 386 S&P 500 firms. Our findings indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between family ownership and internationalisation and a U-shaped relationship between family's involvement in management and the board and internationalisation. This illustrates the interesting differential impact of the components of family involvement on internationalisation. We conclude by discussing future research and implications for practice.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance is a natural consequence of globalization, which has led to financial globalization and globalization of municipal laws. Major changes have taken place in codification of rules regarding composition of board of directors and their duties. Disclosure norms both in final account statements and shareholding pattern have now become far more stringent in last two decades Foreign investments gradually led to adoption of corporate governance norms across the world. Relationship of firm valuation with enhanced corporate governance norms & foreign investment has been established in various studies; however relationship between corporate governance and firm performance has not been confirmed.

We examine the voluntary disclosure practices of family firms. Family firms have longer investment horizons and lower agency conflicts between owners and managers. However, they also exhibit higher agency conflicts between controlling and non-controlling shareholders, and greater concerns about their own reputations. We therefore hypothesize that the previously documented association between stock-based incentives and voluntary disclosures is dampened for family firms. In comparison to non-family firms, we find that family firms are less likely to provide management earnings forecasts when their CEO's wealth (linked to the firm) is higher. We note this influence only in larger firms, which is consistent with the finding that larger firms have a significantly higher number of stock-based incentives than smaller firms. Additionally, the main result continues to hold when a family member serves as CEO or on the board of directors. We contribute to the literature by extending the research on stock-based incentives and voluntary disclosure, linking this research to family firms, and providing insight on the conflicting results found in prior family firm research.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between a segmental disclosure policy and corporate governance structure within Canadian companies reporting under the Canadian accounting standard Section 1701, Segment Disclosure. Canadian firms subject to this standard are found to be reluctant to provide detailed disclosures of their activities and thus are complying with the minimum requirements using the grouping provision offered by the standard. We also found that except for the duality effect, the structure of the board of directors does not have a large effect on the chosen level of segmental disclosure. Furthermore, the ownership structure was found to influence the choice of the level of disclosure regarding the line of businesses data. This study is primarily motivated by the lack of Canadian evidence on the quality of segment disclosure. Moreover, this research is timely because of IASB"s current re-evaluation of segment reporting requirements. Therefore, the expected findings of this study may be of interest to standardsetting bodies in countries lacking effective regulation on segmental reporting, to accounting practitioners, and to users of financial statements.

This paper investigates how political connections affect firm performance. Different from prior studies, we enlarge the scope of political connections to include the board of directors in addition to large shareholders and top management. Besides, we also examine connection types, including connections through political parties, members of parliament, and government ministers. Using a sample of Taiwanese-listed firms from years 2005 to 2011, we find that politically-connected firms have lower accounting performance as well as lower market performance. Further analysis indicates that firms have weaker performance when they have higher proportions of directors serving as central government officers or legislative body representatives. The negative association is not affected by the director's level of professional knowledge and exists both before and after the financial crisis. The results are also consistent across different incentives (including future growth opportunities, financing needs, and tax avoidance) for politically-connected firms.

We test two competing theories that explain a firm's engagement in corporate diversity and employee benefits: socially responsible investment theory and management overinvestment theory. We find that publicly-traded companies with strong shareholder rights are more likely to promote women and/or minorities to the positions of CEO and board of directors in their organizations, conduct business with women- and/or minority-owned operations, and provide better family benefits to their employees than firms with strong management power. These findings indicate that the companies with strong shareholder rights engage more actively in internal aspects of CSR activities, which supports the socially responsible investment theory rather than the management overinvestment theory. Shareholders (i.e. institutional investors) tend to integrate their social goals (i.e. internal CSR issues) and financial goals into their investments. In response to these changes, managers should engage in the internal aspects of corporate social issues more aggressively as the agents of shareholders.

This study examined the influence of gender diversity among company boards of directors and managerial ownership on corporate risk-taking. The sample was manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2013 selected using the purposive sampling method. Data was examined using multiple regression methods. The results showed that gender diversity on a board of directors (BOD) and managerial ownership have no significant effect on corporate risk-taking. This is likely due to the relatively low percentage of both variables in Indonesia, thus, they do not tend to affect corporate risk-taking decisions. The study recommends increasing gender diversity and managerial ownership in the corporate risk-taking process towards sustainable business practices. (c) Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

This paper investigates whether corporate governance standard No. 3 that has been issued by Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB-3) has improved corporate governance structure of firms listed in the Kuwait stock market. In addition, the paper investigates whether the influence of IFSB-3 on corporate governance varies between Islamic and conventional financial institutions. We test two hypotheses using a sample of firms listed in Kuwait stock exchange over a period of 2000-2013. Ordinary least square regression and fixed effects estimation techniques are applied to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal all corporate governance measures indicate that the corporate governance has improved after the issuance of IFSB-3. The results also reveal that the improvement in corporate governance after the implementation of IFSB-3 is higher for Islamic than for conventional financial institutions. This suggests that IFAB-3 is more important for Islamic than conventional institutions. Accordingly, we conclude that corporate governance guideline (IFAB-3) has improved the corporate governance structure of firms listed in the Kuwait stock market. In this context, the study increases the awareness of standard setters, academics, investors, regulators, and many other stakeholders about the effect of IFAB-3 in the region. Finally, our study fills evident gap in the literature by investigating the influence of corporate governance guideline (IFSB-3) on corporate governance structure in a unique setting that is often ignored by accounting scholars, which helps to widen our knowledge on accounting practices across the globe.

This paper examines whether board function is associated with improved corporate performance. Path analysis is used to investigate the direct and indirect links between four performance variables and organization capital. A hypothesis is developed based upon the incorporation of knowledge-based resources. The idea is that the board of directors has monitoring and consultation functions, propelling organizational development. We use panel data with random effects for 1,355 firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2001 to 2012. The two-stage leastsquares method is used to explore the mediating effect among board function, organization capital and corporate performance. Both an aggregated model and the EP model are investigated specifying both a direct link and a mediated link with organization capital. It is concluded that the governance effect has a direct influence in the relationship between board function and corporate governance, and that organization capital is significantly associated with the performance variables. In terms of the counselling function of the board, inside directors are significantly related to dynamic capacity, which improves corporate performance for the long run.

This chapter examines the role of governance as a determining factor of foreign investors' decisions as for investing in Tunisian listed family firms. To achieve this goal, first, two distinct forms of family involvement in firms are studied: family ownership and family management. In addition, this research assesses the role of various indicators of family firm governance on foreign investors' decision to invest in Tunisian listed family firms: board of directors' independence, the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder and CEO duality. A sample of 27 firms listed in the Tunis stock exchange from 2007 to 2014 has been used. It is found, on the one hand, that foreign investors seem to avoid investing in firms with high family ownership as well as in those where the family is involved in management; on the other hand, the board of directors' characteristics as well as the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder do not affect the decisions of foreign investors in Tunisia.

The Livedoor-Fuji TV takeover battle for Nippon Broadcasting Systems is considered one of the greatest uproars in the corporate takeover in the history of Japan. The epic battle is believed to have its lasting impact on the basic institutions that govern the country's takeover market. The paper aims to investigate the institutional changes, if any, Japan has experienced following the Livedoor episode. Analysing a handful number of takeover attempts before and after the battle, the paper finds that although some surface changes can be observed, a broad-based change is yet to be seen. This can be attributed to the informal institutions which have long been recognised as fundamental building blocks of the national model of corporate governance in Japan.

Corporate governance is the relationship between the shareholders, directors, and management of a company, as defined by the corporate charter, by laws, formal policy, and internal audit; The relationship between corporate managers, directors, and the providers of equity, people, and institutions who save and invest their capital to earn a return. It ensures that the board of directors is accountable for the pursuit of corporate objectives and that the corporation itself conforms to the law and regulations. Corporate governance provides the framework for attaining a company's objectives: It encompasses practically every sphere of management, from action plans and internal controls to performance measurement and corporate disclosure.

One of the uniqueness of corporate sector in Malaysia is the existence of politically connected companies. Even though, there are few studies examine Malaysian politically connected companies but little is known about the characteristics of politically connected board members in Malaysian public listed companies. Thus, the purpose of this study is to extend other previous studies by examining the characteristics of politically connected boards, namely the position of the boards, age, ethnicity and gender. The results of this study provide better understanding related to politically connected boards to the Malaysian policy makers in formulating better policies about the politicians participation as the board of directors in Malaysian public listed companies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding of corporate governance (CG) in) in the banking sector. It is devoted specifically to explore CG mechanisms adopted by the Egyptian State-Owned Banks (SOBs), including CG regimes forced by the law (Board of Directors, Auditors, Audit Committee and Credit Committee) and other CG modes adopted voluntarily by these banks. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper demonstrates models of CG and the mechanisms used in the banking sector. An exploratory research used to conduct a detailed analysis of Egyptian state-owned banks' CG mechanisms provided by banks' annual reports of 205l16 and other materials. In addition to reviewing all available documentation materials, including Egyptian Central Bank' publications and related documentations highlighting CG in the banking sector such as the Law No.88 of 2003 and The code of CG in Egypt of 2010. The paper conducts few in-depth interviews with key contacts in the three banks on the compliance to CG standards. Use of multiple-informants, including archival data and in depth interviews helped in crosschecking relevant information and verifying the reliability of data. Findings: This paper reflects that most of the CG mechanisms used by banks are the ones imposed by laws and regulations, where they have a Board of Directors (BoD), an auditor and an audit committee. However, there are other committees voluntarily formed to improve CG, such as human resources committee, nomination and remuneration committees, and risk management committee. The board scope of power, the board full responsibility for CG, the board appointment by decree of Prime Minister after consulting with governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, and the board size and composition at SOBs in Egypt are increasingly adopting a more independent board of directors. The dominance of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) on board committees is also found to enhance the adoption of board independence and the effectiveness of CG. This paper suggests the importance of internal CG mechanisms vis-a-vis external norms in the banking sector. Research Limitations/Implications: The paper presents CG perspective in the banking sector through focusing on exploring CG norms used by SOBs in Egypt. This paper suggests new avenues of future research for institutional perspectives of CG by suggesting CG mechanisms in banks is only part of the overall picture covering important fundamental systems. Originality/Value: The paper provides a comprehensive study to help understand key CG mechanisms used by banks and provides theoretical implications to fill the gaps regarding CG in developing countries in general and in the banking sector in particular. The paper offers insights for policy makers interested in enhancing the efficacy of corporate governance regimes in the banking sector. (c) Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.

This monitoring role of board of director has enthralled augmented interest in present era because of sophisticated breakdown of firms such as Enron and WorldCom and successive corporate governance reforms. The efficacy of the observing role of directors relies upon many aspects like capabilities and experience of board individuals, participation in different directorships, their level of share-possession and the kind of compensation plan utilized. The checking part performed by the directors is an imperative corporate governance control component. Corporate Governance subject gained momentum after the glut of corporate scandals worldwide and collapse of the major corporate giants highlights the substance of corporate governance issues in last few decades. Since 1961, many researchers have studied relations between corporate attributes and disclosures in their yearly reports. Vast literature on corporate governance reveals its three eminent instruments-board, disclosure and ownership pattern. There is no accord among authors on the result of these components of corporate governance on company's performance. The present study has made an endeavour to review the whether corporate governance mechanism and firm performance are related to each other. Studies on company disclosure proved the link among corporate governance disclosures and performance of companies. Discoveries have determinedly indicated organization size, profitability and listing status to be prevalently aligned with disclosure levels, while blended outcomes have been accounted for leverage, liquidity, audit firm size. In India, corporate governance frameworks are still in transformative phase so the discoveries of the present review will be valuable for other recently changed and globalized economies.

We show evidence that female board representation is associated with greater innovative success, and thus enhances firm performance in innovation-intensive industries. Firms with female directors tend to invest more in innovation and obtain more patents and citations for given R&D expenditures. An increase of 10 percentage points in the tenure-weighted fraction of female directors is associated with approximately 6% more patents and 7% more citations. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, the positive association between female board representation and corporate innovation is stronger when product market competition is lower and when managers are more entrenched, consistent with increased monitoring by female directors improving managers' incentives to innovate. Furthermore, we find that female board representation is positively associated with performance only for firms for which innovation and creativity play a particularly important role.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board of directors' characteristics and performance in family businesses. It offers evidence to the question of whether a family firm (FF) differs from a non-family firm and looks at the possibility of asymmetrical effects between periods of stability and economic adversity. Design/methodology/approach: A panel data approach was applied to a sample of Portuguese firms listed the on Euronext Lisbon exchange between 2002 and 2013. Findings: The results show that FFs are likely to have a lower proportion of independent members and higher gender diversity on their boards than non-family firms. FF performance is positively related to ownership concentration and gender diversity. There are performance premiums for family businesses, which have more gender diversity than their counterparts. These effects also depend on whether the economy is in recession. The evidence suggests that the presence of women on the board and the leverage and size of the FFs have a more significant impact on the performance in periods of economic adversity. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the small size of the sample as it was drawn from the Euronext Lisbon exchange, a small stock exchange market. Originality/value: This study provides input into the academic discussion on corporate governance and FF, an area which is in need of research. In addition, the authors examine this issue in conjunction with generalised economic adversity, focusing on the possible asymmetrical effects that the nature of the board of directors may have on performance in periods of stability and those of economic adversity. The role of board of directors is crucial to the understanding of corporate behaviour and the setting of the policy that regulates corporate activities. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Our study analyzes the relationship between Board ownership structure and firm financial performance by an empirical study of 557 firms listed on Vietnam stock exchanges from their listing year to 2014. The regression results indicate that the number of members in BOD, the ownership concentration in BOD, the CEO ownership influence positively ROA, but do not have any impact on ROE. Surprisingly, the stability of BOD influences negatively the firm financial performance, both its ROA and ROE. The independent members, the number of women members, Chairman and CEO position have no significant impact, neither ROA or ROE of the firm. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

The paper shows that politically motivated interventions in the financial market in the form of bailing out borrowing firms reduce banks' incentives to gather valuable information about firms' projects. This loss of information is a hidden cost which adversely affects firm value. Firms invest resources and pay a premium to politically connected persons (BOD or other personnel). Such connections serve the twin purposes of hedging and enhancement of the value of collateral pledged against bank loans. Feeling secured, banks lose incentives to monitor borrowing firms. Thus, wealth effect of bailout from political connection is partially offset by the losses of valuable information brought about by bank lending. In equilibrium, the trade-off from gains out of political connections and costs due to losses from information-based bank monitoring depend on (i) the country's disclosure laws, (ii) the political environment, (iii) the premium paid to form connections, and (iv) the state of the economy.

The aim of this research is to examine what impact female institutional directors on boards have on corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors who may or may not maintain business relations with the companies on whose corporate boards they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors on boards and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors on boards enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold on boards (11.72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors on boards also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12.71 % on boards), above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of aggregate and individual corporate governance provisions on firm performance on all firms listed at Damascus Securities Exchange (DSE) for the period between 2011 and 2015. In addition, it disentangles ownership structure provision to ownership concentration and foreign ownership and investigates which component of ownership structure stands behind the significance of ownership structure in explaining firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses multiple linear regression models to analyze the relationship between aggregate corporate governance index and its provisions and firm performance. A corporate governance index is built on the basis of four mechanics (i.e. board of directors, audit, disclosure and ownership structure) for all firms listed at DSE. On the other hand, the dependent variable (firm performance) is measured using Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return On Assets (ROA). The authors capture current war conditions using political stability and absence of violence indicator, one of Worldwide Governance Indicators accumulated by the World bank. Findings: This study finds that ownership structure is the only significant corporate governance provision in determining Syrian firms' performance, as it loads positively and significantly on firm performance proxies (ROA and EPS). Moreover, the analysis of ownership structure items shows that foreign ownership is the main source of this positive and significant impact. This result is robust for both measures of firm performance and in the presence of political stability indicator. Originality/value: This paper provides evidence on corporate governance measures from Syrian Arab Republic, a developing country with an emerging stock exchange. It examines board structure, ownership structure, audit committee and disclosure in a period of crisis because of the war in this country. Moreover, it uncovers that foreign ownership is the only influential provision affecting firm performance at DSE. Furthermore, it combines firm-level governance indicators with country governance indicator of political stability and absence of violence. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the association between firm performance and product market competition (PMC), and then examine the mitigation effect of corporate governance and/or state-ownership (SOEs) in the association between PMC and firm performance using Chinese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The authors consider three determinants of the PMC that affect the nature of competition, and use market concentration, product substitutability and market size as proxies for PMC. The authors construct a corporate governance index which measures the extent of board independence, monitoring strength of supervisory board over board of directors, and monitoring strength of board of directors over CEO. The authors use Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm performance. The authors use a sample of 20,706 firm-year observations listed on the Chinese stock market between 2001 and 2016 to empirically investigate the research questions proposed in the paper. Findings - The authors find that higher PMC is associated with lower firm performance. The authors find that good corporate governance practices moderate the negative effect of higher PMC on firm performance. The association between higher PMC and lower performance is weaker for firms controlled by SOEs compared to non-SOEs. Further, the moderation effect of SOEs on the association between higher PMC and lower performance is more pronounced for firms with good corporate governance practices compared to firms with weak corporate governance practices. Originality/value - Extant studies investigating the relationship between PMC and corporate governance suggest an either complementary or substitution relationship in developed economies. Our study highlights the interactive role played by SOEs and good corporate governance practices in firm performance in highly competitive product markets in an emerging economy. The findings provide insightful information to regulators of other emerging countries that SOEs with good corporate governance practices can play an important role in the economy by mitigating the negative effect of higher PMC on firm performance.

We explore the impact of the Globe and Mail corporate governance index on bond spreads in a sample of Canadian listed companies. The index is composed of four sub-indices--board composition/structure, board compensation, shareholder rights, and disclosure--assessing the quality of the firm's governance. Our empirical findings point to a decrease in the bond spreads for an improvement of the overall quality of the corporate governance index. When we analyze the impact of each of the sub-indices, only the quality of the board composition/structure as well as the disclosure quality seems to matter to bondholders. We interpret our finding within the Canadian "comply or disclose" approach to governance where more responsibility is put on investors to assess and judge the quality of the governance practices. In such context, bondholders value stronger boards (in terms of composition as well structured board can mitigate agency problems), and are also particularly concerned with the quality of the firms' disclosure policies (to reduce information asymmetry). In addition to the Board Composition and the Disclosure sub-indexes, we also find a significant negative relationship between shareholder rights sub-index and the cost of debt for issuers headquartered in Quebec. Only in Quebec, features that protect shareholders from the managers (and major shareholders)' potential misbehavior seem to reduce the cost of debt. This might be due to the lower confidence that bondholders have in the Quebec French-Common-Law-based jurisdiction even after the adoption of the new Quebec Business Corporations Act in 2011.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the influences of corporate governance mechanisms on earnings management practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure, at the manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The authors consider the moderating effect of earnings management on the relationship between governance mechanisms and CSR. Design/methodology/approach: Insights are drawn from five years company data generated between 2010 and 2014, thus covering a five-year period. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis is applied to test the hypotheses developed. Finding: OLS regression results indicate that institutional ownership, managerial ownership and independent boards have a significant deterrent effect on earnings management, while institutional ownership and board of directors have significant positive impact on CSR. Moreover, OLS results reveal a strong moderation effect of earnings management and a positive link between governance and CSR. Originality/value: These findings have significant policy implications for public policy, regulatory bodies, companies and other stakeholders including the investors in Indonesia. Insights from this study will help to shape and implement an optimal governance system that can address the problem of earnings management and CSR initiatives in Indonesian companies.

This paper seeks to review the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between bank governance and performance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the existing research and offering guidance for investors and regulators on the major points of consensus and disagreement among researchers on this issue. Although the question of what determines the levels of firms' performance, with special emphasis on the role of the corporate governance, has long been the subject of substantial academic research, it gained increased attention in the banking industry in the last decade due to a series of financial scandals and, more recently, to the global financial crisis. In fact, in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, bank corporate governance mechanisms received heightened attention, accompanied by the renewed interest in the degree of effectiveness of such mechanisms, and their impact on performance. Given the vast number of influences on corporate performance, such as the numerous characteristics of the board of directors, there is an abundant literature on the determinants of performance. Thus, this paper tries to bring together this diverse body of knowledge into a coherent whole. Banks have unique attributes that interfere with the way in which the usual corporate governance mechanisms work. Thus, the main differences between banks and non-financial firms, which justify that some of the regularities found in the literature on the relationship between a set of corporate governance mechanisms and performance do not hold for banks, are also analysed. Then, we extensively review the literature on the board of directors and its impact on performance in the financial crisis and non-financial crisis periods. Finally, we also survey the (very) scarce research on the relationship between board characteristics and bank failures. (c) 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Purpose: There is an existing relationship among shareholders, boards of directors and management of companies. Corporate governance practices of companies are expected to ensure that this relationship maximises the wealth of shareholders. Differences exist among corporate governance of companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange. Companies, for purposes of liquidity, hold cash, but cash holdings also add to the cost of financing, according to working capital theories. The study, thus, sought to examine the relationship between corporate governance practices, ownership structure, cash holdings and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: The study deployed the seemingly unrelated regression to reduce the problem of multicollinearity resulting from the strong relationship between cash reserves and some control variables. Findings: The study found no significant relationship between board size and firm value. Similar findings were also made on the relationship between proportion of non-executive directors on the board and firm value. However, firms audited by the big four audit firms are valued higher by the capital market. Cash holdings of firms negatively affect performance, and this is statistically significant. A positive relationship arises between a firm's cash holdings and its value as a result of debt financing, even though this is not significant. Originality/value: The study is the first of its kind that deploys Tobin's Q as a measure of firms' value to reflect investors' valuation of firms in Ghana. The study is also the first of its kind to test the interactive effect of debt financing and cash holdings on firm value in Ghana. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

This paper reviews recent literature on financial market institutions, governance, agency costs, and misconduct, and summarizes the papers in this special issue. The papers contribute to the misconduct and governance literature in relation to the role of auditors, boards of directors, CEOs, ownership, and financial market regulation. We show Google Scholar and Web of Science trends in the comparative importance of these topics over time in the academic literature. We discuss policy implications and suggestions for future research on governance and financial market misconduct. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Most studies that have investigated the relationship between governance and performance of banks were interested in the developed countries and to a lesser extent, the emerging countries. In this study, we tried to look from an empirical perspective, at the impact of governance through some internal mechanisms, on the performance of banks in a developing country like Tunisia. According to Kolsi and Ghorbel (2011), the effect of governance on the financial and stock market performance is still unknown. This result goes in the same direction as that of Adjaoud et al. (journal compilation 15, 2007), leading to the lack of connection between governance and traditional performance measures. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of eight Tunisian commercial banks listed on the Stock Exchange over the period 2000-2011; we can conclude that there is no standard governance structure and that each bank should adopt the appropriate governance structure to improve the performance of the financial market, in general, and the banking market, in particular. The verification of this central assumption in the Tunisian context, therefore, is the fundamental contribution of this study. It is for this reason that the results we, even modest, have achieved allow enriching the issue of the impact of some governance variables varying according to the chosen performance measurement, which is a neglected theme in the Tunisian context.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Purpose: According to previous international studies, the impact of external regulation on bank risk is ambiguous. The purpose of this paper is to ask the question, "When do regulations matter for bank risk-taking?" by reporting the first empirical investigation of how the relation between bank regulations (capital requirements, official supervisory power and market discipline) and bank risk-taking is moderated by board monitoring characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Using SYS-GMM, the analysis of the interaction between bank-level boards of directors' attributes (board size, board independence and board gender diversity) and external regulation is based on a sample of 493 banks operating in 54 countries over 2001-2015, accounting for three measures of bank risk-taking. Findings: Regulations matter for bank risk-taking conditional on board characteristics: board size, board independence and board diversity. With the exception of capital requirements, the market discipline exerted by external private monitoring and greater supervisory power are unable to mitigate the propensity to greater risk-taking by banks resulting from larger board size, higher board independence and greater gender diversity of the board. Originality/value: The bank risk empirical literature is still silent as to the interaction between board governance and regulation for the purpose of examining banks' risk-taking. This paper fills this gap, thus making a significant contribution by extending our knowledge of whether and how board governance moderates the relationship between external regulation and bank risk-taking.

Using a panel dataset of non-financial public companies in Italy covering the period 2005-2013, this paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between female representation on corporate boards and corporate debt. The presence of women in the boardroom might seem to push significantly on debt leverage and suggest a complementary role in the control and monitoring of agency costs. However, consistent with Kanter's (Am J Sociol 82(5), 965-990, 1977) critical mass theory, that at a level of tokenism women take on a complementary role and at greater levels, their role either becomes a substitute for debt level, or plays a weaker complementary role in debt level and in the monitoring of agency costs. The presence of women board members who are linked to the family firm appears to significantly decrease the degree of debt leverage. Furthermore, the presence of greater female representation in the boardroom decreases the agency costs to the firm. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The present research is focused on studying the effect of board director's characteristics on the real earnings management (management sales manipulation proxy) measured by the abnormal level of operating cash flows. Our empirical study has been conducted on a sample of 29 Tunisian-listed companies over the period ranging from 2009 to 2013. The study finds a negative impact of board size, board independence, and board meetings on the sales manipulation. Concerning the CEO chairman duality, the results show no association with the level of sales management. This leads us to conclude that the board of directors seems to have a significant effect on delimiting the sales management practice. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of board gender diversity on the transparency of corporate political disclosure (CPD). Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical proxies, CPD transparency and policy transparency, are constructed from a data set jointly produced by the Center of Political Activity and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research. The CPD transparency score measures the level of transparency in voluntary corporate disclosure of the amount of political contributions and the identity of the recipients as well as the titles and names of the executives who authorize the political spending. The policy transparency score measures the level of transparency in the voluntary disclosure of the policies governing corporate political spending. Board gender diversity is measured by the percentage of women on the board of directors. Findings: Higher proportions of female directors are associated with more transparent disclosure of political contributions after controlling for a set of corporate governance and firm-level variables. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine whether and how gender-diversified boards enhance the transparency of CPD. It contributes to the literature by providing evidence that gender-diversified boards enhance corporate governance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the mediating effect of dividend payout on the relationship between internal governance mechanisms (board of directors and ownership structure) and the free cash flow level. Design/methodology/approach: Linear regression models are used to investigate such relationships applying data from a sample of 207 non-financial firms listed on the Gulf Cooperation Council countries' stock markets between 2009 and 2016. To test the significance of mediating effect, the author uses the Sobel test. Findings: The author finds a partial mediation effect of dividend on the relationship between both board independence and managerial ownership and the level of free cash flow. The results confirm the major role of outside directors in corporate governance. This governance mechanism contributes to the protection of shareholders' interests through a generous dividend policy. However, the author finds that large managerial shareholdings increase the level of free cash flow through lower dividend payouts. This result suggests that powerful managers follow their preference of retaining excess cash to their own interests. Practical implications: This paper offers insights to policy-makers of emerging economies interested in the development of the corporate governance. This study provides guidance for firms in the construction and implementation of their own corporate governance policies. Originality/value: The main contribution of the present paper is to examine the dividend payout as a potential mediating variable between internal governance mechanisms and free cash flow. Moreover, it highlights the issue of efficient management of substantial funds in Sharia-compliant and non-Sharia-compliant firms. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to explore how the economic recession and some corporate governance (CG) provisions can affect the performance of Italian gambling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across different business segments. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel sample of 2,135 observations before and during the global financial crisis. Specifically, the roles of ownership, boards of directors, chief executive officer gender and gambling business segments are investigated in the Italian gambling market. Findings: Ownership concentration has a negative relationship with the performance of foreigner- and financial-owned firms, while boards exert a positive role on performance. Interestingly, the financial crisis does not impact the performance of Italian gambling SMEs and some business segments, such as bingo, perform even better during the crisis. Research limitations/implications: Further investigations should analyze the role of single games on firm performance. The consumer- and firm-level examinations offer very different perspectives and scholars should be aware of this when investigating the gambling industry. Practical implications: This study might help both policymakers and other gambling firms, such as casinos, to better understand which appropriate CG model should be adopted and how it can positively influence performance, especially in recessionary times. Originality/value: This study contributes to studies on hospitality and tourism by focusing on the complementary role of gambling SMEs with respect to casinos. It also increases knowledge on the role of CG in privately owned gambling firms, which thus far has been scantly investigated by scholars. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

I review the empirical research on the role of stakeholders in corporate governance with an emphasis in contributions from the accounting literature. In particular, I focus on the following stakeholders: employees, the general public, the media, related firms, the government, private regulators, gatekeepers, and foreigners. This list does not include capital providers (shareholders and debt-holders), as the governance role of these stakeholders has already been covered by prior surveys in the academic literature. The discussion is structured around each stakeholder's incentives to influence managerial behavior, the mechanisms through which stakeholders act on managerial actions, as well as any concerns about this influence. All the analyzed stakeholders appear capable of influencing managerial actions to some extent, but the efficacy of stakeholders' monitoring role is controversial. Empirical research uncovers several factors that undermine stakeholders' incentives to discipline corporate managers. And more critically, in some cases stakeholders' incentives appear to be misaligned not only with shareholders' interests but also with the public interest. Taken together, the reviewed evidence suggests that the monitoring role involves a wide range of actors beyond the board of directors and capital providers. The review also points out that there is still much to learn about stakeholder monitoring. (c) 2018 G. Ormazabal.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the mechanisms of corporate governance on the volatility of companies' financial profitability. Design/methodology/approach: For the period 2002-2014, the authors evaluate the relations linking various indices involved in corporate governance with the systematic risk supported by these companies for a sample of 355 firms domiciled in Europe. To empirically test these relationships, the authors calculated a synthetic index of corporate governance quality (QGI) based on the 53 items of assessment of the companies' governance proposed by the database ASSET4. Following the method used by Boncori et al. (2016), the authors first reduced the number of dimensions of corporate governance by performing a principal component analysis of the sample, which resulted in the following five components: management's shareholder commitment, shareholder rights, characteristics of the board of directors, transparency of the financial information and independence of the audit. Findings: The results of the tests indicate that the synthetic index of governance that the authors have built is only significant at the 10 percent threshold. The impact of this variable on the systematic risk of the company is of the order of one-tenth of a point. The decomposition of this index into five variables shows that management's commitment to shareholders and the effectiveness of the board of directors in carrying out its supervisory tasks are likely to reduce, but again to a limited extent, the risk borne by the company. Research limitations/implications: This observation guides the future work in introducing variables that reflect the social responsibilities of the companies in the sample in order to distinguish the effects of social responsibility from those of purely shareholder-oriented governance on systematic risk. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates the interest of good governance on the risk of firms and identifies certain characteristics upon which to act. Originality/value: Although the relations between corporate governance mechanisms and profitability expectations have been the subject of numerous studies, few authors have examined the influence of governorship on the volatility of this profitability, particularly in Europe. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the rare work on this topic relates to only a limited number of countries. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Recent literature emphasizes the importance of a director's external network of social connections. I use a sample of closed-end funds to show that internal, within-board connections are also significant determinants of shareholder value. I find that boards with shared education, employment, and family backgrounds exhibit lower market values, higher expense ratios, higher director compensation levels, and an increased likelihood of financial misrepresentation. Director turnover is lower within these boards, and new director appointments are more likely to share connections with incumbent directors. I conclude that internal board networks negatively impact a firm's governance environment and overall monitoring quality. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate an increasingly prevalent CEO succession strategy: recruiting CEOs from the board of directors (director-CEOs). Director-CEOs might be hired in a planned succession because they combine outsiders' new perspectives with insiders' firm-specific knowledge. Alternatively, directors may be recruited when the board is unprepared for a leadership change. We find that unplanned successions, in which director-CEOs are appointed as a quick-fix solution, result in a negative market reaction, deterioration in performance, and ill-fitting candidates with shorter tenures. Conversely, firms recruiting director-CEOs in planned successions perform similarly to other firms. We find no evidence that poor firm quality drives these results. (c) 2018 Michael G.

The co-existence of an unbridled self-interested board of directors with weak corporate governance provides firms with a strong incentive to exert more earnings management. Since directors form the core of corporate governance, once they act as Fat Cats (board members who are both in charge of a company and have the power to increase their own pay substantially) to connive in earnings management, this in turn will incur substantial damage to the quality of the firm's financial information. First, thus, this study investigates whether these directors guide executives to perform more earnings manipulation. Next, to examine the impact of regulatory reforms in Taiwan on Fat Cat firms' earnings management, we probe whether these firms exert less earnings management after they were denoted as being Fat Cats. This study employs Benford's law to overcome the shortcomings of accrual models' insufficient explanatory power on the detection of earnings management, because Benford's law uses the first or the second digit of holistic data to identify if the distribution of whole numbers deviates from the theoretical distribution. The test results present solid evidence that Fat Cat firms do exert more earnings manipulation than non-Fat Cat firms do, and further find that these firms still perform a certain degree of earnings management after they were announced as being Fat Cats. The results suggest that legislative authorities and investors may re-examine whether the competent authorities have created a suitable environment to enhance the quality of listed firms' financial statements.

We study the role of directors appointed by banks and those appointed by investment funds in the informativeness of accounting earnings in a low investor protection environment with a high presence of institutional directors. Results suggest that the monitoring role of directors appointed by banks and funds improves investor protection and increases market confidence in accounting information. The paper has interesting academic and policy implications for the debate on the proper degree of institutional involvement in corporate governance, noting that when analyzing the role of institutional investors, researchers must take into account investors' participation in other mechanisms of corporate control such as the board of directors. We contribute to the literature by showing that, in a weak regulatory and low investor protection environment, one of the ways in which institutional investors play a monitoring role is through influencing earnings quality when they are both shareholders and board members.

Gender equality on boards is a global and highly politicized issue. To this day, there is considerable cross-country variation in female board representation. We examine institutional supply- and demand-side factors associated with this issue. Our results indicate that a societal climate of gender equality contributes to more women on boards, mainly through fostering the supply of suitable candidates. Therefore, the glass ceiling should be improved through a societal supply-side effort which needs to complement demand-side (quota) regulation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains--technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance. (c) 2018

We analyze the governance structure of three main French banking groups (BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, and Societe Generale) in the context of the global financial crisis. To this end, We, first, show the heterogeneity within the ownership structures of these three banks, which points differences with regard to performance among these banks. Second, we underscore the importance of institutional investors in stimulating banking growth. Finally, we note that the high number of independent directors on the boards of directors of BNP Paribas and Societe Generale as well as the use of incentive pay in executive compensation might explain the excess risk taking of these banks.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of corporate governance (focused on some key mechanisms as board size, board independence, managerial ownership, institutional ownership, and chief executive officer duality) on financial analysts' behavior in US. Results from panel data analysis for 294 US listed firms observed from 2007 to 2014 show that several attributes of the board of directors and audit committee have no effects on the number of analysts who are following the firm and the properties of analysts' earnings forecasts. Findings also suggest that firms with independent and large boards and blockholders ownership benefit of more analyst following. In addition, it is proven that analysts' earnings forecasts are optimistic and more accurate for companies where blockholder ownership, either by managers or external entities have larger quoted spreads but of lower quality for the ones which have greater independent board members and institutional investor's holding.

We examine the relation between the presence of an independent director who is a blockholder (IDB) and corporate policies, risk-taking, and market valuation. After accounting for endogeneity, firms with an IDB have significantly (1) lower levels of cash holdings, payout and research and development (R&D) expenditures, (2) higher levels of capital expenditures, and (3) lower risk. The market appears to value IDB presence and the associated decrease in dividend yield. About 75% of the IDBs in our sample are individual investors, who drive most of our results. Our findings suggest that IDB presence plays a valuable role in shaping some corporate policies and allocating corporate resources. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

This paper examines the relation among corporate governance practices, pyramid ownership structure, and firm value by using a sample of Vietnamese listed firms. Using a sample of 103 non-financial firms listed on HOSE for the period from 2012 to 2014, and employing two-stage least square regression (2SLS) to deal with potential endogeneity, we find that some indicators, commonly adopted as a key components of corporate governance, such as size or independence of board of directors, are imperfect proxies for corporate governance practices. Our results indicate that it is better to employ a corporate governance index (CGI), including 117 criteria developed by Connelly, Limpaphayom, and Nagarajan (2012) since it allows for more comprehensive estimation of corporate governance. More interestingly, our results show that the pyramid ownership plays an important role in the effect of corporate governance on firm value. The results are consistent regardless of whether companies have high or low family ownership. (c) 2018. Journal of Economic Development. All Rights Reserved.

The two-tier board system practiced in Indonesia provides greater opportunity for the majority shareholders to place representative on board which may expropriate interest of minority shareholders and increase information asymmetry. This study looks at the influence of family ownership on firm's performance, by differentiating the influence of family ownership from family involvement in companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Family ownership is measured based on family's equity ownership in the firm and family's involvement. This study explores family involvement in threefold: involvement in the board of commissioners, involvement in the board of directors and involvement in both boards. Firm performance is measured based on Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) which comprises of capital employed efficiency, human capital efficiency, and structural capital efficiency. Data was collected for a period of three years from 2007 to 2009 on 155 firms which were identified as family firms. The findings show that family ownership has a positive influence on firm performance. Family involvement, however, shows mixed results. Family involvement in the board of commissioners has a positive but insignificant influence on firm's performance. Family involvement in the board of directors has a negative influence on firm's performance. Family involvement in both boards has a positive influence on firm performance. The findings suggest that family involvement in both boards creates a balance between the supervisory function and the management function, thus resulting in a more effective monitoring of firm's management.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the effect of French family control on the cash flow sensitivity of cash (CFSC). It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French-listed companies from 2012 to 2014, the authors use GLS regression models on panel data estimated with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Findings: The results show that family control is positively associated with the CFSC. This finding suggests that families are likely to hold more cash out of their cash flows for entrenchment and expropriation purposes. A further analysis shows that board size, independence and the two-tier board structure negatively affect the CFSC in family firms. Board efficiency is then a guarantee of minority shareholders' interests against family expropriation risks in France. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that French family firms are likely to expropriate minority interests by extracting rents through their cash holding behavior. However, in the presence of high-quality board features, the relation turns negative, suggesting that the quality of the board is an efficient corporate governance device that is likely to monitor family corporate decisions. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research by investigating the moderating effect of board features on the relation between family control and the CFSC. The research provides a metric for agency problems that is the sensitivity of cash to cash flows and offers theoretical support for the agency argument of hoarding cash.

The resistance to financial crisis and compliance with social norms and effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms is considered recently as a good matter of concern. Focusing on differences between French and Saudi firms, we examine the effect of (1) board of directors, (2) audit committee, (3) compliance with Corporate Social Responsibility activities, (4) compliance with Shariah principles on financial volatility during subprime crisis of 2007. We find that larger boards, larger audit committees, independent members on boards and audit committees are related negatively to financial volatility. The result supports corporate governance theory which suggests that corporate governance variables outlined provide effective of monitoring of the management thereby enhancing firm's resistance to financial crisis. In addition, we find that compliance with CSR alone does not explain the financial volatility. Its concert with corporate governance variables is necessary. This result supports stakeholder theory which argues that companies compliant with CSR activities in their business strategy and have larger boards and audit committees, and independent directors on boards and audit committees resist more financial downturns and any economic shock. Furthermore, we find that compliance with Shariah norms plays a significant role in protecting shareholder interests, improving functioning of corporate governance mechanisms and affect positively the resistance of Saudi firms to financial crisis.

This paper attempts to extend the concept of 'bundle of governance mechanisms' and analyses the dynamics of various governance mechanisms in relation to each other. Further, this paper seeks to answer if it is justified to exercise a huge reliance on board monitoring alone while designing or analysing the governance structure of a firm. This paper uses the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) approach to analyse the various hierarchical relationships based on the relative driving power and dependence of various monitoring mechanisms. The findings suggest that a huge reliance on board monitoring is justified to an extent as it has the driving power to strengthen other governance mechanisms. However, the relationship between board monitoring and firm performance is moderated by other governance mechanisms like product market competition and ownership concentration. Thus, board monitoring alone should not be considered as a benchmark to assess the quality of the governance structure of a firm. (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Transparent and effective corporate governance positively influences the financial stability of the company: it increases the investment attractiveness and reduces the cost of lending. For Russia, this problem is relatively new. And at the moment, corporate management in the manufacturing industry continues to be characterized by a high concentration of ownership and a combination of ownership and management functions. In this paper, using logistic regression we investigate the impact of corporate governance factors and sector expectations on a negative net worth of the companies in the period 2011-2015. The results showed, in particular, the probability of a negative company's net worth is higher, the lower the index of business confidence in the industry; the presence of agency problem; the smaller the number of member in the board of directors; the higher concentration of ownership; and, if company is not privately owned or joint stock company. Robustness of the coefficients of the final specification was confirmed. (c) 2018 New Economic Association. All rights reserved.

The central point of this paper is to present the results of comparative case study research concerning the impact of the interplay between formal and informal institutions in the corporate governance systems (CGS) of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). Particular focus was put on the values of the corporate governance codes (CGC) of CEECs, as well as on transparent ownership structures, transactions with related parties, the protection of minority shareholders, independent members of supervisory boards, and separation between the CEO position and the chairman of the board of directors. The main subject of interest concerns two research areas: the character of the relationship between formal and informal institutions, as well as whether the interplay between them is relevant to the CGSs of CEECs. Moreover, the author investigates whether the CGCs of CEECs consist of regulations that are compatible with the values set up in preambles using research methods such as individual case study or deductive reasoning. The conclusion presented in the paper was drawn on the basis of a review of the literature and research on national and European corporate governance regulations, as well as the CGC of CEECs. The primary contribution this article makes is to advance the stream of research beyond any single country setting, and to link the literature on the interplay between formal and informal institutions related to CGSs in a broad range of economies in transition ('catch up' countries) like CEECs. This paper provides an understanding of how the interplay between formal and informal institutions may influence the CGCs of CEECs. (c) 2018 Malgorzata Godlewska et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

The modernization of corporate governance aims the alignment of the interests of managers with those of companies, promoting a new discipline of internal controls and risk analysis with an enforcement of shareholder rights of information. This research investigates the impact of corporate governance variables--ownership, board of directors and remuneration committee--on executive compensation. A balanced sample of 52 Italian listed companies has been adopted to test the hypotheses, covering 55.98% and 47.13% of market capitalization in 2011 and 2015, respectively, and including 669 board members. Theoretical models evidence a certain stability of compensation schemes for Italian managers over time. Findings suggest that there is a statistically significant positive effect of familiar ownership on the amount of compensation. Along with the nature of ownership, the number of directors in the remuneration committee appointed by minorities assumes a determinant role. With statistical significance, it affects negatively the compensation level, but, contrarily to best practices, it affects negatively the adoption of forms of incentive compensation.

Corporate governance codes, including a set of voluntary recommendations, have been developed around the world as a result of successive financial crises and scandals. To date, the question of their effectiveness remains largely open and debated in the international context. The objective of the article is to study the influence of compliance with a governance code on earnings management in France. This issue arises especially after the introduction of the DDAC law (2008), which provides for French listed companies the reference to a governance code according to the "comply or explain" principle. The results of the study show that companies in the SBF120 index have progressively increased their compliance with the code over the period (2006-2013). Moreover, compliance (and the evolution of this compliance) is negatively associated with accrual and real earnings management. The requirements of the code relating to the board of directors and its committees seem to limit earnings management, whereas the requirements relating to executives and their remuneration have no effect on earnings management. These results seem to confirm the positive impact of governance code on earnings quality. (c) Association Francophone de Comptabilite. Tous droits reserves pour tous pays.

This study investigates the cross-sectional variation in debt restructuring among Malaysian publicly listed Government Linked companies (GLCs) and non-GLCs (NGLCs) for the period of from 2005 to 2015. It attempts to test several firm determinants that can influence the likelihood of Malaysian GLCs to exercise debt restructuring. Past studies argue that liquidity and profitability influences firm's choice to exercise debt restructuring. This study proposes variants of board of characteristics as one of the influential factors in GLCs debt restructuring since board of directors for this type of organization are usually controlled or owned by government. We employ imbalanced panel data with logistic regression as the method of analysis. The findings show that liquidity, profitability and board characteristics have significant relationship with debt restructuring. The results for profitability indicates that firm with low profitability has higher chance for debt restructuring exercise. However, liquidity has recorded an opposite relationship in our sample. This may be due to our liquidity measures the focuses on short term assets which is less appropriate in debt restructuring context. With regards to board characteristics, three variables such as board size, fraction of Malay directors and fraction of directors with Master degrees show negative and significant relationship influence on the debt restructuring.

This study investigates the effect of corporate governance structure on the quality of accounting information disclosure using Shenzhen stock exchange data. Existing literatures reported that corporate governance can help to improve accounting quality. However, China's corporate governance structure may have different consequences from prior studies because it has less maturity than developed countries in Europe and the United States. China government, in particular, has a very strong influence on the companies in China and we needs to be verified if the corporate governance structure works properly. From the empirical tests, we find that the proportion of state-owned shares, the proportion of tradable shares, ownership concentration, the size of the board of directors, the proportion of ownership of the board of directors, and size of the board of supervisors are positively associated with the quality of accounting information disclosure. This study will contribute to academics and practitioners by documenting the factors of corporate governance structure on accounting disclosure quality in China.

Recently, foreigners have been responsible for negotiating more than half of the shares issued by the companies listed in the Brazilian Stock Market. In order to understand the characteristics of companies that influence the increase of international financing, the aim of this article was to investigate the relation between foreign investment in public offerings and board composition. We examine data of 183 Brazilian IPOs and subsequent offerings from 2004-2016 using OLS regression. The empirical result suggested that companies that have a foreign director as a board member and are in a special listing segment of B3--bound by rules of corporate governance--tend to attract more foreign investment. This means that foreigners are sensitive to good corporate governance practices when financing Brazilian firms' IPOs or that issue new shares. Our findings imply that improvements in the corporate governance practice of companies could increase their ability to raise foreign capital. RESUMERecientemente, mas de la mitad de las acciones emitidas por las empresas cotizadas en la Bolsa de Valores brasilena fueron negociadas por extranjeros. El objeto de este estudio consistio en investigar la relacion existente entre las inversiones extranjeras en las ofertas publicas y la composicion de sus juntas directivas, para entender las caracteristicas de las empresas que contribuyen a aumentar el financiamiento internacional. Utilizando la regresion de minimos cuadrados ordinarios dinamicos (MCOD, OLS en ingles), examinamos datos de la Oferta Publica Inicial Brasilena 183 (IPO) asi como ofertas subsiguientes del periodo 2004-2016. El resultado empirico obtenido sugiere que las empresas cuya junta directiva tiene como miembro un director extranjero y constan en un segmento de cotizacion especial (B3), sujeto a normas de gobernanza corporativa, suelen atraer mas inversiones extranjeras. Esto implica que, al financiarlas, los extranjeros son mas susceptibles a que las empresas brasilenas que abren su capital o emiten nuevas acciones, usen buenas practicas de gobernanza corporativa. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la implementacion de mejoras en las practicas de gobernanza corporativa de las empresas puede aumentar su financiamiento internacional. RESUMORecentemente os estrangeiros passaram a ser responsaveis pela negociacao de mais da metade das acoes emitidas pelas empresas listadas na Bolsa de Valores brasileira. Para entender as caracteristicas das empresas que influenciam o aumento do financiamento internacional, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo o estudo da relacao entre o investimento estrangeiro nas ofertas publicas e a composicao das diretorias. Examinamos dados de 183 IPOs (Oferta Publica Inicial) e de ofertas subsequentes, de 2004 a 2016, usando a regressao MQO (OLS na sigla em ingles). O resultado empirico sugere que as empresas que tem um diretor estrangeiro na diretoria e que estao no segmento de listagem especial da B3--sujeitas as normas de governanca corporativa--tendem a atrair mais investimentos. Isso significa que os estrangeiros estao alerta quanto as boas praticas de governanca ao considerar empresas brasileiras que abrem o capital ou que emitem acoes novas. Os nossos achados sugerem que melhorias nas praticas de governanca corporativa das empresas podem elevar o financiamento internacional das empresas. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

This paper analyzes firms' choice of replacement CEOs after unexpected CEO turnovers, and the impact of the replacement decision on shareholder wealth. More specifically, I investigate whether the selection of replacement CEOs from the board facilitates a smoother leadership transition. I find that while selecting replacement CEO from existing board members allows the company to quickly fill the CEO position, thereby reducing uncertainty and transitional costs (measured by new CEO turnover, senior management turnover and delay), it may not be beneficial to shareholders. I provide evidence that replacing departing CEO with a board member is negatively associated with stock performance for up to two years. This paper is a step forward towards the understanding of the roles boards play in the CEO succession and new CEO hiring process. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

This paper analyzes the relationship between bank governance mechanisms and credit risk in the MENA region. Methodology: Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to analyze a sample of 38 commercial MENA banks for the period 2004-2015. Findings: We confirm that different combinations of governance mechanisms can yield similar levels of credit risk taking. A single board characteristic is not sufficient to explain the credit policy of MENA banks. The independence of the board appears to be a necessary condition for reducing credit risk. The high proportion of institutional directors is associated with higher credit risk taking. In addition, we find that CEO duality and the high proportion of foreign directors were substitutes for one another. Originality: This research presents an application analysis of fsQCA in the MENA region. We examine the role of optimal configurations of the boards of directors of MENA banks. Unlike techniques previously used to investigate bank governance, such as multiple regression analysis, the fsQCA approach reveals which governance practices are relevant, and which are redundant, for achieving effective control in credit risk management.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

Establishing effective corporate governance is most important at the time of an initial public offering (IPO), because the IPO represents a significant step by a company toward moving to the public arena. This chapter focuses on three characteristics that help describe structure of the board of directors at the time of IPO: board size (i.e., the number of members on a board), board independence (i.e., the proportion of non-executive members on the board), and board leadership (i.e., the choice to overlap the roles of CEO and chairman of the board). The chapter presents empirical evidence from a sample of 969 companies that went public between 1995 and 2011 in France, Germany, and Italy that shows how these companies differ from their US and UK counterparts.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose: Using a data set of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, this paper aims to empirically assess the effects of ownership structure and board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, this study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, two stage least squares (2SLS) regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, together with a two-tier board system and no chief executive officer duality, the stronger the firm's performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holders' ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership are all positively related to firm value. Research limitations/implications: Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value: First, unlike most of the previous literature on Western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies used a single indicator of firm performance, this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using 2SLS estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Purpose: This study aims to link environmental disclosure quality (EDQ) to firm performance and examine the moderating role of board independence in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory and stakeholder theory, the authors developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 720 firm-year observations collected from 120 Iranian companies over six years between 2011 and 2016. In this paper, they conducted static and dynamic panel data analysis. Findings: After correcting for endogeneity bias, the results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between EDQ and firm performance. The results also showed that board independence significantly reinforces the positive effect of EDQ on performance, and firms with more independent board members are involved environmental disclosure for improved performance. This is consistent with agency theory, which posits that a more independent board of directors can better monitor the CEO and reduce incentives for pursuing personal interests, which in turn improves performance. The results are robust after performing sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: This paper takes the perspective of corporate governance to empirically examine the effect of EDQ on firm performance. This study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that board independence moderates the effects of EDQ on firm performance. Practical implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. Originality/value: The study adds value to the understanding of the effect of the EDQ on performance and how board independence influences this relationship, particularly in an emerging economy like Iran.

Drawing on self-construal theory and the family business literature, we offer theory and evidence on how the presence of women, either family members or not, on the board of directors of family firms affects firm engagement in corporate citizenship behavior. In examining corporate citizenship behavior, we argue that it is important to distinguish between corporate social responsibility and philanthropy as well as between family and non-family women on the board of directors. Using data from the population of 63 family-controlled firms in the global ranking of the top-100 fashion firms, we find support for our hypotheses: female directors are beneficial for corporate social responsibility engagement only if they are not members of the controlling family, while they are beneficial for philanthropic engagement only if they are members of the controlling family.

The study investigates impact of board diversity and quality audit on financial performance by analyzing listed firms in Pakistan. Board diversity is investigated in terms of nationality diversity and gender diversity. Audit is studied in domain of quality audit and audit cost. Although various organizations want to have diverse board structure but still the implication of board diversity in firm performance is uncertain. Here in this study results illustrated an interesting depiction of board diversity and firm financial performance. Higher audit cost leads to more efficient audit services as compare to companies having less audit cost. The study sample comprises of listed companies in Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE) 100 Index. PSE-100 index is selected on the basis of sector representation and highest market capitalization. Panel data set is collected with time span from 2008 to 2017. In methodology, the study utilized quantitative techniques from econometrics on panel data to fill the research gap in the existing governance literature. Findings suggest that presence of female board members contributed to enhance firm performance while number of female board members in board of director is not related to firm financial performance. Nationality diversity is negatively associated with firm financial performance mostly due to difference in cross-cultural perceptions and communication barriers. High audit cost indicates a good quality audit, due to the fact that extended audit hours and expert audit staff conduct more comprehensive investigation, which cost higher audit fees.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

The most successful and longest-enduring family firms are progressively encouraging the active presence of women on their corporate boards. Why is the presence of women on boards so important for family firms? And how can policy makers and controlling owners encourage the active presence of women on family business corporate boards? By integrating the literature on women in governance and the goals of family businesses, we take a step toward increasing shareholder awareness of the economic and noneconomic benefits that women can bring to the family business boardroom. Using theory and empirical evidence, we show that the presence of women on corporate boards can be instrumental for the controlling owners of a family business to achieve prosperity and success, to preserve family cohesion, and to improve the reputation of the family and business simultaneously. Furthermore, we discuss the socioemotional and economic ramifications of excluding women from the family business board of directors. We conclude with four practical recommendations for encouraging the active presence of women on family business boards. (c) 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between earnings management and the efficiency of French firms' investments. It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of French listed companies from 2011 to 2015, i.e. 435 firm-year observations. The authors use the instrumental variable method based on 2SLS models. Findings: The authors show that there is a negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency. This finding supports the theoretical perspective of the agency theory, as the propensity of firms to engage in earnings management practices is associated with high managerial opportunistic behavior and asymmetric information issues, leading to the problem of under and overinvestment. The findings also show that board size, independence and gender diversity are positively associated with investment efficiency. These board features moderate the relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggesting that earnings quality plays a more prominent role in guiding managers to choose the right investments when the corporate governance environment is strong. Research limitations/implications: The negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggests that firms with lower earnings quality are exposed to high information asymmetries. They are then more likely to deviate from their expected level of investments. In addition, the results highlight the importance of corporate financial transparency and board monitoring to reduce agency costs and ensure the efficiency of corporate investments, particularly in a setting where investors' interests are poorly protected. Originality/value: This paper is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge to examine the effect of earnings management, a metric for earnings quality, on the corporate investment efficiency in France. Besides, they extend previous literature by investigating how board features are able to monitor managerial actions and decisions and therefore to moderate the effect of earnings management on investment efficiency.

Adopting the socioemotional wealth perspective, we argue that the presence of a family CEO in family SMEs negatively affects export scope, but that such negative effect is mitigated by board service. We develop and test a model that considers the synergistic combination of family management and another important aspect of family governance in the context of family firm internationalization: the service behavior of the board of directors. The empirical evidence from a sample of 248 Belgian family SMEs shows that governance is crucial to overcoming the problems of family management: family CEOs may negatively influence export scope, but board service is able to turn the tide so that the family CEO effect becomes positive. With such novel findings, we contribute to international business and family business studies (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: Chief executive officer (CEO) ability may have an effect on various corporate reporting decisions, and consequently, the CEO ability is subject to scrutiny by regulatory reviewers. However, theoretical literature provides mixed evidence on how the CEO ability affects the regulatory review risk. Thus, this study aims to empirically examine the effect of CEO ability on regulatory review risk. Design/methodology/approach: To measure CEO ability, this study uses the CEO ability-score developed by Demerjian et al. (2012). Further, to measure regulatory review risk, the study uses the probability of receiving a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran. Findings: This study finds that the relationship between CEO ability and regulatory review risk is generally negative and statistically significant but not economically significant, i.e. the relationship is very small. In this regard, the study shows that the relationship is negative and also statistically and economically significant for firms with low levels of agency conflicts and high levels of corporate governance quality; and is positive and also statistically and economically significant for firms with high levels of agency conflicts and low levels of corporate governance quality. In addition, while the study finds no evidence that the regulatory reviewers' workload compression influences the general relationship between CEO ability and regulatory review risk, it documents that low (high) regulatory reviewers' workload compression weakens (strengthens) both the relationships stated above. Originality/value: Collectively, the results suggest that the agency conflicts/corporate governance quality and regulatory reviewers' workload compression are important factors in the analysis of the relationship between the CEO ability and regulatory review risk. The results offer insights into the opposing theoretical viewpoints about the relationship between CEO ability and regulatory review risk. Thus, the results will be of interest to boards of directors and other stakeholders involved in the regulatory review process. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of enterprise risk management (ERM). Design/methodology/approach: The method is to develop a theory for ERM based on identifying the general risk management problems that it is supposed to solve and to apply the principle of deduction based on these premises. Findings: ERM consists of risk governance, which is a set of mechanisms that deals with the agency problem of risk management and risk aggregation, which is a set of mechanisms that deals with the information problem of risk management. Research limitations/implications: The theory, by identifying the central role of the Board of Directors, encourages further research into the capabilities and incentives of directors as determinants of ERM adoption. It also encourages research into how ERM adoption depends on proxies for agency problems of risk management, such as a decentralized company structure. Practical implications: The theory encourages Boards of Directors to focus on understanding where the under and over management of risk are likely to be greatest, as opposed to the current practice of mapping a large number of risk factors. Originality/value: The theory complements existing theory on corporate risk management, which revolves around the role of external frictions, by focusing on internal frictions in the firm that prevent effective risk management. It is the first work to delineate ERM vis-a-vis existing risk theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Next to value creation, the value protection function of the Board of Directors is a widely accepted fact. Nevertheless, the current literature struggles to show a positive impact of the Board Value Protection (BVP) on firm performance. We use the decision rights model of board functions and argue the difference between board member roles (insider vs independent) and functions, to isolate the BVP from other director functions. By using the German context as a natural setting, we can isolate the BVP and show how it evolves with the firm lifecycle and owner motivations. Based on a sample of 446 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 1995 to 2015, our results show that the importance of BVP in young firms decreases with age, increases in mature firms and that this effect is stronger in family firms.

We find that the presence of independent directors who are blockholders (IDBs) in firms promotes better CEO contracting and monitoring, and higher firm valuation. Using a panel of about 11,500 firm-years with a unique, hand-collected dataset on IDB-identity and a novel instrument, we find that firms with IDBs have lower excess CEO pay, lower flow and stock of CEO equity incentives, and higher valuations. These effects are substantial and robust. Our findings imply that by making it easier for blockholders to obtain a board seat, proxy access rules or bylaws can benefit shareholders.

This study examines the stock price response to Document 18, a regulation released in China in 2013 requiring independent directors with political connections to resign from the boards of directors for publicly listed firms. We document a significant positive price response in the window surrounding the directive's promulgation date. This response is also of important economic magnitude. Our findings suggest that on average, the market views the costs of hiring politically connected directors as outweighing the associated benefits. Consistent with this view, we document that politically connected directors often shirk their board duties, as evidenced by their poor rates of attendance at board meetings. Further investigations show that the value decreasing effect of politically connected directors is apparent mainly for firms in regulated industries and varies with earnings management practices.

This study investigates the impact of corporate governance on the level of information asymmetry. In addition, the study examines whether a firm's political connections have a moderating effect on this relationship. Based on a sample of leading listed local banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries, the findings indicate that proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are inversely related to proxies for information asymmetry. Specifically, greater board independence, blockholders, institutional ownership, and board size are associated with greater information asymmetry as reflected in share trading volume, market value of shares traded, and volatility of shares returns, whereas a Chief Executive Officer (CEO)'s also being on the Board of Directors is not significantly related to the level of information asymmetry. Moreover, removing insiders from the board may harm the company because outside directors lack the knowledge and experience to steer the company appropriately. Similarly, blockholders and institutional ownership both have a limited role in information dissemination in the GCC markets. Larger boards are ineffective in information dissemination because communication, coordination, and decision-making problems are greater. However, the interactions between the proxy for the firm's political connections and corporate governance mechanisms are negatively related to the level of information asymmetry. The results indicate that firms with strong corporate governance and political connections may disseminate more information than firms that are politically unconnected. The results also imply that firm-level governance mechanisms and political connections in the GCC are crucial to improve the level of a firm's transparency. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: In order to deepen our knowledge of governance of family firms, the purpose of this paper is to focus our attention on the relation between family owners who are members of the board of directors and firm performance. Also, this study sheds more light on how the generation in charge of the family firm affects that relationship, as generational involvement may be a unique predictor of governance behavior in these firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 313 non-listed Spanish family SMEs. The authors suggest the possibility of a non-linear relationship between the percentage of ownership by family members of the board of directors and firm performance, and specifically, the authors propose an S-shaped effect that implies two breakpoints. Findings: The authors find not only that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists, but also an S-shaped relationship between family board members' ownership and firm performance in family SMEs. Nevertheless, the results are different in comparing first-, second- and later-generation family firms. Originality/value: This is one of the few empirical studies that examine the relationship between family board ownership and firm performance in the context of non-listed family SMEs. The authors consider that the influences of family directors on the board of directors as well as the concentration of family ownership on the board of directors are worth studying in non-listed family SMEs. Moreover, previous studies have focused mainly on large listed family firms but not on unlisted ones. (c) 2019, Amaia Maseda, Txomin Iturralde, Gloria Aparicio, Lotfi Boulkeroua and Sarah Cooper.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to refute the work of Andersen (2017) by suggesting a different theoretical view and to argue that the concept of managerial discretion is one of the core dimensions that cannot be discarded when studying corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses theoretical frameworks from recent literature, definitions and empirical studies on the concept of managerial discretion and corporate governance. Findings: Several studies have empirically tested and measured the concept of managerial discretion, some have provided validity and reliability of the concept and others have showed the direct impact of discretion on firm performance. Practical implications: Research on managerial discretion provides owners and board of directors a clear advice on how much discretion can be granted to top executives by taking into consideration the different dimensions of the external and internal environment. Originality/value: This paper concludes that corporate governance research will not improve if it abandons the concept of managerial discretion. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the effect of political involvement on firm performance in Chinese and cross-country setting. We find that political involvement is negatively correlated with firm performance in China and the negative effect in China is stronger than that in other countries. Cross-sectional tests indicate that the negative effect is not affected by cross-listing, stronger in local Stated Owned enterprises (SOEs) and disappears after the issue of Guiding opinions and Several opinions. Our additional analyses show that the degree of overlapping between members of the Party Committee and directors has a converted U-shape relationship with firm performance. The ratio of Chinese Communist Party members in the board of directors has positive impact on firm performance and political involvement is positively correlated with firm performance in NSOEs.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the association between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance measured by return on assets (ROA). The question is whether an effective corporate governance mechanism is able to increase the firm performance of Bursa and Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Klang Valley, Malaysia. The main purpose of this study is the in-depth analysis of the corporate governance mechanism and construction industry Malaysia via Bursa and CIDB. Design/methodology/approach: Following the primary and secondary data comparative approach, data are collected from 46 listed construction companies and 250 CIDB-registered SMEs for the financial year 2015. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation test are reported, and model estimation is performed using logistic regression. Findings: The empirical outcome shows that the corporate governance mechanism is significant in case of the CIDB Malaysia-registered SMEs. While, it has insignificant impact on firm's performance for Bursa Malaysia. Practical implications: This paper offers evidence specifically for Bursa and CIDB Malaysia construction industry. It can also provide guidance to the board of directors for the subscription of shares under the corporate governance measures at Bursa Malaysia. The findings also suggest that CIDB should increase awareness regarding institutional investment to assist the securities market to develop further. Originality/value: This study gives an indication about corporate governance, specifically for the CIDB-registered SMEs and Bursa Malaysia. It also discusses the matter of firm performance under the light of corporate governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether there is an association between corporate governance and stock price crash risk. A large body of literature reports that a prominent factor of stock crash risk is the managerial tendency of withholding bad news from investors due to compensation contracts and career concerns. This study aims to verify whether good governance structures (characteristics of the board of directors) help restrict these opportunistic managerial behaviors. To test the hypothesis, this study performs the logit and OLS regression model using 3,635 data of listed Korean firms from 2006 to 2015. This research provides a direct evidence for the relationship between stock crash risk and characteristics of governance, particularly the characteristics of the BODs. The findings suggest that irrespective of the size of the board, if there are independent and expert directors' present, corporate governance may have an impact on the reduction of stock price crash risk. This paper contributes by extending the literature on corporate governance. Despite the importance of board compositions, there is no prior research examining the relation between the characteristics of the BOD and stock price crash risk. (c) 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Enterprise information systems (EIS) improve access to information, process optimization and system integration. Such enhanced information processing capabilities have varying effects on firm financial performance under different corporate governance aspects. We examine such interacting effects with data of Chinese listed companies during 2008 and 2013. Our empirical study shows that EIS implementation is associated with higher financial performance when the firm's ownership is more concentrated or the CEO assumes a dual role as the chair of the board of directors. EIS implementation is associated with lower financial performance when the firm is a state-owned enterprise or within a business group. This study contributes to literature in IT business value in general and research in enterprise systems in particular by expanding our understandings about the varying impacts of EIS under different corporate governance aspects.

Drawing on an institutional theoretical perspective, we investigate the impact of the origins of organizational legitimacy on systematic risk using a sample of 358 Brazilian companies between the years 2002 and 2007. We regard three origins of legitimacy--formal-regulatory (presence in premium listings), cultural-cognitive (board of directors), and normative legitimacy (reputation)--to empirically investigate how a company's size and adherence to premium lists moderate other sources of legitimacy. Our results indicate that only under apparently better quality corporate governance conditions--presence in premium listings--do corporate reputation and the board of directors reduce systematic risk. In addition, we show that the effect of reputation on risk is positively moderated by firm size. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC.

Purpose: Some scholars have claimed that CEOs make decisions, while boards of directors control these decisions by applying the concepts of decision management and decision control. These concepts were suggested more than 30 years ago and are still applied in corporate governance research. They are now challenged on the basis of scholarship on corporate governance and management. Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance addresses the authority and responsibility that boards of directors and executives have. Management theory addresses planning and control in corporations. Findings: The relationship between the owners (the boards of directors) and the top managers is hierarchical. This paper concludes that owners or boards of directors make decisions on main and strategic goals. Decisions cannot be controlled, but the implementation and outcomes of plans can. The latter is managers' responsibility. The terms "decision management" and "decision control" are undefined and do not describe what takes place in organizations. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not contain any new empirical data. Originality/value: Management theory offers clear definitions of decisions, decision-making and control. The concepts of decision management (initiation and implementation) and decision control (ratification and monitoring) neither properly describe who makes major and strategic decisions nor how and who controls the consequences of these decisions.

Purpose: Based on 3,775 firm-year observations from 2009 to 2013 using publicly available disclosure data for Korean listed firms, this study examines whether and how firm-level governance characteristics are associated with investment in internal auditing proxied by compensation and the number of statutory internal auditors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate the association between governance characteristics and investment in internal auditing proxied by compensation and the number of statutory internal auditors. Findings: The authors find that firms with greater ownership of the largest shareholders and with a higher proportion of outside directors invest more in internal auditing. These results indicate that firms with higher incentive and demand for monitoring are more likely to invest more in internal auditing. The authors further find that the positive effect of the largest shareholder ownership (board independence) on investment in internal auditing is attenuated in firms with greater board independence (ownership of the largest shareholders) suggesting that the complementary effect of the two governance mechanisms associated with internal auditing weakens as they function simultaneously. Research limitations/implications: The results provide regulators and investors with a clear picture of the governance characteristics of firms associated with investment in internal auditing. The results imply that both the largest shareholders and the outside board of directors play a significant role in resource allocation in internal auditing within a firm. The effect of allocation, however, can be attenuated contingent upon the combined characteristics of governance mechanisms. Originality/value: Using large amounts of public archival data, this study adds to the extant literature on firm characteristics associated with investment in internal auditing. This study also contributes to the literature by expanding the scope of research on executive compensation to the locus of statutory internal auditors. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study investigated the impact of board diversity on the financial performance of listed firms on the Vietnamese stock exchange. Four demographic characteristics of board members (gender, nationality, level of education and level of age) were used as the proxies for diversity. The data were analyzed by different methods including Pooled OLS regression, Fixed Effect Model (FEM), Random Effect Model (REM) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) using a sample of 482 companies listed in the period from 2015 to 2017. The results showed that the percentages of female members, foreign members and members with post-graduate degrees on the board, were statistically associated with improvement in financial performance. However, there was no evidence that the percentage of members under 45 years old on the board affected the performance of listed firms on the Vietnamese stock exchange. (c) 2019 AESS Publications.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

We examine the relation between reserve management and a set of audit committee characteristics of property-liability insurers, using reserve errors as a proxy for reserve management. We find that insurers with three audit committee characteristics have more conservative loss reserve estimations: larger audit committee size and more members with accounting expertise, and more audit committee meetings. Our results also find that three recommendations of the 1999 Blue Ribbon Committee can make corporate audit committees more effective: a minimum audit committee size, a minimum level of accounting expertise, and a minimum number of audit committee meetings. These results were obtained when we controlled for board of director characteristics, firm-specific characteristics, and Sarbanes-Oxley. Some board composition variables (e.g., director ownership) also have an impact on reserve management during our study period. The evidence overall suggests that the audit committee and some board characteristics have an impact on reserve management (earnings management) even in a regulated environment such as the insurance industry.

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

This study aims to analyze the effect of political connection in the board of directors and board of commissioners on tax aggressiveness in the State-Owned Enterprises listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange. The analysis results show that the political connection between the board of directors and the board of commissioners negatively affects tax aggressiveness. It indicates that state-owned enterprises tend to avert tax aggressiveness. The state-owned enterprises which have political connection incline toward the compliance with the prevailing taxation regulation to enhance their image as obedient taxpayers. Although there is a political connection established with the government and parliament, the board of directors and board of commissioners do not take it into their own advantages regarding taxation. That indicates how state-owned enterprises tend to uphold government's work plan in relation with tax revenue. Furthermore, the finding of this research signals the effectiveness of monitoring by the independent commissioner in order to synchronize the interest of the board of directors and the board of commissioner in terms of taxation for the long-term objectives of the company.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of independent directors in reducing firms' information asymmetry. Moreover, the authors enrich this investigation by differentiating the effectiveness of independent directors in an intriguing comparative setting of family vs non-family firms. Family firms are used to represent an interesting environment where controlling insiders (i.e. firms' founding families) have dominant control over corporate decisions. This study addresses the question of whether controlling-insiders dominate independent directors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors manually collect firms' founder information to identify family firm status in a sample of S&P 500 firms. Following a large literature in capital market research, the authors proxy information asymmetry by trading volume, bid-ask spread and price volatility. The authors employ multivariate regression with two-stage least square analysis, instrumental variable method, Heckman selection model and Hausman-Taylor model to address the issue of endogenous selection of board of director and family firm status. Findings: The authors find a negative relation between the board independence and information asymmetry, suggesting independent directors are effective in reducing information asymmetry. Furthermore, the authors find this negative relation is stronger in family firms. These results are robust after controlling for the endogenous issues using various models. Research limitations/implications: Our results suggest that independent directors in family-controlled firms are more successful in reducing information asymmetry than their counterparts in non-family firms. The authors provide direct evidence to support the existing theoretical arguments from Rediker and Seth (1995) and Anderson and Reeb (2004) that founding families and independent boards might be a powerful combination for aligning the interest of insider and diffused shareholders. The findings ease a prevalent concern that the role of independent directors might be compromised in an environment with controlling shareholders, and advocate regulations promoting board independence for various business practices. Originality/value: A number of studies concentrate on the practice of corporate disclosure of firm's performance and governance and how corporate disclosure mitigates information asymmetry (Leuz and Verrecchia, 2000; Ali et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of independent directors in reducing information asymmetry. The research adds to understanding the incentives of board members and supports recent findings that different types of investors have heterogeneous incentives for corporate disclosure (Srinidhi et al., 2014).

The present research article is an attempt to add something new and revalidate the influence of already existing corporate governance dimensions related to the board of directors on listing-day performance of the Indian initial public offering (IPO) firms measured through underpricing. Like other emerging market economies, firms in the Indian economy are also characterized by concentrated ownership held by an owner or a promoter in the context of the Indian corporate environment. In the backdrop of this concentrated complex ownership structure, the present study analyses the influence of the board of directors on underpricing when the appointment of such directors is largely an affair handled by such owners, whom they are given the task to monitor. The sample consists of 471 IPO firms which went public during the time period from January 2003 to December 2017. Results obtained from the regression analysis show that the board size and board committees act as information signals for Indian IPO firms having a significant and negative relation with listing-day initial excess returns. Other board-related dimensions of governance do not have significant influence on underpricing. Overall board variables have a very miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing in Indian IPO firms. (c) 2019 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance among state-owned enterprise (SOE) in Malaysia. In addition, we examine whether board size and government's role moderate the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance in SOE. Using panel data regression model on 118 firm-year observations of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia from 2011 to 2013, this study finds there is positive relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance. The result provides supports that directors' remuneration acts as incentive to board of directors to perform their monitoring task. The result also indicates that larger board size and government play an important role in enhancing firm performance of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia. Nevertheless, when we interact both variables with directors' remuneration, the result indicates that larger board size and political connected directors moderate the positive relationship between firm performance and directors' remuneration. Our result provides evidence that the interaction between directors' remuneration and board size as well as political connected directors explain firm performance among state owned enterprise in Malaysia.

This study considers the effect of foreign board members and age diversity on real earnings management (REM), by controlling the firm size, leverage and growth. This study employed quantitative methodology and longitudinal data for non-financial business firms, quoted on the Amman Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2015. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) regression. This study found that foreign boards member, age diversity, leverage and growth had negative and significant associations with REM. Based on the results, a firm should appoint young members to the board in addition to older members to pave the way to cross-ideology that can deter REM activities. At least one foreign director should exist within the board of directors because a foreign board member has different qualifications and experiences that may help to deter REM practices.

In this article, I investigate the effect of multiple directorships on investment efficiency. Through the study of Korean firms, this article confirms that the existence and proportion of multiple directorships were negatively related to investment efficiency. The study also found that multiple directorships were strongly related to underinvestment. Accordingly, it concludes that multiple directorships are an obstacle to directors' fulfillment as it impedes effective investment opportunities and prevents them from playing leading roles in managerial decision-making. This, in turn, affects investment efficiency negatively. (c) 2019, People and Global Business Association. All rights reserved.

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how investor sentiment, proxied by Michigan consumer confidence index, affects the choice of defined benefit pension plan discount rates. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use multivariate analysis to test our hypotheses. The dependent variable is defined pension plan discount rate and the testing variables are investor sentiment and a dummy variable representing underfunded status. Findings: The authors find a negative and significant relation between investor sentiment and pension plan discount rate. During high (low) sentiment periods, pension discount rate tends to be adjusted downward (upward) discretionarily. Further analysis indicates the relationship between pension discount rate and investor sentiment is more pronounced for firms with underfunded pension plans. The results can be explained by limited attention effects, capital budgeting strategy and earning smoothing. Practical implications: The empirical results of this study have important implications for corporate governance and regulation. Specifically, the results suggest the need for increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to reported pension liabilities, especially during periods of high investor sentiment when pension plan sponsors are more likely to adjust down pension discount rate and accordingly to increase pension liabilities. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the extant literature by identifying investor sentiment as a new incentive of pension discount rate manipulation. The empirical results of this study also have important implications for corporate governance and regulation. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The objective of this paper is to provide an assessment of corporate governance in selected financial institutions in Barbados. The instrument used for measuring corporate governance practice is derived from the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) Corporate Governance Guidelines (2013) and the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 2004). A corporate governance index is developed to best fit the domestic financial system. The results indicate that the five financial institutions are highly compliant with the corporate governance guidelines. The corporate governance index ranges from 75 to 92 on a scale of 0 to 100 in ascending order of good corporate governance. Commercial banks obtained the highest corporate governance rankings. This result is not surprising since the banks operating in Barbados are affiliates of foreign-owned and domiciled financial institutions. They are therefore monitored by multiple local, regional and international regulatory agencies. This paper is the first such research effort for the Barbadian economy. The findings should be beneficial to many persons, including top management (CEO, Chairman, Board of Directors), shareholders and other stakeholders, regulators and future researchers.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates, in the Brazilian capital market, the effect of the composition of the board of directors on executive compensation sensitivity to market performance, known as pay-performance sensitivity (PPS). Due to potential agency conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders and between shareholders and managers, members of the board of directors of the executive board or those appointed by the controlling shareholder might have less independence, something which may compromise monitoring effectiveness and, consequently, reduce the PPS. The purpose is contributing to understand the agency conflicts that have taken place in the Brazilian capital market and to define the configuration of the monitoring and compensation mechanisms that minimize total agency costs, maximizing shareholders' wealth. The research results have implications for understanding the agency relations and for corporate governance in the Brazilian capital market. It is concluded that the relation between the monitoring exercised by the board of directors and executive compensation is a condition for its effectiveness as a governance mechanism in the Brazilian capital market. Data within the period 2013-2015 from 92 companies that participate in the Brazil 100 Index (IBRX 100) of the Sao Paulo Stock, Mercantile & Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) were analyzed. In addition to tests of difference between mean values and correlation, estimates were processed through feasible generalized least squares modeling. The independence of the board of directors vis-a-vis the controlling shareholder and the executive board may work as a corporate governance mechanism supplementing executive compensation. The results of this study indicate that the proportion of executives and independent members in the board of directors reduces the PPS, a measurement for executive compensation effectiveness made operational by the contemporary relation between increased managers' compensation and increased company's market value.

Following a stakeholder corporate governance perspective, we examine whether the characteristics of boards of directors (board size, separation of Chairman and CEO roles, independent directors and board ownership) have an impact on the value-added distribution to stakeholders, who are differentiated as shareholders and other primary stakeholders (workers, creditors and government), and if these characteristics could contribute to a more equitable distribution of the value added. Considering that the main concern of the primary stakeholders is the distribution of wealth, we focus our approaches on the value-added distribution as a proxy for the primary stakeholders interests. We conduct a panel data analysis of 438 observations of Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2012 and test various models that offer new insights into stakeholder perspectives. The results show that within the context of ownership concentration and with a unitary board system of corporate governance, the incorporation of independent directors on the Board and the separation of power (between Chairman and CEO) are important corporate control mechanisms with which to defend the interests of other primary stakeholders (workers, creditors and government). In addition, the results highlight that regulators and shareholders should be wary of excessive board ownership and oversized boards, as these may contribute to exacerbating the conflict of interests between shareholders and other primary stakeholders. These results contribute to the debate concerning the dichotomized approach of corporate governance (shareholders/stakeholders corporate governance).

This paper examines the effect of industry-wide factors such as product market competition on corporate tax avoidance. Specifically, the focus is on the moderating role of corporate governance in the relationship between product market competition and tax avoidance. To conduct an empirical analysis, a sample of public companies that are listed on the Korea Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2016 is used. The empirical analyses provide the following results. First, product market competition is negatively related to tax avoidance. This suggests that competitive markets act as external corporate governance mechanisms and discipline managers to decrease tax avoidance. Second, the negative association between product market competition and tax avoidance is more pronounced for firms with more independent board of directors and firms with audit committee consisting of outside directors. These findings imply that product market competition acts more effectively when the firm has strong internal governance mechanisms such as board independence and audit committee independence. Therefore, we provide evidence on a complementary relationship between internal governance system and product market competition. The results may be of interest to policy makers and regulators like Korea Fair Trade Commission and Financial Supervisory Service who are involved in promoting market competition, monitoring any abuse of market dominance, and supervising financial reporting quality.

Purpose: The existence of controlling shareholders creates a remarkable difference between the corporate governance structures of Chinese firms and those of western firms. Despite the increasing importance of controlling shareholders, it remains disputable whether they are playing the "tunneling" roles or the "governance" roles. Therefore, more research is needed on what roles controlling shareholders are playing and how they play their roles. Previous empirical studies document a common phenomenon that directors play dual roles both on the board and in the top management team. Because of information asymmetry, the board of directors may not be able to perform its supervisory and strategic decision-making functions. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate whether controlling shareholders participate in firm management by appointing the executive directors and examine the economic consequences of controlling shareholder involvement. Design/methodology/approach: In the empirical tests, the authors use the split share structure reform in China as a natural experiment. Using the data from Chinese listed firms between 2001 and 2015 and difference-in-differences analysis, the authors examine the impact of the split share structure reform on the executive directors of controlling shareholders and the governance effect of controlling shareholders' appointing executive directors to the management. Findings: The authors find that controlling shareholders get involved in firm management by appointing executive directors to strengthen the supervision and incentives of managers. The authors also find that firms exhibit a lower level of earnings management and enhance and higher pay-performance sensitivity after controlling shareholders appoint executive directors to the top management team. Originality/value: As the natural experiment of the split share structure reform enables us to mitigate endogeneity, the authors investigate the channels through, which controlling shareholders get involved in firm management from the unique perspective of executive director appointment. The study expands the literature on corporate governance and board functions. The findings provide new insights to the effect of controlling shareholder governance and casts light on a new way for controlling shareholders of Chinese firms to participate in firm management - by appointing executive directors.

The paper illustrates the models of corporate governance in the aspects of its definition, nature of management and objectives along with its roles, regulation and power of various stakeholders in ensuring the accountability and the protection of the rights of various stakeholders from conventional and Islamic perspectives. These models are different in their characteristics, nature, culture, costume, epistemology, and country?s rules and regulation. However, the conventional models highlight the roles of shareholders, stakeholders, depositors, institutions, investors, and communities from the perspective of the nation?s demand and cultures. In contrast, the Islamic model of corporate governance consists of some roles and responsibilities such as the responsibilities to suppliers, customers, investment account holders, shareholders, management, the board of directors, competitors, Shariah supervisory boards, societies, and the employees from its spiritual and social commitments. Through the critical analysis of these models of corporate governance is deemed to help the empirical research on corporate governance model and develop a certain model of Islamic corporate governance. However, the paper may help to give a simple understanding of the corporate governance models in both the conventional and Islamic perspectives of financial institutions. (c) 2019 Conscientia Beam.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

This study aims to investigate the level of compliance with CG mechanisms and accountability in Libyan listed companies. It adopts a qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect the required data from two broad stakeholder groups: internal stakeholders (ISG) and external stakeholders (ESG). The findings of this study provide evidence that Libyan listed companies are to some extent committed to implementing CG mechanisms, but that CG and accountability practices are still at an early stage of development in the country and there are significant weaknesses in terms of practice. Listed companies' commitment is most evident in their adherence to the BoD mechanism, but levels of disclosure and transparency are barely satisfactory; interviewees argued that at present, disclosure and transparency practices in Libya are designed only to meet local, not international, requirements. Listed companies have also taken practical steps towards meeting the LCGC's requirements regarding the internal and external audit mechanisms, but the general view among ISG and ESG interviewees was that these mechanisms are currently not robust enough to ensure strong internal control systems. Finally, in terms of the shareholders' rights mechanism, majority shareholders are seen to enjoy much greater protection, both legally and in practice, than minority shareholders. The results of the study reveal that the lack of knowledge and awareness about the concept of CG, the weakness of the Libyan legislative environment and the lack of accountability mechanisms are the most significant factors inhibiting the advance of CG in the Libyan environment. This study helps to enrich our understanding and knowledge of current CG and accountability practices by being the first to investigate CG mechanisms and accountability in Libyan listed companies.

The corporate governance is a mechanism to protect investors in the markets around the world. This study analyses the board of directors' specificities in the context of Portuguese Corporate Governance, and study the corporate governance effect of Portuguese listed firms on firm performance. The results show that the Latin Model (Two-Tier Model) is the most (least) adopted by Portuguese firms. The percentage of executive members is higher than that of non-executive members. In the year of 2014, women held only 9.5% of positions on board, which is very low. The results concerning the relationship between corporate governance and firms' performance are not consensual. Although some studies find evidence of a positive relation between the two variables, others find no relationship. With this study, we contribute to the state of art of corporate governance in a country which investigation is still scarce. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Recently, accounting scandals have raised considerable concern among regulators, and accounting professionals about related party transaction in Korea. According to prior research, related party transactions could be used as a source of earning management. This study examines whether there is an association between related party transaction that allegedly are used to manipulate earnings and corporate governance, particularly focusing on the characteristics of board of directors. The purpose of this paper is also to investigate whether good governance structures (characteristics of board of directors) help constrain management opportunistic behavior in Korean listed firms. The characteristics of board of directors are measured by size, independence, expertise and activity. This paper provides evidence that independence and expertise of the board of directors are associated with lower related party transactions. These results suggest that board of directors play a significant role in monitoring transactions between related parties, in turn, reducing effectively these dealings.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

Good corporate governance practices are regarded as important in reducing risk for investors, attracting investment capital and improving the performance of companies. This paper investigates the relationship between corporate governance practices of the board of directors and firm performance of Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO), a large insurance company which collapsed in Barbados, and caused significant financial losses to policyholders. Using a case study approach, we used information from publicly available documents via print media and the internet to research the corporate governance practices and performance of CLICO. Findings reveal that the collapse of CLICO was a result of poor corporate governance mechanisms including lack of board independence, CEO and Chairman dual relationship, poor regulatory environment, non-functioning sub-committees, failure to manage risks, interlocking directorship, political involvement and lack of diversity. Recommendations include effective regulation, separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman, reduced political interference and more diversity. (c) 2019 The Authors.

This work aims to study whether the compliance with the recommendations contained in Corporate Governance Codes contributes to environmental, social and corporate governance disclosure practices. The results fail to show a relationship between the global compliance with the recommendations of the codes and the environmental, social and governance disclosures. However, the compliance with the recommendations regarding the board of directors positively influences the voluntary disclosure of this type of information. This evidence contributes to the debate on the role of Corporate Governance Codes and has direct implications for companies and regulators when designing corporate governance mechanisms.

Corporate governance can mitigate risk and contribute to the continuity of the family business. This is due to the supervision exercised over the activities of the management, facilitating the balance of the achievement of both short-term and long-term interests. In Mexico, the research on the insolvency risk (Altman's Z-score modified index) in the family business is practically non-existent. Therefore, the present exploratory work is interested in determining the relationship between the control mechanisms of corporate governance and the insolvency risk of family businesses quoted during the 2012-2016 period. The analysis of the information has been made through the Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) model. The results advocate that the size of the board of directors, significantly influences a greater probability (lower Altman's Z-score modified index) of incurring insolvency risk, and differentiation by sector.

After the equity division reform, the willingness of paper industry's listed companies to issue cash dividends has been continuously enhanced. Cash dividends have been widely distributed. Some listed companies have issued small cash dividends, while some listed companies have paid dividends at a high level. This article focuses on the effect of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on the cash dividend policy, and examines the influence of ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on cash dividend policy under the Regulation of the board characteristics. The empirical research shows: (1) The ultimate controlling shareholder's cash flow rights are negatively related to the cash dividend policy, and to a degree, U-nonlinear curve relationship; the control rights and the cash dividend policy are significantly positively correlated; the two rights separation and the cash dividends policy is significantly positively related. This shows that the cash dividend policy is not only a tool for the ultimate controlling shareholder to tunnel, but also a mask to cover up tunneling. (2) The shareholding balance between the second largest shareholder and the tenth largest shareholder is difficult to counterbalance the concealed short selling behavior of the ultimate controlling shareholder. (3) The ceo duality can enhance the influence of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on the cash dividend policy. (4) The independence of the board of directors significantly reduced the influence of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on the cash dividend policy. The research conclusions of this paper provide new evidence for the research on the influencing factors of cash dividend policy. (c) 2019, SHPMedia Sdn Bhd. All rights reserved.

After the share structure reform, the ultimate controlling shareholder of paper industry's listed companies adopts more subtle earnings management in conjunction with its tunneling, the level of earnings management is slightly higher than that of the equity division. This article focuses on the impact of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on earnings management, and examines the influence of ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on earnings management under the Regulation the of the board characteristics. Empirical research shows: (1) Cash flow rights are negatively related to earnings management, and present a U-shaped non-linear curve relationship at a degree, presenting the"incentive-barrier"effect. Pyramid shares provide a natural barrier to ultimate controlling shareholder earnings management. (2) From the second largest shareholder to the tenth largest shareholder, it is difficult to counterbalance the hidden earnings management actions of the ultimate controlling shareholder, and it is also possible to collude with the ultimate controlling shareholder. (3) The ceo duality can enhance the influence of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on earnings management. (4) Under the regulation of the independence of the board of directors, the influence of the ultimate controlling shareholder characteristics on earnings management has weakened. The research conclusions of this paper provide new evidence for the research on the influencing factors of earnings management. (c) 2019, SHPMedia Sdn Bhd. All rights reserved.

The study aims to determine how different factors shape the size of boards of directors in private firms conducting an initial public offering (IPO) on the regulated Euronext Paris market. These factors include the presence of a venture capitalist, ownership structure, firm-specific characteristics and CEO characteristics. To study the determinants of board size, we used a sample of 568 firms that went public from 1995 to 2012 and found that the boards tend to become more independent shortly after going public, which indicates that firms are affected by monitoring in financial markets. The study found strong evidence that ownership variables, board structure variables, CEO characteristic variables and firm characteristic variables tend to affect board size. Our results also indicate that venture capitalists are a major catalyst for IPOs because they provide financing and strategic advice, act as an opposing force to the CEO and shape the governance structure.

This paper examines how the ownership structure and board of directors' features determine the managerial opportunistic behavior exemplified in the management of accounting earnings. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship of firm-level and country-level corporate governance systems on the earnings management in the Spanish corporate sector. Results reveal that the varying efficiency of the corporate governance systems is reflected in the way in which accounting discretion is performed. We found evidence that earnings management is reduced as the voting rights of the controlling shareholder increased and that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between insiders' ownership and the earnings manipulation. Regarding the board characteristics, we observe that larger, independent boards, those with a larger proportion of female members, and those with an audit committee compounded by a greater proportion of outside independent directors oversee managers more efficiently, constraining their capacity to manage earnings. To the contrary, board duality increases the likelihood of opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting. We found that when the institutional environment improves in the Spanish context, the discretionary power of the corporate sector to overstate the financial statements is reduced. The findings prove the necessity of reinforcing the rules and regulations toward a more transparent disclosure of the financial statements. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of corporate board and audit committee characteristics and ownership structures on market-based financial performance of listed firms in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: It applies system GMM (generalized method of moments) as the baseline estimator approach, and ordinary least squares and fixed effects for robustness checks on a sample of 452 firms listed on the Thai Stock Exchange for the period 2000-2016. Findings: Relying mainly on the system GMM estimator, the empirical results indicate some emerging trends in the Thai economy. Contrary to expectations for an emerging market and prior research findings, ownership structures, particularly ownership concentration and family ownership, appear to have no significant influence on market-based firm performance, while managerial ownership exerts a positive effect on performance. Moreover, as expected, board structure variables such as board independence; size; meeting and dual role; and audit committee meeting show significant explanatory power on market-based firm performance in Thai firms. Practical implications: These findings are important for policymakers in constructing an appropriate set of governance mechanisms in an emerging market context, and for corporate entities and investors in shaping their understanding of corporate governance in the Thai institutional context. Originality/value: Unlike previous literature on the Thai market, this study is the first to use the more advanced econometric method known as system GMM estimator for addressing causality/endogeneity issues in governance-performance relationships. The findings indicate new trends in the explanatory power of ownership structure variables on market-based firm performance in Thai-listed firms. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Drawing on the complexity theory and responding to the recent calls to use such creative methods that mix between a quantitative and qualitative approach. Therefore, this study fills the literature gap, adding novelties, showing evidence from the unexplored (or underexplored) European context and, consequently, shedding light to inconclusive results in previous research concerning the effect of audit committee (AC) and board characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure by applying a novel research methodology: the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. The data were collected from Eikon database for a sample of the top 69 non-financial European companies (based on market capitalisation) for the period 2016-2018. The study results support the equifinality and complexity tenets of complexity theory. It also suggests that CSR disclosure relies on a complex configuration of some AC attributes, for example, independence, financial expert member, chair independence, size and activity, and other board characteristics (independence, gender, size, activity, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality). These characteristics play a leading part as a recipe ingredient and, in an appropriate combination, promote achieving high CSR disclosure levels. Our empirical results offer multidimensional and valuable insights for professionals, regulators, and policymakers in establishing and revising the guidelines regarding the AC and board of directors' composition.

This study examines the difference between high and low concentrated markets in using accrual and real earnings management and the role of corporate governance in mitigating such activities across the two types of markets. We find that firms operating in concentrated markets use more accrual and real earnings management compared to those in non-concentrated markets. Furthermore, we find evidence that corporate governance, in the form of quality board characteristics, is more effective in mitigating earnings management in non-concentrated markets. In contrast, corporate governance in concentrated markets drives managers to substitute accrual with real earnings management as the latter is less easily detectable and its long-term negative consequences on firm value are likely to be mitigated by the higher competitive power of firms in concentrated markets. The findings of this study are potentially useful to regulators in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in concentrated markets. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

We test for a link between CEO power and risk taking in US banks. Banks are more likely to take risks if they have powerful CEOs and relatively poor balance sheets. There is little evidence that executive board size and independence have a dampening effect on the channels through which powerful CEOs influence risk-taking and some evidence that institutional investors reinforce the risk-taking preferences of powerful CEOs.

This paper presents a methodological framework for constructing a non-parametric index of corporate governance for banks. The index is constructed by aggregating six distinct dimensional indices capturing different dimensions of corporate governance, namely board effectiveness, audit function, risk management, remuneration, shareholder rights and information, and disclosure and transparency. For aggregation, a tailored version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach which is popularly known as constrained 'Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD)' model is employed. This approach is unique and distinctive in the sense that it requires no a priori knowledge of weights, and assigns endogenous weights obtained from actual data to individual dimensions of bank governance in order to construct a composite index of corporate governance. This methodological framework has illustrated by applying it for a data set of 40 Indian banks operating in the year 2017. The data set has been compiled using 58 governance regulations as defined by relevant jurisdictions. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

This paper examines the influence of the size of firms' board of directors on corporate social performance through a meta-analytic perspective. To that end, a sample of 80 articles that draw on evidence from more than 80,000 international companies, published between 1997 and 2018, was examined. This paper analyzes the moderating effect of a set of corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition and corporate governance systems on the hypothesized relationship between the size of firms' board and corporate social performance. Our central results reveal that larger and more independent boards better represent stakeholders' sensitivities and allow companies to achieve their social objectives. Moreover, that connection is more positive and stronger in companies with more independent boards and in countries that have codified law, which often have fewer mechanisms to protect shareholders' interests.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

Business and politics are now more connected than ever. In Canada, more than 50% of listed companies have political connections through the board of directors or top management. These ties can give companies the resources they need to achieve their goals and possibly even confer a substantial advantage that results in better financial performance. To this end, political connections must influence the various choices and behaviours of politically connected companies, such as their voluntary disclosure strategy. As this type of influence has rarely been investigated in the literature, the current study looks at the impact of board and top management political connections on the voluntary disclosure behaviour of Canadian firms. Four types of voluntary disclosure--environmental, social, governance and total--are analyzed. Results show that politically connected companies make broader voluntary disclosures than non-connected firms do. Board and top management political connections are positively and significantly related to total voluntary disclosure, and board political connections are positively and significantly related to governance disclosures. In addition, top management political connections are positively and significantly related to voluntary environmental and social disclosures. This study is the first to shed light on the link between political connections and the voluntary disclosure of Canadian listed companies, as well as the first to confirm that not all political connections are equal. The impact of these connections on companies' choices and behaviours can differs according to the politically connected actor's position in the company, including on the board of directors or in top management. This difference could be explained by the fact that while board are generally concerned about strategic issues, top management deal with operational aspects. Consequently, they may not have the same behaviours and choices. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether female directors have an effect on company financial performance in a patriarchal emerging country that has a collectivistic culture with a substantial gender equality gap and is characterized with a paternalistic management culture. In addition, it aims to investigate whether the affiliations of female directors matter performance-wise in a setting where the majority of the companies are ultimately controlled by large business groups including families. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a unique hand-collected data set that covers all non-financial public companies quoted at the Borsa Istanbul between the years 2009 and 2017. To investigate the relationships between the presence and ratio of female directors and company financial performance, the current study uses the pooled ordinary least squares method, as well as the firm-fixed effects method to overcome potential omitted variables problems and various generalized method of moments methods to overcome potential reverse causality problems. Findings: The findings of the current study demonstrate that the presence and percentage of female directors both have a positive effect on company financial performance in a cultural setting where the opposite might be expected. They also present evidence suggesting that the effect becomes larger as the level of the independence of female directors becomes greater. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates that the presence of female directors on boards has a positive effect on company financial performance, even in a cultural setting that is very different from those of countries where the majority of previous studies on female directors are conducted on. In addition, it demonstrates how company financial performance varies with the level of the affiliation of female directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This work seeks to contribute to the debate about whether or not family businesses are more innovative than other kind of companies, and explore the specific effects women on boards have on innovation, comparing family and non-family businesses. Data collected from Spanish listed companies belonging to innovative sectors between 2003 and 2017 confirm that being a family business impacts positively on the number of registered patents and the proportion of women on boards exert a positive influence on R&D and patents. Moreover, the proportion of women on boards influences innovation in a different way when family and non-family businesses are compared, and depending on whether female directors belong or not to the family of control. Therefore, the results obtained suggest some relevant recommendations for research and practitioners, providing new insights into the debate on the benefits of family companies for innovation and of gender diversity of their boards.

This study aims to investigate the direct relationship between ownership structure, earnings manipulation, and organizational performance, andthen examine the mediating effect of earnings manipulation in the relationship between ownership structure and organizational performance.This study collected and analyzed secondary data published in financial reports related to all insurance organizations listed in the Jordanianmarket during the study period (from 2009 until 2018). A panel data analysis was conducted, giving a total of 200 observations. The findingsof this study concluded that ownership concentration, foreign ownership, and organization size affect organizational performance proxied byROA, ROE, and EPS, more specifically, ownership concentration and organization size have a positive effect, whereas foreign ownership has anegative effect. At the same time, board of director ownership, organizational ownership, and CEO compensation did not affect organizationalperformance. Next, the board of director ownership, ownership concentration, foreign ownership, and CEO compensation affect earningsmanipulation separately. In addition, earnings manipulation positively affects organizational performance proxied by ROA, ROE and EPS.This means that the higher the earnings manipulation is, the higher the organizational performance is. Finally, earnings manipulation mediatesthe relationship between ownership concentration and foreign ownership of ownership structure, and organizational performance. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the impact of corporate governance on performance of sugar mills. In order to study this relation, a model is constructed in which ownership structure and independent directors are taken as independent variables. Whereas firm performance is analyzed by using proxy variables such as return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and sales growth. Moreover, size of board, working capital management (WCM) and philanthropy are taken as mediating variables between governance variables and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The data of 32 sugar mills listed at Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period of four years (i.e. 2014-2017) is used for this research. Moreover, to investigate the model, generalized least squares statistical method is used to measure the relationship between variables. Findings: The results revealed that there is significant but positive relationship between independent directors and ROA while ownership structure and ROE have significant but negative relationship. Thus, the board of directors should make it sure that all stakeholders and organizations should increase the nonfamily ownership in firms for better corporate performance. Moreover, philanthropy and WCM mediate the relationship between corporate governance and firms' performance. Practical/implications: This research work will be helpful in the corporate governance, and further researchers can conduct their study by considering executive/nonexecutive director and institutional owners as governance variables. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study how Corporate Governance effect the performance of firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how ownership concentration affects cost of debt (CoD) in one of the most important emerging markets in the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs panel data analysis using non-financial firms listed on Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE) between 2004 and 2016. To unveil the hidden facets of the relationship between ownership concentration and CoD, and examine if this relationship changes with market conditions, we conduct a pre-post-crisis analysis. Findings: The results demonstrate that controlling shareholders promote decent governance as long as they are able to generate appropriate returns. However, this behavior seems to change during the post-crisis period. In their attempts to increase their returns adversely affected by the financial crisis, controlling shareholders switch from guardians of decent governance and firm's resources to a menace to creditors' interests. Practical implications: Our results expose the severity of agency problems in CSE. It is the duty of all market participants including regulators, board of directors, financial analysts, shareholders and creditors to scrutiny and reinforce governance mechanisms to alleviate expropriation by controlling shareholders. Improving country and firm-level governance mechanisms would enhance investors' protection, attract international investors and boost the economic activity. Originality/value: Prior research is inconclusive about the impact of ownership concentration on CoD. Hence, it is worthwhile to seek new evidence in a new market on the nature of this relationship.

The direction of the mixed ownership reform is changing from managed assets to managed capital. Perfecting the corporate governance structure plays an important role in promoting the reform of mixed ownership, and then improving the state-owned and private capital returns. To explore the existence of current, long-term and structural impact of corporate governance capacity of mixed-ownership enterprises on capital gains, the index system for measuring corporate governance ability of mixed-ownership enterprises was constructed from comprehensive index, internal and external governance ability index. The influencing mechanism was analysed by using the data of 92 mixed-ownership enterprises in China from 2014 to 2015. Results show that the improvement of corporate governance ability can promote Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) of mixed-ownership enterprises, and both have long-term but different effects. Internal and external governance ability both has a positive impact on Tobin's Q and ROA currently and in long-term. External governance ability has a more significant impact on Tobin's Q. Structural impact of internal governance ability on capital gains is different. Both governance ability of the board of directors and management have a positive effect on capital gains. Governance ability of the board of shareholders does not contribute to capital gains, while governance ability of the board of supervisors is not related to capital gains. In addition, corporate governance ability of mixed-ownership enterprises in emerging industries has a stronger impact on capital gains than traditional industries. The conclusions obtained in the study provide theoretical reference and decision basis for the improvement of corporate governance ability and capital gains of mixed-ownership enterprises.

This study aims at investigating the associations of board of directors' size, board of directors' meetings, firm size and firm leverage with firm performance among energy industry in Saudi Arabia for periods ranging from 2005 to 2018. The final sample in this study consists of 56 observations. The ordinary-least square regression shows that board size is associated positively with firm performance. Further, the results of this study repot that board meetings, firm size and firm leverage are associated negatively with firm performance in the context of Saudi Arabia. The results of this study are important for policy makers at the country and corporate levels on issues related to corporate performance. Further, the results of this study can be used in future research to gain a deeper understanding of the issues of corporate performance. (c) 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This paper aims at discovering a sustainable corporate governance approach by analysing the interaction between the board of directors and the application of corporate corruption legislation by Spanish companies. Thus, the objective of this paper is to define the role of the board of directors in corporate corruption prevention activities. Based on a case study using the Gioia methodology, our research seeks to identify the role of the board of directors compared with that of control activities (i.e., corruption prevention activities) within the management system of the company. Thus, this study sheds light on the role of Board of Directors in the implementation of corporate corruption prevention in accordance with the anticorruption Spanish legislation (Organic Law 1/2015) as well as corporate responsibility and related compliance programs adopted by companies. Our findings are original in defining sustainable corporate governance as a means of preventing corruption and safeguarding corporate sustainability. The debate on corporate sustainability in the economic systems of several states is the point of departure for this study, which analyses characteristics of anticorruption models of the Spanish companies, offering a framework for further research on sustainable corporate governance and corporate sustainability.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Purpose: Responding to the call for research into the behavior of family companies to provide better understanding of corporate governance, this paper aims to examine the impact of boards' effectiveness on the investment in monitoring costs (i.e. audit fees, internal audit function budget and executive remuneration) and how this relationship is moderated by family control. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 2,176 firm-year observations of Malaysian listed companies is used. The ordinary least square regression is used to examine the associations. Additional sensitivity tests are performed. Findings: The study finds that there is no relationship between boards' effectiveness and the demand for monitoring costs for the full sample. However, the findings of sub-samples (family and non-family companies) indicate that a family company with an effective board is less likely to invest more in monitoring, suggesting that the complementary association between the board's effectiveness and investment in monitoring is a more dominant relationship than the substitution relationship in non-family companies. These findings show that the boards of directors of Malaysian family companies perform a deficient monitoring role, where the presence of family controlling shareholders in management may reduce their independence and efficiency in performing their monitoring role. The findings remain robust after performing additional sensitivity tests. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance in a unique setting (family companies), where conflict of interest is created between controlling insiders and minority shareholders (Type II agency problem). It provides insight for Malaysian policymakers in assessing the issue of expropriation in family companies and enhancing the policy related to its boards. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show that social relations in a corporate governance platform between members of supervisory boards and between members of supervisory and executive board tiers can serve as an alternative viewpoint for understanding mechanisms of social selection in corporate governance networks. The study shows that through the lenses of social network analysis, it is possible to identify and understand how the process of corporate governance member selection unfolds within companies and how that selection process may have been potentially influenced by the cross-board relations, such as interlocking directorships. Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the differential impact on the stock market of statements made by and information about directors and companies who are politically connected, compared to directors and companies with no political connections. The authors also analyze the role played by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which the authors have identified as politically connected companies because most board members are appointed by political authorities. Furthermore, the boundaries and institutional environment within which SOEs operate are likely to be different from private companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is composed of over 60,000 news articles on the boards of directors (both with political roles and without political roles) of listed Italian companies in the period 1998-2013. On that sample the authors run a regression analysis under the signaling theory approach. Findings: Results suggest a positive effect on market capitalization associated with individual political connections. This effect decreases when the political connection extends to the whole enterprise although it still remains, while a negative effect is associated with state-controlled enterprises. The impact of negative news content does not change depending on whether a board member has a political role or not. Originality/value: Previous research has demonstrated a causal link between stock prices and their reaction to corporate news (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011; Peress, 2014), but no studies have quantified the different reactions that occur when the news mentions politically connected companies and individuals who hold a political role.

This paper aims to provide a review concept regarding the relationship between corporate governance and corporate sustainability in Indonesia. This paper examines the mechanisms and guidelines for implementing good corporate governance. This research used the literature review method and explores some effective corporate governance principles such as transparency, accountability, responsibility, independence, fairness, and equality to achieve business sustainability in Indonesia's setting. The results show that good corporate governance regulation in Indonesia has been improved, but the enforcement is still needed to be optimized because good corporate governance will positively impact corporate sustainability. Thus, sustainability requires more corporate innovation because sustainability is about how a company can create profits and value-added to society through corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and how the company can contribute to the preservation of nature and the environment. In Indonesia, the board of directors, the board of commissioners, and the audit committees are positively related to CSR disclosure. Thus, leadership and management efforts are crucial. However, to comprehensively support the synergy of implementing good corporate governance, we need the role of the state, the business community, and society. This study provides important insights into the implementation of good corporate governance in achieving corporate sustainability in Indonesia. (c) 2020. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates whether firms with more effective boards have lower firm risk. We show a strong negative relationship between board effectiveness (BSCI ratings) and firm risk. Furthermore, we show that several individual components of board effectiveness are negative and statistically related to firm risk. In particular, board independence, board structure, board system and board decision-making lead to lower firm risk. Our findings have implications for firms' costs of capital that is, effective boards are likely to result in a reduction of agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control and in turn, a reduction in the overall cost of capital for firms.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore how the characteristics of the board of directors (BoD) shape earnings and book value information available to market participants. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigated the impact of board size, presence of non-executives and role duality as proxies of effective corporate governance on the value relevance of financial reporting for 178 firms on the Kuwait stock exchange in 2013. Regression analysis based on Ohlson's (1995) valuation model was used to test hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size was significantly associated with company value and that Kuwaiti firms with large boards increased the value-relevance of earnings and book value. The influence of role duality was positive although not significant. The presence of non-executives on the board had a negative correlation with market value (not significant). Research limitations/implications: These findings deliver empirical support for the prediction that the characteristics of the BoD improve the value relevance of financial reporting. Limitations such as small sample size and one-year duration of the study did not negate the basic findings, however. Future studies will use larger samples, longer duration and additional board characteristics. Practical implications: This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that board size influences market valuation. This study may benefit managers, investors and other decision-makers. Originality/value: This study delivers empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on the value relevance of accounting information. It will be useful for regulators and market participants monitoring the influence of board characteristics on the value relevance of accounting information. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine various factors affecting the pricing of audit services and the selection of auditors in the Indian audit market. This paper also aims to investigate the impact of financial distress conditions on the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm, particularly in the context of a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 22,644 firm-years for 1,366 Indian firms from 1990 to 2015. The authors adopt ordinary least squares regression technique to model audit fee, and logistic regression technique to model auditor choice as a function of various factors relating to firm attributes and auditor characteristics. Findings: This paper finds that auditors tend to charge an audit fee premium when they are affiliated to a Big 4 auditor, have industry specialization or jointly provide auditing and non-auditing services. Additionally, firms with larger boards, higher proportion of independent board of directors and CEO-Chairman separation are more likely to choose a Big 4-affiliated auditor. The results also suggest that financially distressed firms tend to pay significantly lower audit fees and are more likely to choose non-Big 4 auditors. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies which investigate how financial distress impacts the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm in the context of emerging economies. The findings of this paper raises serious concerns about the credibility of the audited financial statements and corporate governance mechanisms of firms undergoing financial distress. The empirical results of this paper have strong implications for practitioners, regulators and investors. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

High-growth firm is the research object of economic and business studies, because of its important influence on job creation, innovation, and tax revenues increase for the nation. This paper is designed to find some empirical evidence on the role of corporate governance on the firm's growth, thereby providing some policy implications for improving corporate governance activities in practice. Using a sample of 241 listed companies on Vietnam's stock market in the period 2008-2017, divided into 2 groups: high-growth firms and non-high-growth firms and applying a GMM regression with the dependent variable as 3-year compound growth rate, the study finds evidence of factors affecting the growing ability of corporate governance, namely: the ownership structure, the characteristics of the Board of Directors (size, independence, gender, non-executive member, experience), and the characteristics of the CEO (age, educational level, ownership, duality).

Empirical research based on principal-agent conflicts has revealed that corporate governance plays an important role in governing financial reporting practices in developed markets. The emerging markets, however, are characterized by principal-principal conflict. The institutional specificities of emerging markets are significantly different from those in developed markets, and thus, their corporate governance mechanisms and financial reporting practices are also different. This study aimed at critically reviewing 50 most relevant studies focusing on emerging markets to study the role of corporate governance in governing financial reporting practices. The articles were analyzed based on the proxies for measuring financial reporting and corporate governance, sample, methodology, and major findings. The review revealed that earnings quality is the most widely used proxy of financial reporting and majority of the articles examined two or more corporate governance mechanisms together. The synthesis of the findings revealed that different corporate governance mechanisms impact earnings quality and disclosure quality differently. (c) 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Earnings management behavior is the use of accounting procedures, through accounting policies, to intentionally purposeful control in the provision of information to users. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between ownership structure factors and earnings management behavior of 30 Vietnamese commercial banks. The paper uses the ordinary least square method to examine this relationship and employs time series data of 15 years from 2005 to 2019. The study also uses agency theory an asymmetric information theory. The authors examined six independent variables related to the ownership structure and these variables are typical of Vietnamese commercial banks. The results of the study show that the foreign ownership ratio is an opposite effect, while the ownership concentration variable has a positive effect on earnings management behavior of Vietnamese commercial banks. Based on that, the article proposes a number of policy suggestions for the State bank of Vietnam and Board of directors of commercial banks as well as investors to identify and to limit the earnings management behaviors of Vietnamese commercial banks. This contributes to ensuring information transparency as well as improving the quality of accounting information of Vietnamese commercial banks in the coming years. (c) Copyright: The Author(s).

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates the impact of women directors on financial outcomes--return and risk of Indian companies. It applies fixed and random effects Tobit regressions to examine the effect of female directors on financial outcomes (returns and risk) of the firm, controlling promoters' shareholding, leverage, firm growth and age, board size and board meetings. The study does not find any support to agency and resource dependence theories because the proportion of women directors in most Indian boards is too small to make much impact. However, it has a moderating influence to reduce variations in accounting profits and stock returns. The investors reward also meeting the regulatory quota of woman member on the boards by higher market returns indicating a signalling effect. The study adds an understanding of quota induced women directors' influence on the firm's financial outcomes. However, the regulators should be cautious in mandating induction of women members on the boards as they might be inexperienced or lack the needed grounding to effectively influence board processes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance and earnings opacity in China. Design/methodology/approach: Two corporate governance mechanisms form the basis of the analysis: 1) the board of directors and 2) the external audit function. OLS regression analysis is employed on a large sample from 2000 to 2014 with 20,235 firm-year observations. Findings: Corporate governance is found to be associated with reduced levels of earnings opacity for Chinese listed companies. Furthermore, the association between corporate governance and reduced levels of earnings opacity strengthened after the implementation of various key reforms. Practical implications: Chinese regulators are advised to proceed with caution as not all Western approaches to corporate governance are transferrable to the Chinese setting. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by analyzing broad latent constructs of corporate governance in addition to individual observable dimensions in order to reveal that various key reforms have been successful in strengthening the link between governance and reporting quality for Chinese listed companies.

This study examines the influence of minority shareholders on the transfer of corporate governance practices into companies in other countries where they invest. By analysing UK firms that acquired a minority ownership in foreign firms between 1993 and 2014, we find evidence of better corporate governance in the board structure of target foreign firms following UK firms taking a minority shareholding, the extent and nature of the changes varying depending on the quality of investor protection in the country the foreign target firm is located. Our findings contribute to the on-going debates on the spillover effect of better corporate governance practices via cross-border mergers and acquisitions as well as relationship between internal (board of directors) and external (country's quality of investor protection) corporate governance mechanisms.

The agency problem gives an incentive to present corporate governance codes that help reduce the conflict of interest between company owners and managers. This study used corporate governance indicators to assess the relationship between CG and earnings management. Managers use earnings management to overstate or understate the figures to serve their own interests. Data were collected for the 33 sampled companies in this study from the annual reports of the listed companies at the Palestine stock exchange. The modified cross-sectional Jones model was used to define the value of earnings management. The independent variables (CG indicators) were board independence, board size, ownership concentration, CEO duality, and audit quality. In addition, to control variables to account for differences in size and performance of the firm, these variables are company size, return on asset and leverage. By using the regression model, a significant correlation between EM and size for the year 2015 and between EM and ownership concentration, size and return on assets for the year 2016 were found. The overall regression result showed that the model fits with the variable used. The R-squared (coefficient of determination) values showed that approximately 65% and 73% of the variability of earnings management was accounted for by the variables in the model.

This paper argues that hybridization is a process that has been going on for decades in Japan and has contributed to improvement of Japanese corporate governance, and that the regulations regarding the board of directors are a good example of this hybridization process. The paper outlines the main changes within Japanese corporate governance system and identifies their determinants. Three main waves of hybridization of Japanese regulations and corporate governance are identified, along with three functioning structures of Japanese boards, and their strong and weak points. The company with statutory auditors (with Kansayaku Board), the company with Three Committees-nomination, audit, and remuneration-and the company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee are presented as evidence of this hybridization process. The paper addresses the research question: why has hybridization rather than convergence resulted in an improvement of Japanese corporate governance? The method of critical analysis is applied to academic literature sources, legal acts, and corporate governance regulations. The article contributes to a reduction in the research gap in Polish academic literature in the field of Japanese corporate governance, especially with respect to Japanese boards.

We investigate whether corporate board members with media expertise influence firms' media coverage and media slant. We find that firms with a media professional on the board of directors receive more media coverage, and articles written about them include fewer negative words compared with articles on control firms. These findings highlight the importance of the composition of the board of directors as a determinant of information disclosure mechanism. (c) 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.

We utilize a sample of spinoff firms that need to form a new board of directors, to shed light on the chief executive officer (CEO) influence hypothesis. We find spinoff boards with a CEO who was the parent firm CEO to be similarly structured to the boards of industry and size-matched peers, whereas spinoff boards with nonparent CEOs are structured for greater monitoring. Consistent with our board structure results, the CEO compensation and replacement decisions of parent CEO spinoff boards are more lenient toward spinoff CEOs, whereas those of nonparent CEO spinoff boards are more consistent with protecting shareholder benefits.

Introduction: Shareholder activism comprises a range of activities by public companies' shareholders who desire some change in the corporation and intervene in the management's decisions. The goals of activists are various. They may seek to change the company's strategy, financial structure, management, or board in general. More specifically they may seek to change the capital allocation strategy (stock buybacks, dividends, or company's acquisitions policies), the board composition, the company's executive compensation plans, or the company's certain functions (risk management, audit). Purpose: The purpose of this literature review research study is to explore the concept of shareholder activism. According to a point of view, these activist actions stimulate better corporate governance practice in the companies and ultimately lead to an increase in the company's stock price in the short term. The others claim that activism increases the company's share price volatility in the long term. In the near future, the impact of shareholder activism will continue to rise and the ways how the companies respond to it is gaining importance. This study sheds light on the types of shareholder activism, when they are likely to approach a company and which tactics they most likely use. Methodology: Considering the rapid expansion of shareholder activism concept in the world the author makes a review of literature on shareholder activism. The structure of this chapter is as follows. First, the characteristics of shareholder activism are introduced. Second, the theoretical background of this concept is given in detail. Third, the types of shareholder activism are discussed. Finally, the conclusion comprises a summary of shareholder activism. Findings:The study finds out that shareholder activism has started to have a significant influence on corporate governance policy that a firm adopts in recent years. Shareholder activism increases levels of shareholder engagement in firm decisions and fosters a long-term corporate governance culture. As institutional investors get a higher portion from global equity investments, their role in shareholder activism will increase. There are opinions suggesting that investor activism will lead to better corporate governance practices in firms, leading to an increase in firm share prices in the short term. The shareholder activism phenomenon seems to be on the agenda of all companies in the near future. (c) 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.

The present study was designed to determine the relationship between corporate governance and tax avoidance in an international setting. Financial and governance data sourced from the Datastream database for a sample of Japanese and UK firms between 2012 and 2017 are used. First, we examine the direct effect of several corporate governance mechanisms on tax avoidance. Second, we divide the full sample into two groups (common law and code law legal system) to explore the relationship between law, corporate governance, and tax avoidance. We use both univariate and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression methods to examine our hypotheses. This study finds that the board size, independent directors, and the presence of women on boards of directors reduce the likelihood of tax avoidance. However, we find an insignificant association between ownership concentration and tax avoidance. Second, it also finds that firms in countries with higher country-level governance engage in less tax avoidance. The results also suggest that the role of corporate governance is more pronounced for firms operating in common law countries than those in code law countries. This manuscript is one of the few studies that examine the relationship between corporate governance and tax avoidance in an international setting with different legal and institutional environment. This relationship differs across the two countries. This paper clearly identifies implications for research, practice, and society. It documents that when a country implements a good system of governance, which targets improving transparency and accountability, it will lead to less corporate tax avoidance. (c) 2020 Sciendo.

Purpose: This study aims to answer two unique related questions on the overarching relationship between a CEO's personal religious affiliation, the firm's advertising spending decision and its shareholder value. First, does the CEO's religious affiliation, a proxy for risk taking, influence the firm's advertising spending decision? Second, does the advertising spending decision mediate the relationship between the CEO's religious affiliation and the firm's shareholder value? Design/methodology/approach: This study uses data on the religious affiliations of CEOs of publicly listed US firms, 1992-2014, from Marquis Who's Who; advertising spending and shareholder value from Compustat, and panel data-based regression models including CEO characteristics from ExecuComp, and firm-, industry- and time-based controls. Findings: We find higher advertising spending levels for Protestant over Catholic-led firms, and advertising spending mediates the relationship between a CEO's religious affiliation and the firm's shareholder value. Research limitations/implications: Marketing theory needs to incorporate the missing but fundamental effect of the CEO's religious affiliation-based values on decisions and outcomes. Practical implications: Boards of Directors may need to align the CEO's and their firm's spending goals. Originality/value: While previous studies focused on the influence of religious affiliation on consumers' attitudes and behavior, and executives' financial and R&D spending decisions, this study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to investigate the effect of a CEO's religious affiliation on the firm's advertising spending decision and its shareholder value.

In the contemporary business world, the diversity of boards in terms of gender has been examined by many researchers and those responsible for public policy. Although many studies have assessed the correlation between how a company performs financially and the gender diversity of its board, this research has tended to focus on larger companies and the results have been inconclusive. This paper will re-examine key elements of the existing discourse by focusing on a selection of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in France between 2009 and 2014. Panel data and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) methodology was employed to assert empirical control over both the significance and direction of the correlation between the financial performance of an organisation and the diversity of its board. Unlike the literature, in our study of French SMEs, we found no notable correlation between how a company performs financially and how diverse its board is in terms of gender. This paper will examine the benefits firms can access by ensuring the gender diversity of their respective boards. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

From a corporate governance point of view, this paper addresses the question of how corporate ownership and board characteristics influence firm value for a sample of Ibero-American companies. Specifically, we analyse indexed non-financial companies from Chile and Spain for the period 2007-2016, using the GMM panel data technique. Our research is novel in considering a two-country approach, with one emerging and one developed country, and in analysing how corporate ownership and board characteristics, in addition to contextual variables, determine firm value. Our results assess the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms. Although findings are intriguing regarding ownership concentration, they confirm the benefits of a good board of directors. This type of board is characterised by a large size, sufficiently independent directors, and a balance in terms of gender diversity. We provide several policy recommendations from our main findings.

This study examines whether market participants react to the announcements of corporate governance ranking exercises. As a regulatory innovation, the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan initiated and administered two ranking exercises, one in 2015 and the other in 2016, on all publicly listed companies. Adopting anchoring-and-adjustment theory, the study predicts that market participants will react strongly to the second announcement if the ranking obtained in the second exercise turns out to be better than the ranking in the first round. Employing an event study methodology, the study shows that market participants react positively and significantly to firms ranked in the top 50% in the second corporate governance exercise. Their reactions to the announcement are even stronger among those that did not list in the top 20% in the first exercise, but made it into the top 50% in the second one. Overall, our analyses support that anchoring-and-adjustment theory effectively explains market participants' behaviour. Since the monitoring of the board of directors and investors may not effectively mitigate the potential moral hazard committed by family owners/executives, our empirical evidence demonstrates that a ranking exercise probably can be employed to supplement routine corporate governance disclosures made in annual reports, in order to strengthen the check-and-balance mechanism and reduce the risk of principal-principal conflicts. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of the research findings and propose directions for future studies. (c) 2020 Accounting Foundation, The University of Sydney

This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms on the dividend payout policies of Bahraini listed companies. By using multivariate regression model, the results of this study show a significant relationship between the firms' dividend payout ratio and five CG mechanisms (i e. board of directors' meetings, the board of directors' size, number of board of directors' committees, audit committee's meetings and number of independent audit committee members). On the other hand, the relationship between the firm's dividend payout ratio and the remaining two CG mechanisms (i e. audit committee size and independent audit committee chairmen) have been found to be insignificant. The findings of the study will help the shareholders, lenders, and policymakers in Bahrain to develop sound dividend payout policies that will contribute to the increase of the investors' returns, protect the lenders' interest and reduce the agency cost. Also, the study will contribute to the ongoing debate on the impact of CG mechanisms on the firm's dividend payout policies in Bahrain by analyzing the data from the country's stock market.

In the backdrop of the convergence-divergence debate, the goal of this article is to examine the proliferation of corporate governance codes in the light of a single factor, namely varying corporate ownership structures across countries. While such codes emanated and became popular in the United Kingdom where companies largely display dispersed shareholding, the concept has been disseminated to countries that carry considerably different ownership structures, i.e. mainly concentrated shareholding. This is bound to give rise to incongruities in the implementation of these codes. In order to enunciate the claim made above, the article will consider two aspects that convergence advocates have focused on, namely (i) shareholder empowerment and (ii) self-regulation. For example, corporate governance codes place considerable emphasis on the structure and independence of the boards of directors of companies as a means to ensure shareholder protection. While this approach is meant to produce results in companies with dispersed shareholding, the same cannot be said of companies with concentrated shareholding where the empowerment of shareholders through director independence or other means would only embolden the already dominant controlling shareholders. Moving to self-regulation, a voluntary code operating on a 'comply-or-explain' basis can ensure sufficient adherence only if certain factors are present in the jurisdiction where it is applied. Relying upon available empirical evidence, this article finds that use of self-regulation in voluntary codes of corporate governance may generate different results depending upon the ownership structures of companies, thereby exhibiting signs of divergence on this count.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and GRI reporting. More specifically, the study seeks to analyse board independence, board size and ownership concentration and their relationships with GRI reporting. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses of the study were tested in a sample of 287 Brazilian companies listed on the B3, the Brazilian stock exchange, using logistic regression models. Data from 2013 were collected from the Econoinfo and GRI databases. Findings -The findings show that there is a positive relationship between both board independence and GRI reporting and board size and GRI reporting, and a neutral relationship between ownership concentration and GRI reporting. These results indicate that the corporate governance structure influences a company's decision to engage in social issue and stakeholders' relationship activities. Originality/value - The contribution of this study is it presents theoretical arguments and empirical evidence regarding the influence of corporate governance structure on CSD beyond the Anglo-Saxon context. The results show that good corporate governance practices cannot be generalized to different contexts. (c) FECAP.

The governance literature finds that independent directors from lending banks (commercial bank directors or CBDs) bring both financial expertise and conflict of interest between shareholders and debt holders. We examine how the presence of CBDs affects the implicit incentive of CEO turnover. Using BoardEx and DealScan data, we hypothesize and find that CBDs make the CEO turnover more sensitive to both performance and risk. Post-CEO turnover analysis reveals that firm performance improves and risk decreases in the presence of CBDs. (c) 2020 Korean Securities Association

Corporate governance is not a new topic but has become more relevant in the last years due to the financial crisis of 2008, when diverse companies went to bankruptcy, and investor's protection was weakened. Thus, diverse countries have revised corporate governance mechanisms and recommendations to restore the confidence of investors and the transparency of companies' financial reports. This work aims to explain the evolution of corporate governance practices in Portugal. We provide information on corporate governance' legal framework. Then we explain ownership structures and board of directors' and directors' remuneration practices. Shareholders' rights and activism are also explained. Finally, we linked the topic of corporate governance and companies' performance and social responsibility. This work contributes to increasing literature review on corporate governance practices, by presenting the evolution of corporate governance practices in a specific country, Portugal.

An established succession planning program for the identification and grooming of its next leader helps maintain the continuity of firm strategy and leadership style, which influences long-term firm performance and viability. Disclosure of succession planning information may alleviate investors' doubts about whether the firm has a succession planning plan, while it may increase competition for CEO candidates, leading to increases in the cost of securing qualified candidates. This study explores what determines firms' decisions to provide this disclosure using firms that initiate CEO succession planning disclosure in a given year and their control firms. We find that firms are more likely to initiate the disclosure of CEO succession planning when 1) segment concentration (negatively related to organizational complexity) becomes lower, 2) the board of directors becomes more independent, 3) the CEO has reached the retirement age of 64, 4) the CEO becomes more important relative to other executive officers in the industry labor market, 5) the number of analysts following (reflecting external monitoring) increases, and 6) CEO tenure (reflecting CEO entrenchment) declines. Overall, our findings suggest that the disclosure of CEO succession planning is motivated by investor demand for a smooth transition among top management and enhanced transparency in CEO succession planning.

The purpose of this comparative case study is to understand codetermination in two family firms. Thereby, this study aims at exploring the role of employee-representatives in two non-listed family businesses. Empirically, this study draws on an interpretive case study of two family businesses. Its findings extend earlier research, by exploring and introducing the phenomenon of codetermination in the family business literature. Codetermination is explored with the perspective of paternalism as analytical lens. Theoretically, the study draws on the control-collaboration paradox which helps understanding the phenomenon of codetermination. The study reveals different types of codetermination, i.e., the works council and the board of directors. The implications of these types are highlighted and discussed. Findings highlight the need for professional governance structures in order to facilitate cooperation between family owners, the management, and employee representatives. Professional governance allows handling the paternalistic ideological underpinnings which can otherwise prevent continued firm success, leading to unsolved conflicts. (c) 2020, Management Revue.

This research aims to analyse the connection between political connection of the board of directors and board of commissioners and bank performance in Indonesia from 2007 to 2017. We use the data from all banks with several dependent variables return on asset and Z-score to measuring the banking performance and various independent variables, such as, board of directors and commissioners' political connection, board characteristics and bank specifics. The results showed that political connection of the board of directors and commissioners leads to a good performance in each bank. This is because political parties and other government agencies would want to show good reputation by giving good talents and insights in banks to increase their performance and the nation's economic condition. Banks with political connection would also get several advantages, such as, less risky loans given to firms with the same political connection. (c) 2020 Universita Putra Malaysia.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

Purpose - The governance of firms as assured by the board through good decisions about capital structure is max-imum profit with an aim to enhance the wealth of shareowners. We focus on the corporate governance relationship with the financial performance of firms and check whether this relationship is meditated by the capital structure of the company. Design/Methodology/Approach - The study estimates said objectives using Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and a test for mediation analysis for total of 205 observations of 41 firms listed on the KSE-100 index of the Pakistan stock exchange for a period from 2013 to 2017. Findings - The results show that there is a strong positive relationship between corporate governance, financial leverage, and firm performance. Non-executive directors and female directorship negatively related to the firm performance and financial leverage of financial firms of Pakistan. The study contributed to existing literature with financial leverage positively and significantly mediating the relationship between firm performance and non-exec-utive directors, audit committees, and ownership concentration in developing nations. Research Implications - The board of directors always consider the capital mix while making decisions as it helps to improve financial performance via good governance. Thus, this research has provided the best picture for firm policy makers, in particular, to help decide which components of corporate governance as mediated by capital structure are necessary for a firm's financial well-being.

This paper examines the influence of corporate governance on the market capitalisation of Indian companies listed under BSE. The study concludes that there exists a positively significant relationship between board diversity attributes and market capitalisation of the firms. The results show a positive impact on the female board of director(s), firm age, and firm size. There is a positive relationship between the market value of the firm and the presence of women board of directors which explains the breach of the glassceiling effect for the Indian economy. The female board of directors is more hardworking and ready to accept major changes to improve the firm's efficiency and adds value to it indicating that women must have a place in the top management of companies. Further, the older firm has a good market reputation and firm size is also improved positively with market value. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved.

We examine the effect of book-tax differences on CEO compensation. We posit that CEOs can opportunistically exercise the discretion in GAAP to increase accounting income without affecting taxable income and in so doing increase their compensation. We test the data to determine which competing hypothesis dominates - efficiency or rent-seeking. Under the efficiency hypothesis, the board of directors uses the information in book-tax differences to undo CEOs' attempts to artificially inflate accounting income and hence CEO compensation is negatively associated with book-tax differences. Under the rent-seeking hypothesis, CEOs gain effective control of the pay-setting process so that they set their own pay with little oversight from shareholders and directors. Directors do not use the information in book-tax differences to undo CEOs' attempted earnings manipulation and this gives rise to a positive association between CEO compensation and book-tax differences. Consistent with the efficiency hypothesis, we find that CEO compensation is negatively associated with book-tax differences suggesting that directors use the information in booktax differences to reduce excessive CEO compensation. We also find that strong corporate governance structure strengthens the negative association between CEO compensation and book-tax differences. Specifically, firms with high insider equity ownership and high proportion of independent directors on the board have lower CEO compensation when book-tax differences are large.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance. Findings would assist the committee of MCCG2012 and other authorities to reinforce on the corporate governance compliance and good practice. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The research tried to assess the impact of board characteristics on Tunisian bank's performance. The empirical study is based on a sample of 10 commercial banks during the period 2008-2017. Firstly, we proceed to estimate the impact of board characteristics on bank performance measured by Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equities (ROE) ratios. The estimation results achieved have positive and negative effects on the economic and financial bank's profitability. Hence, on the one hand, the estimate test gives a positive impact of ratio Market to book and the ratio Interest / Commissions in case of economic performance (VIC). On the other hand, these two ratios have a negative impact on performance measured by the ROE and ROA. Regarding the board and bank size, the estimate test gives a negative impact on economic profitability and a positive impact on financial profitability. (c) 2020 Sciedu Press.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance. In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors' prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Management published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Academy of Management

In this paper, we show how corporate governance reforms and research have been mutually reinforcing in emerging markets and propose a research agenda going forward. Acknowledging the by now broad recognition of corporate governance as a key development driver, we show how work on corporate governance in emerging markets has led research globally by focusing on the deep issues of ownership structures, property rights and organisational forms. Using the papers presented at the latest international conference of the Emerging Markets Corporate Governance Research Network, we illustrate how analyses of board structures, specifically gender diversity, has contributed to understanding of board dynamics and informed corporate governance reforms. Considering ongoing economic and socio-political trends, we conclude with a general research agenda for corporate governance in emerging markets. (c) 2020

This article makes progress in understanding how the heterogeneity of governance factors, and changes in the political/economic landscape influence family firms' risk taking. Using a sample of 133 Chilean listed firms, this article studies the risk taking behavior of family firms from 2009 to 2016. Using several informational sources, an unbalanced panel data set is built to make estimations employing the two-way fixed effects OLS data panel regressions. GMM is also employed for robustness. Chilean family firms' risk-taking, measured through z-score and ROA volatility, is higher than in non-family firms. This would be a response to take advantage of business opportunities that enhance their long-term position in financial and socioemotional wealth. Results also indicate that founders' leadership (on the board of directors) aligns with higher levels of corporate risk, while the influence of founders' descendants within the board is in the opposite direction. Finally, political uncertainty has a negative and statistically significant influence on Chilean family firms' risk taking. Context (defined as point of reference) is a critical factor in explaining family firms' strategic behavior through socioemotional wealth. Performance above/below expectation, the danger of bankruptcy and the global financial crises have been used as points of reference (context) to explain family firms' risk taking, but political and economic landscapes have not been included before as explanatory variables.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between selected board characteristics and ownership elements and the performance of firms listed in the Muscat Securities Market (MSM30). The examination focused on how the firm financial performance was affected by the board size, the number of board meetings and the ratio of the independent board of directors along to the ownership concentration types (i.e. institutional, state and concentrated individual ownership). Design/methodology/approach: Data were extracted from the annual reports available online on the MSM30 website over a period of seven years (2009-2015). The sample consisted of 14 firms belonging to the non-financial sector. The data were of a balanced type and there were 98 observations. The analysis was conducted using the ordinary least square in STATA with the use of the robustness technique of standard error. Findings: The findings of this study provide evidence that the selected elements for board characteristics and ownership influence firm performance. Nevertheless, such influence has its interpretation that differs to some extent from other securities markets in the developing countries. For instance, the ratio of the independent board of directors, the number of board director's meetings, state ownership and concentrated individual ownership were inversely affecting the firm performance. However, institutional ownership and board size were found to have a positive effect on firm performance. Originality/value: Studies on the influence of corporate governance and ownership structures in the context of Oman are still scarce. MSM30 received little attention, even though such an index encompasses the most liquid and the most profitable firms. MSM30 is an important index for investors in Oman looking for capital gains. Accordingly, this present study contributes to the knowledge body by providing new findings related to Oman and compares it with the other markets within Gulf Council Countries (GCC) and around the world. This will provide more understanding of the Omani context. Moreover, the authors anticipate that the outcomes of this research, which so far is the most comprehensive study in the Omani context in terms of the impact of corporate governance and ownership structure on firm financial performance can significantly shape corporate governance discourse, practices and policies in Oman, in particular, and in other GCC countries in general, to improve financial performance and corporate sustainability.

Prior research documents that information transmitted via director networks affects firms' policies and real economic activities. Given a manager's potential monopoly over firm information, it is important to analyze whether information transmission through director social networks undermines the manager's control. Specifically, we explore whether information flow through director networks influences managers' ability to hoard bad news. We predict and find that the extent of external connections of the board of directors is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Additional analysis implies that this evidence is driven by firms with more powerful executives, with weaker auditor monitoring, or subject to strong investor protection, and by directors with greater monitoring incentives or responsibilities and directors with less firm-specific knowledge. Collectively, our research lends empirical support for the monitoring view under which better-informed directors narrow the scope for bad news hoarding evident in stock price crash risk. In another series of tests, we fail to find evidence consistent with the information leakage view under which directors pass sensitive firm-specific information to connections that trade on the information before its public release. Other analysis helps dispel the concern that the endogenous match between directors and companies is spuriously responsible for our core results. Our empirical findings have important implications on how social networks affect the proper functioning of capital markets. (c) CAAA

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand the circumstances under which board behavior is affected by gender diversity. The "reasoned action approach" is used as a lens through which to assess the extent that the behavior of the board varies with its gender diversity. Research Findings/Insights: The study uses archival data from a panel sample of 80,395 directorships observed between 1998 and 2012. Boardroom gender diversity is significantly related to director personal responsibility (board attendance), CEO accountability, and risk taking. Our findings highlight the key importance of the exposure of male directors to women directors on boards beyond the focal board. This suggests a positive externality or a spillover effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The empirical findings of this study highlight the importance of allowing for the operation of social norms when studying boardroom decision making. Experience gained by male directors of working with women directors on other boards, beyond the focal board, is shown to enable women directors to contribute more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers encouragement to policy makers' intent on increasing the presence of women on corporate boards. These results point to a spillover effect: there is an observed impact of women on boards that acts not only directly on the board on which they sit but also through the network of boards on which their male counterparts sit.

The present work aimed to empirically examine the association between corporate governance mechanisms and the extent of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in European financial institutions. The corporate governance variables, particularly board size, board independence, the proportion of female directors, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, ownership concentration and CEO ownership, were used. The sample of this empirical research consisted of 115 financial institutions belonging to 12 European countries from 2007 to 2017, and panel data regression was used for analysis. The results indicate that board size, board independence, the proportion of female directors and the CEO ownership have positive associations with the extent of CSR disclosure, while CEO duality and ownership concentration have no significant associations with the extent of CSR disclosure. This study is important due to following reasons: First, it focused on the financial sector which is often excluded from CSR studies due to its specific legal regulations and its little environmental impact. Second, this study provides empirical evidence that some governance mechanisms are important determinants of CSR disclosure in the financial sector. Third, it uses the environmental, social and governance score, which has not been widely used in CSR studies, especially in financial institutions. Finally, the research states the crucial implications for the financial sector and regulatory bodies.

The article examines whether different corporate governance practices and ownership patterns influence firm performance and value creation in an emerging market context. The study establishes that the governance-performance relation depends highly on the estimation tools applied. While the pooled regression or fixed effects panel model may provide spurious and biased relations, the system generalized method of moments (GMM) model provides superior and valid results by addressing all types of endogeneity problems. The results show that firms with a separate CEO and chairperson outperform firms with CEO duality. Also, higher executive salary leads to improved firm performance. Moreover, higher promoter shareholding leads to greater value creation and improved firm performance, and domestic institutional investors (DII) have a significant impact on firm performance.

This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between a diverse set of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms and corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) in Southeast Asian countries under national stakeholder reform. Design/methodology/approach: Data analysis is based on 171 of the largest companies across six Southeast Asian countries using a 30-item CSD measure. Findings: The authors find that there are wide variations in the levels of CSD across the countries. The findings indicate that board size, board gender diversity, block ownership and the presence of a sustainability committee are significant determinants of CSD. Additionally, whilst more stringent stakeholder governance reform motivates firms to publish more sustainability information, it fails to influence the effectiveness of the board of directors in promoting CSD. Practical implications: Findings of this study highlight the essential role internal governance structure plays in monitoring corporate actions and enabling corporations to reduce their legitimacy gap. The findings further encourage regulators and policymakers to question, with utmost importance, the effectiveness of stakeholder reform in making significant organisational changes. Originality/value: There is a dearth of studies that examine the CG-CSD nexus in relation to specific institutional characteristics. Existing studies mainly focus on a single country with similar institutional environments and thus limiting the ability to understand the "context specificity" of sustainability content development. This paper provides an overview of stakeholder reform in Southeast Asian countries and empirically substantiates the relationship between CG and CSD across six countries undergoing such reforms in the region.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the relationship between audit partner and firm industry specialization and board of director independence on the decision by Taiwanese firms to use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) flexibility concerning reporting interest income and expense and dividends received in different sections of the statement of cash flows. This flexibility existed in Taiwan for the first time in 2013, the year that Taiwan switched from its own generally accepted accounting principle to IFRS. Design/methodology/approach: Using 2013 data for a sample of 1,227 firms, 354 of whom changed their reporting classification, this study examined the interaction effect of board independence and partner-level and firm-level auditor industry specialization on the cash flow reporting decision using logistic regression. Findings: The results show there is a substitute relationship between board independence and partner-level industry specialization on the change in cash flow reporting classification, but a complementary relationship between board independence and firm-level auditor specialization. Further, both partner-level and firm-level auditor industry specializations have a complementary (but negative) relationship with board independence as to whether the firm is likely to report interest expense paid in the operating or financing activities sections. Practical implications: An important implication is that knowing the levels of audit firm and partner specialization and how independent the board is, is useful for researchers and regulators in investigating auditor-client relationships and understanding the influences of variables investigated here on the outcome(s) of accounting policy and regulatory changes. Originality/value: This study improved the field's understanding of the impacts of audit partner and firm specialization, board independence and relevant interactions on cash flow reporting choices.

The literature investigating corporate governance (CG) disclosure has predominantly stressed the monitoring role of the board of directors, analysing the association between information about the board's independence and firm market performance. Drawing from managerial studies, the governance literature has recently recognized corporate performance is affected by a wider set of directors' personal traits. However, CG reporting does not currently require disclosure of most of these characteristics. We believe knowledge of directors' personal traits is valuable for investors if these characteristics are indicators of company performance. Drawing on a sample of listed Italian family firms, we embrace a wide set of hand-collected information that captures directors' profiles to verify their association with Tobin's Q. Even if such associations are casual, we infer that information about board members' profiles beyond CG report disclosures is useful for market participants. The results from the regression analyses show that information about directors' personal details, educational backgrounds, and work experience in specific professional areas is predictive of market performance, and that the market evaluates board members' personal information that is currently ignored in CG reports. The study offers practical contributions to standard setters, highlighting the need to extend CG reporting requirements for directors' personal profiles. Further, the evidence contributes to drawing the attention of preparers and users to board of directors' profile information that is currently not disclosed in CG reporting.

This study aims to assess the impact of IT governance on banks' financial performance in the context of Palestine while controlling for bank-specific and governance variables. The sample consists of six local banks listed on the Palestine Exchange over the period 2008-2019. While IT governance is proxied by the presence of IT experience within board of directors and within executive management, performance is provided by two accounting measures, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Using a path analysis and a General Linear Model (GLM), results show that there is a positive impact of IT governance on both performance measures, only when measured by IT executives. Our results highlight the importance of IT governance and confirm the need to develop and improve the corporate governance codes in Palestine to strengthen IT governance.

Research Question/Issue: Despite the importance of political ties to firm strategy and performance, little is known about why and how firms form political ties. This study examines how firm-specific governance structures function as important determinants of the formation of political ties and how the impact of governance structures evolves during institutional transition of emerging economies. Research Findings/Insights: Our empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal data set involving manually coded political ties of listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. We find that business group affiliation and family ownership facilitate the formation of political ties but that such effects diminish as market infrastructures and regulatory institutions develop. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study systematically examines how corporate governance structures affect the formation of political ties. It identifies an overlooked explanation for the dynamics of political ties that resides in the internal governance structures of firms. It contributes to the corporate governance research by demonstrating how governance structures other than the board of directors can provide resources to facilitate strategic actions such as political tie establishment. It also enriches research on corporate governance bundles by showing the interdependence among multilevel governance mechanisms in the context of political tie formation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for business executives interested in managing interdependence with government. While business group affiliates and family firms are better able to link to politicians, such advantages diminish during institutional transition. Hence, group leaders and family owners should consider other political activities to effectively manage political risks as institutions develop. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This paper empirically examines the linkage between ownership pattern, board composition and earnings management of Indian firms using the system Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) by considering panel data 364 non-financial firms from 2017 to 2019, comprising of 1092 firm-year observations. The study also uses Pooled OLS and Fixed Effects model to compare the results with the system GMM in examining board composition-earnings management relation. The study reveals that board independence and diligence of independent directors do not play any role in curbing earnings management. Also, busy independent directors and persons with multiple directorships are not necessarily useful in arresting earnings management. However, earnings management practice is more prevalent in firms where the same person enjoys the power of a CEO as well as chairman. An increase in promoters' shareholding also leads to an increase in earnings management. While earnings management is not influenced by FII shareholding, it increases with the increase in DII shareholding. This study is important for several reasons. First, since this study considers the period after the implementation of a new financial reporting system in India (popularly known as IND-AS), the findings of this study reflect the earnings management behavior of Indian firms in light of new financial reporting practices. Second, the study considers the period when significant governance initiatives are taken after the implementation of the New Companies Act, 2013. This study contributes to the literature by addressing the recent governance norms and aligning the relevant policy implications accordingly. The findings of this study reveal a clear understanding as to which board level and governance parameters are useful in constraining earnings management and disclosing quality earnings by companies in an emerging market context. The outcomes are also explained further for relevant policy implications. Board of directors, managers, investors, regulators, and policymakers can find these outcomes useful for making critical governance-related decisions. Finally, the study contributes to the existing literature by providing evidence on what board level and governance parameters are useful in constraining firms' earnings management in an emerging economy under the regime of new financial reporting practices.

This study investigates the relationship between Muslim CEOs and bank risk-taking based on Indonesian banks from 2010 to 2017. We find that there is no significant difference in risk-taking among Indonesian banks based on whether the banks have Muslim CEOs or not. However, we find that only state-owned banks with Muslim CEOs display significantly low risk-taking. We further find that foreign-owned banks with Muslim CEOs display a significant low risk-taking only in the presence of Muslim-dominated boards. We show that Muslims must be in the majority on 2-tier boards (board of directors and board of commissioners) to significantly influence Muslim CEOs' risk-taking. In addition, we find no related evidence from family-owned firms. Further analysis reveals that banks with a low concentration of ultimate ownership indicate Muslim CEOs' low risk-taking behaviour, and vice versa. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This research investigates the relationship between fat cat firms and crash risk. Our empirical results find that under industry fixed effects, fat cat firms are positively associated with stock price crash, demonstrating that a self-interested board of directors leads to a serious agency problem. We find consistent results after we control for other types of fat cat firms, sample selection bias, endogeneity problem and use different measurements of crash risk. Finally, we also report that under the within-firm scenario, the more frequently firms are listed as fat-cat firm announcements, the worse agency problem it encountered, which causes fat cat firms to have higher crash risk.

We identify a sample of firms with directors employed by institutional investors and examine the effect of a direct channel of institutional monitoring. Using difference-in-differences tests, we find weak evidence that institutional directors have a positive effect on informational efficiency. More importantly, institutional directors have a significantly positive impact on stock returns over the long run. Further analysis shows that the presence of institutional directors leads to a slight increase of managerial entrenchment. Consistent with the notion that entrenched managers reduce risk-taking, we also find significant decreases in R&D investments and financial leverage, and significant increases in payouts for firms with institutional directors. The findings suggest that aligning with the interest of long-term investors, institutional directors deter firms from pursuing potentially value-decreasing investment projects and influence firms to return value to investors through lower debts and higher payouts, mainly share repurchases.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the individual and combined effect of managerial ownership and external audit quality, as two control mechanisms, on earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies ordinary least squares estimates on fixed-time effects panel regression model to test the impact of the investigated variables on earnings management for the whole population of banks and insurance companies listed at Damascus Securities Exchange (DSE) during the period from 2011 to 2018. Findings: The empirical evidence suggests a negative non-linear relationship between managerial ownership (as proxied by board of directors' ownership) on earnings management. However, neither audit quality nor the simultaneous effect of the managerial ownership and audit quality (Big 4) affects earnings management. Research limitations/implications: DSE is dominated by the financial sector and the number of observations is constrained by the recent establishment of DSE and the small number of firms listed at DSE. In addition, the non-availability of data on executive directors' and foreign ownerships restrict our ability to uncover the impact of different dimensions of ownership structure on earnings management. Practical implications: First, it stimulates investors to purchase stocks in financial firms that enjoy both high managerial ownership, as they seem enjoying higher earnings quality. Second, the findings encourage external auditors to consider the ownership structure when choosing their clients as the financial statements' quality is affected by this structure. Third, researchers may need to consider the role of managerial ownership when analyzing the determinants of earnings management. Originality/value: It fills the gap in the literature, as it investigates the impact of both managerial ownership and audit quality on earnings management in a special conflict context and in an unexplored emerging market of DSE. It suggests that managerial ownership exerts a significant role in controlling earnings management practices when loose regulatory environment combines conflict conditions. However, external audit quality fails to counter earnings management practices when conditions are fierce. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance (CG) is a fundamental criteria for enhancing investors' and stake-holders' trust, relatively recently recognized in emerging markets. This study investigates the effects of CG practices on the firm-level financial performance of Borsa Istanbul XKURY-indexed companies during 2007-2019. Four specific aspects of CG are analysed: shareholders' rights, public disclosure and transparency, stakeholders' rights, and board of directors functioning, as defined by the Turkish Code of Corporate Governance, in line with international principles of CG issued by OECD. Alternative estimations of panel regression analysis indicate a positive association between stakeholder-oriented governance practices and firm-level financial performance expressed by accounting measures for both financial and non-financial companies. Shareholder protection policies have a negative influence on accounting-based performance, especially for non-financial industries, whereas the corporate practices related to board of directors and public disclosure vary between financial and non-financial entities. These findings contribute to international research on CG implications for emerging markets, providing evidence about the importance of stakeholders' protection and the distinctive effects of CG dimensions for corporate financial performance.

We investigate whether female presence on firms' board of commissioners and board of directors is associated with a higher dividend policy. Using panel data on 525 publicly listed firms in Indonesia between 2011 and 2018, we find that the impact of females' presence on firms' boards on dividend policy depends on their role as either an executive or a non-executive on the boards. Female directors are negatively associated with cash dividend payments, while female commissioners are positively associated with dividend payments in the case of only family-controlled firms. Our results provide insights into corporate governance practices in a two-tiered board system in a developing country. (c) 2021 PBank Indonesia Institute. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of CEO compensation for sample of the US firms. It emphasizes the presence of executive compensation persistence and the importance of CEO power besides performance while setting CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of US firms during the period 2006-2016. It is based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) models to assess the impact of numerous factors on CEO compensation. Findings: The main findings reveal that firm performance proxied by accounting-based proxies, as well as market-based proxies, plays a significant role in explaining variations in levels of executive compensation. Moreover, there is a significant persistence in executive compensation among the US sample firms. The authors also document that poor governance conditions (managerial power hypothesis) lead to high compensation levels offered to CEO. Research limitations/implications: At the end, without a doubt, the analysis has some limitations that prompt the authors to consider future research directions. One future research avenue that can help better explain the effect of firm performance on the CEO compensation is to study this issue using an international sample to determine whether country-level characteristics (e.g. creditor rights, shareholder rights and the enforcement climate) can influence this relationship. Furthermore, it can be worthwhile to deepen the analysis of CEO power and its impact on CEO compensation. It will be interesting to emphasize how the CEO power interacts with the other governance characteristics and some CEO attributes as CEO gender. Practical implications: The paper's findings have implications for practitioners, policymakers and regulatory authorities. First, the findings inform regulators that performance is not the only determinant of CEO pay level. This may warrant increased firm disclosure of the details of the pay structure. Second, the study offers insights to policymakers and members of boards of directors interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance, to better align managerial incentives to shareholder interests. Firms should strengthen the board independence and properly constitute the board committees (compensation, risk, nomination...). Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the CEO compensation determinants. It supplements the classic pay-for-performance sensitivity predictions with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory and managerial power theory. The authors develop a composite index to measure the CEO power in order to test the impact of CEO attributes on CEO pay. Additionally, it verifies whether the determinants of CEO pay depend on firm age and size. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study analyzes the relationship between governance and stock liquidity. It uses different variables of corporate board characteristics and test three proxies of a bid-ask spread. It also provides comprehensive and robust evidence for the association between the corporate board and stock liquidity in the pure order-driven Tunisian market. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample covering all financial firms in Tunisia (banks, insurances and leasing companies) from 2008 to 2019. It employs a panel data approach. Findings: The author finds a negative relationship between board sizes, financial institutional members in corporate board and bid-ask spread (absolute, relative and effective spread). The author suggests that better-managed firms have greatly improved their stock liquidity and lower trading cost. The empirical results reveal that better corporate governance firms improve stock liquidity since it is associated with higher information disclosure. Practical implications: This research encourages Tunisian firms to develop their governance mechanisms and restructure their board organization to improve stock liquidity. It can support the regulators to simultaneously design appropriate governance recommendations, disclosure policies and trading regulations. Originality/value: The author presents empirical evidence of the role of corporate board on the bid-ask spread in an emerging market. The research is the first to analyze the corporate board characteristics using seven variables representatives of the board of directors and without using the governance index.

The purpose of this study is to gather and analyze recent research publications on the relationship between governance (board, audit, and ownership) and financial and corporate value. A rigorous literature review of current international articles is used in this paper. The meta-analysis method was utilized to examine papers published in high-evaluation scientific publications indexed in Scopus. The tool (WordStat 8) was utilized to study articles and summarize descriptive statistics, correlation, and keyword cloud during the analysis process. According to the study, the board of directors works to protect investments from misappropriation by actively participating in the development of the company's strategy, giving appropriate incentives to management, and monitoring and evaluating its performance, thus maximizing the company's value. The audit committee can be used as a governance mechanism to improve financial information confidence and openness. Through their participation in the financial statement preparation process as well as improving the independence of both internal and external auditors, the audit committee can help prevent future financial disasters. The study discovered that the emphasis on a company's ownership is critical, and that focusing on the largest shareholder can considerably boost the company's long-term profitability. As a result, it is obvious that the current shifts in ownership focus will diminish performance, but that the negative effects will fade with time and may even have a beneficial impact on the organization's performance. The study will benefit a variety of stakeholders, including investors, stakeholders, company CEOs, board of directors, and other connected groups. Furthermore, guiding shareholders, investors, and stakeholders to make decisions based on reasonable and objective foundations follows a true assessment of the company's market value. This study offers both academics and professionals a written review of the study as well as an updated reference index to measure the relationship between governance and financial success from 2017 to 2020.

Ownership concentration remains a salient institutional feature among public listed firms in emerging and transitional economies. This study examines how a listed firm's ownership concentration interacts with its governance mechanisms in shaping corporate R&D investments. By analyzing panel data of Chinese listed firms between 2010 and 2012, I have three core findings. First, ownership concentration by the largest controlling shareholder negatively affects a firm's R&D intensity, but a small team of shareholders' ownership concentration plays a positive role. Second, a firm's monitoring mechanisms (measured by its sizes of the board and independent directors) and CEO stockholding positively affect the firm's R&D input. Third, CEO stockholding's positive role in promoting firm R&D is stronger in the firms with a more dispersed ownership structure. This study discloses the ways ownership concentration influences corporate governance and, in turn, affects corporate innovation. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

There is a great deal of variation in how countries regulate the relationships between politicians and public-traded firms, but little evidence about how such policies affect firm performance. In 2013, China passed a new regulation that banned politicians from serving on the boards of directors of companies. Using a novel data set that links board members, government officials, and forced resignations, I estimate the effect of the policy on firm performance and stock returns. I find that the loss of a high-level politician significantly reduces a firm's cumulative stock return and future profits. The effect is driven by officials from government-controlled public sectors and is larger when the firm is in low-marketized areas. The analysis provides important evidence about the efficacy of a commonly used policy tool for reducing political influence in the private sector.

This paper focused on the concept of corporate governance based on shareholders' and stakeholders' perspectives and the development of corporate governance around the world, including the UK, the US, and Australia. The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance were presented, including shareholders' rights, the equitable treatment of shareholders, disclosure and stakeholders' rights and transparency practices, and the responsibilities of board of directors. Numerous corporate collapses have highlighted the call for the management and directors of companies to be more accountable, and they have led governments and international organisations such as the OECD to be more active in establishing principles of corporate governance. It was concluded that the system of corporate governance has increased in different countries in relation to the nature of the economy, legal systems, and cultural norms. (c) 2021 by Author.

Adopting agency and stakeholders theories, this study aims to investigate the relationship between corporate governance attributes (board size, board independence, female directors, and CEO duality) and sustainability reporting conduct in China. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 10,330 firm-year observations of Chinese listed companies over the period from 2015 to 2018. Data are supplied by WIND and CSMAR databases, whilst regression analysis is applied to test the hypotheses. Results indicate that board size and board independence were found to be positively associated with the sustainability reporting conduct, while female directors and CEO duality both do not have a significant effect on sustainability reporting conduct in the Chinese institutional settings. This paper advances on arguments of the agency and stakeholders theories with these findings. The larger and more independent board facilitates better monitoring of the managers, what leads to decision-making based on a more appreciation of stakeholders' perspectives. The study is premised on the presence/absence of sustainability reporting, and it does not take into consideration the quality aspect, which can result in erroneous interpretation. The results should not be generalized as the sample was based on China's companies for 2015-2018. This study has policy implications for managers and policymakers alike concerning designing board composition conducive to sustainability reporting conduct. (c) 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

We investigate the nexus between board composition and corporate performance of Nigerian banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2010 to 2019. The contextual board characteristics of empirical interest include board size, financial knowledge of board members, frequency of board meetings, gender diversity and board independence. Corporate performance is measured by return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS). Our findings lead to the predictions that board size, financial nous of board members, gender diversity and board independence are important board characteristics that catalyse corporate performance, although the evidence of gender diversity and board independence is limited. We find no robust relation between the frequency of board meetings and corporate performance. Our findings affirm the plurality of governance theories. Although board characteristics are in aggregate perceived to be a strong determinant of firm performance, however, their disaggregation depicts differential effects on the performance of Nigerian banks. The study contributes to (a) empirical validation of theoretical pluralism to gain more insights into the dimensions of corporate governance, and (b) greater understanding of the nexus between board composition and corporate performance through the lens of both financial and nonfinancial factors. The fact that some board characteristics exhibit no or partial relations with firm performance suggests further research in and regulatory attention to the relations between board structure and optimal size for efficient corporate performance.

This work aims to analyze the relationship between board independence and financial performance (variables ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q). Two perspectives on independence were used: (a) Law 964 of 2005 (mandatory in the Colombian stock market) and (b) an expanded view that included business relationships (cross-directorships, seniority on the board), financial relationships (compensation packages, ownership participation), and personal relationships (founders, members of the owner family) as factors that limit independence. Regression models (random effects) were used on an unbalanced data panel composed of 69 companies from the Colombian Stock Exchange. The results showed that a more rigorous definition of independence is better appreciated by the market. It was found that board independence does not affect accounting performance (ROA and ROE), but it does affect market performance (Tobin's Q). (c) 2021 Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the effects of a board's diversity on firm financial performance using a sample of 76 companies listed on FTSE100 over the period 2010-2015. This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. (c) 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

This paper draws on the articles in the Forum on Corporate Governance to discuss how corporate governance and accounting research complement each other well in explaining how companies are governed as well as properly managed from an accounting point of view. We put special attention to the cross-national differences in both corporate governance systems and accounting practice and how that affect multiple organizational outcomes ranging from financial performance to corporate social performance and reporting quality.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

Using a sample of 47 Portuguese and Spanish firms for the period 2010 to 2017, the authors study the relationship between female presence on board and firm's accounting (ROA and ROE) and market-based (MTB and Tobin's Q) performance. They find that women on the board of directors is positively related to firm's performance, as well as the gender of the CFO and the proportion of women on the listed key professionals, when we consider the market measures of performance, not being so consistent for accounting performance measures. Results were sensitive to the performance measure used. The results reinforce the political options of European Commission gender established quotas, revealing that in the Iberian countries these quotas are not being effectively implemented, even if results suggest that women on board in fact exert positive influence over market performance. This also led us to think that financial markets may also react in a positive way when the CFO of the company is a woman instead of a man, despite the sample limitations both in terms of gender and number of firms.

Much effort has been expended by the regulators in Jordan to enhance the code of corporate governance (CG); however, the effectiveness of CG mechanisms in monitoring management and enhancing the value of a firm is still a puzzle. This study aims to investigate the impact of CG and cash holdings (CH) on firm value as measured by the market-to-book ratio. The sample consists of all manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the years 2010-2017. The study hypotheses were tested using panel regression analysis. The research findings suggest that CH have a positive association with firm value, supporting the transaction and precautionary motives for holding cash. An interesting finding is that board expertise was found to be negatively associated with firm value. Gender diversity was found to be positively related to firm value, while board size, independence, and frequency of meetings were found to be insignificant. It seems that firms in Jordan regard strong CG mechanisms to be expensive and of little value in mitigating the negative effects of a weak legal system. These findings shed new light on the influence (or the lack of it) of boards in Jordanian firms. Consequently, the study recommends that the regulatory agencies in Jordan should consider improving governance codes and Rules to increase the effectiveness of the board and governance in general.

Purpose: We analyzed the impact of board directors with foreign experience on the accounting and market performance of companies listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3). Originality/value: We show unpublished empirical evidence about the relationship between the foreign experience of board directors and the performance of Brazilian firms. Knowing this relationship better contributes to the formulation of internal policies for the qualification of senior management, in addition to being valuable to shareholders, especially in a context of weak legal protection, as it is in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: We collected data from 230 companies between 2010 and 2016, submitted it to unbalanced panel data regressions using the Systemic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM-Sys). Findings: The results suggest that the higher the proportion of board members with academic and professional foreign experience, the lower their accounting and market performance. This finding can be justified by institutional isomorphism, in which having an experience abroad would be a myth, a status institutionalized by the Brazilian society. In addition, foreign owners and directors face cultural barriers and would have less knowledge of the local environment, which would increase information asymmetries, impacting negatively in firms' performance. On the other hand, an increase in the number of foreigners on the board positively influences the market value of companies, since, by having weaker local power networks and, consequently, less possibility to obtain private benefits, the investors could value companies with this characteristic.

This study examines the influence of corporate board monitoring on real earnings management practice in Nigeria. It also explores whether the presence of politically connected directors weakens/strengthen the board by using 385 firm-year observations of listed companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for the period between 2012 and 2016. The study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard error regression to estimate the model parameters. The results show that politically connected directors have significant positive influence on real earnings manipulations. We also establish that the interaction of politically connected directors with the board weakened the board monitoring power, and thus led to breach of corporate governance. The results also indicate that foreign CEOs and CEOs with financial expertise decrease the propensity of real earnings manipulations in Nigeria. Hence, we draw the attention of regulators to improve the independence of the board in order to control politically connected directors from weakening the board monitoring power.

This study explored the varied characteristics of misstatement firms, which serve as the foundation to develop a model that predicts income-decreasing forced restatement (IDFR). Multivariate logit regression was performed on 4,698 firm-years of Malaysian listed firms from 2002 to 2012. The results were tested for robustness using a stepwise logit model and a penalised likelihood logit model. Several factors, such as share price volatility, independent board of directors, company's internal fund, and political connection, emerged as the main predictors for IDFR. This study proposes a prediction model that synthesises financial and non-financial aspects in terms of scaled probability (F-score), which may function as a red flag of income-increasing misstatement firms that warrant further investigation.

This study examines how providing directors with directors' and officers' liability insurance (DOLI) affects the busyness of a firm's board of directors, using data from 1,532 non-financial firms listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and the Taipei Exchange (TPEx) from 2008 to 2018. Providing DOLI may help recruitment and retention of directors and management and strengthen financial protection of firms and individuals when facing litigation. Providing DOLI, however, might lead to moral hazard problems and opportunistic behaviors, such as causing directors to neglect their duties and hold more positions in other institutions, resulting in a higher degree of board busyness. Empirically, after controlling for the quality of the directors and governance of the firms, a significant positive relationship exists between DOLI and board busyness, confirming the moral hazard problem.

This paper examines factors that determine the presence of minority directors (i.e., directors who are related to minority shareholders) on board of directors in banks with concentrated ownership structure. Using a panel of controlled European banks for the period 2011-2017, our results show that the voting rights of large shareholders increase the presence of minority directors on bank boards. We also find that the large shareholders promote the presence of minority directors on bank boards when the degree of opacity of the bank is high and the level of shareholder protection of the country where the bank is located is strong.

In this chapter, I analyze the main characteristics of family-controlled firms. In the first part of this chapter, I provide a literature review and the main definitions of family-controlled firms, and in the second part, I introduce the impact that family firms can have on the composition of the board of directors according to the literature. In particular, I highlight that recent studies indicate that family firms pursue different goals from nonfamily-controlled firms. To be precise, they select board members to import the knowledge that may be lacking among family members sitting on the board. In the final part of this chapter, I present the main characteristics of Italian family-controlled firms. I first focus on the geographical distribution and on the role of the industrial districts and then highlight the main sectors in which these firms operate.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, an analysis of the direct effect of ownership structure and boards of directors on insider trading. Secondly, we examine the possible moderating effect the concentration of ownership has on the disciplinary role of boards in preventing this market practice. The results of the multiple regression and hierarchical multiple regression show the negative effect of both concentration of property and the portion of independent directors on insider trading. Regarding the moderating effect, there is evidence that the controlling roles on the boards are influenced by the concentration of property. (c) 2021, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

This article analyses the impact of employee shareholding and participation in governance bodies on the performance and cash distribution policy of French companies. This empirical work is based on data from a combination of three sources (IODS, Eikon and Thomson Reuters) for a sample of listed companies in France over the period 2000-2014. Our results indicate that employee participation in corporate governance has various effects: Employee shareholding makes it possible to increase the profitability of companies but it also allows for the curbing of their dividend payment and share buyback practices. At the same time, employee participation in the board of directors (or supervisory board) moderates the payment of dividends to shareholders. These results form part of the discussion on the renewal of corporate governance and the development of cash distribution policy.

Firms can curb managerial opportunistic behaviours through applying corporate governance mechanisms effectively. Using a sample of 114 Jordanian firms listed on ASE for the period from 2009 until 2015, this study investigates the combined effect of the board of directors and family ownership on the discretionary accruals. The results show that the higher effectiveness of board of directors plays a higher monitoring role to minimise discretionary accruals practices as one of the opportunistic-behaviours. Results also show that the monitoring role of the board of directors is positively moderated in firms with family ownership. This proves that board of directors as a whole in firms with family ownership is unlikely to be effective. This indicates that the corporate governance plays a pivotal role in mitigating the opportunistic behaviours and minimises the divergence gap under the traditional agency problem while it has become a legal fiction when the central-agency problem exists.

The research paper studies the present ownership structure of S&P BSE 500 Indian listed firms in order to take heed of the expected level of shareholder engagement and the level of governance practices of such firms. The paper employs a cluster analysis approach to identify the distinct cluster or group of firms with probably similar level of shareholder engagement and governance practices. It is found that ownership of publicly listed companies is concentrated in the hands of Indian promoters and non-promoter institutional shareholders. Thus, the institutional investors have become important owners alongside the Indian promoters and can play dominant role in the control and management of the firms they invest in. They would help to enhance corporate governance practices via shareholder activism and engagement. The study is relevant for board of directors (BOD), institutional investors and policy makers, regulators, think tanks, corporates, investors and researchers.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose an implementation framework for governance in the Ghanaian securities trading industry. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research approach was followed, using participatory action research (PAR) by involving stakeholders from the Ghanaian securities trading industry. Findings: A governance framework for the Ghanaian securities trading industry is proposed, taking into account the regulatory environment of Ghana, the role of ethical leadership, boards of directors, audit committees, the governance of risk, information technology and internal audit. Research limitations/implications: This study used PAR because it is a recognised research methodology aimed at problem resolution, knowledge creation and improving professional practice, through the involvement of the interest group. This paper provides a starting point - a practical solution for the securities industry of Ghana, but not generalisable results. Practical implications: Applying the governance framework will create safeguards against corruption and mismanagement, promote transparency in economic life and assist Ghana in attracting investment, ultimately lowering its cost of capital and contributing to economic growth and development in the country. Social implications: The implementation of the governance framework will benefit all stakeholders (employees, suppliers and the community at large) as a result of a culture conducive to influencing behaviour, strategy planning and implementation, as well as corporate results and financial sustainability. Originality/value: The use of PAR assists the practitioners from the Ghanaian securities trading industry in improving their competencies (knowledge, skills, values and attributes) whilst generating a workable solution for their current governance challenges.

This study empirically examines the influence of climate change management on banks' profitability using panel data of a sample of 137 banks from 36 emerging and developed countries during the period 2011-2019, using the Generalized Method of Moments. Our empirical evidence shows that, although banks seem to be aware of the consequences of climate change on their business, to the point of making it a strategic topic worthy of the board of directors, they remain very timid in terms of operational implementation. It leads to a positive impact on profitability limited to the overall quality of climate change management and disclosure and an ex-post justification of the topic's relevance to the board. The foreseeable introduction of new banking regulations and the current weak relationship between climate change managerial practices and financial performance should encourage banks to pay greater attention to these practices to preserve their future returns.

This paper aims to assess the effect of corporate governance mechanisms, including board members' and audit committee members' characteristics, particularly their independence, expertise in terms of finance and industry and efforts on the level of fraud and money laundering (ML) in financial statements of the listed firm on the Tehran Stock Exchange. The procedure of the study is descriptive correlation based on published information from firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020, using a sample of 154 firms with 1071 observations. The method used for hypothesis testing is linear regression using panel data. The Benish model is used measure the level of fraud in financial statements, and for ML, the auditors' opinion are used. The results show that board characteristics, including independence, financial expertise, industry expertise and board effort, as well as audit committee features, such as independence, financial expertise, industry expertise and audit committee effort, have a significant and negative impact on the fraudulent financial reporting and ML. Moreover, since this paper was carried out in an emerging financial market, particularly in Iran, to figure out the effect of corporate governance structures on financial statement fraud and ML, it can provide helpful information for investors and policymakers in this regard.

This study examines whether the board of directors' compensation schemes affect stock market valuations for banks in a dual banking system (Islamic and conventional banks). We employ an international sample of 11 countries for the period 2010-2015. Our results show that for the full sample (i.e. irrespective of the bank type), board of directors' compensation has a significant and positive impact on stock market valuations. For different bank types, we find that the positive effect of the board of directors' compensation on market valuations holds only for conventional banks, with insignificant evidence for their Islamic counterparts. We, also, examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory board's compensation on Islamic banks value. Our results show that investors positively perceived and priced information related to this boards' compensation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study investigates the effect of the board of directors on financial performance and company capital, either directly or indirectly with the risk management in Indonesia. Design/methodology: This study presents an empirical investigation with samples of 31 nonfinancial companies out of a total population of 48 listed on the Indonesia stock exchange for the period from 2010 and 2016. The sampling method used was purposive sampling. Methods of data analysis in this study used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings: The results of the SEM model find that there is a significant positive effect of risk management and the tenure-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on financial performance and company capital. However, CEO duality has a significant negative effect on financial performance. The results also find that the effect of CEO duality and board size are significantly positive on financial performance through risk management. Originality/value: This is the first-time paper to seek to influence the effect of the board of directors, financial performance, and company capital, either directly or indirectly on risk management in Indonesia.

The growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues is the result of a cultural path that sees banks react to market changes and become protagonists of an increasingly sustainable future. Based on these considerations, this paper intends to investigate the level of integration of sustainability issues in banks' corporate governance systems. We carry out an exploratory analysis on all European systematically important banks during the period 2015-2019. By adopting the content analysis approach, we develop a novel governance score based on a research model made up of 40 items. We name the score: "Bank's governance ESG (Environmental Social Governance) integrated index". The main results of our study reveal not only growing awareness of banks to integrate sustainability in their corporate governance, but also a strong heterogeneity in their corporate behaviours and large rooms for improvement. Indeed, we find that just over half of the surveyed banks pay really attention to the integration of sustainability issues in their business and governance processes. This contribution is especially driven by the banks' boards of directors, whose size and composition contribute positively to overall sustainable performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates the level of integration of ESG factors in the banking sector, developing a quantitative score ranging from 0 to 100%. This study differs from previous studies in that it develops an "Bank's governance ESG integrated index", which considers the areas of corporate governance that have the greatest impact on the implementation of sustainable practices in banks. Our research is limited to investigating the level of integration of ESG factors for listed banks over a 5-year period. In fact, our time horizon is represented by the four-year period 2015-2019. This research has practical implications. First, investors more attentive on sustainability issues could identify and select the banks that best implement ESG criteria in their corporate governance systems. Second, our research model could be adopted by banks as a "diagnostic tool" to carry out a self-assessment process and identify possible room for improvement. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between family managers and firms' risk levels in a context characterized by low investor protection and firm opacity. Specifically, this paper examines whether the level of risk faced by firms is affected by family shareholders' ownership stake and activism. Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance data were hand-collected for a sample of 90 Italian listed companies and 540 observations from the year 2018. Regression analysis was then used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: This study provides evidence of a positive association between active family ownership and risk faced by sampled firms. This study also finds that the number of inside directors is negatively correlated with firms' risk-taking. Overall, the results confirm family managers' influence on firms' risk choices and show consistency with theoretical arguments in favor of hiring professional managers to guide family-owned firms. Practical implications: Practical implications emerge from the study findings. First, family owners should consider to hire a larger number of professional managers to support firms' wealth maximization and retention and to reduce default risks. Second, investors should take into account the firms' board of directors and management composition to better assess the investments risk level. Finally, the positive correlation between active family owners and systematic risk suggests the opportunity for regulators to improve the legal requirements related to minority directors to increase their effectiveness and, therefore, minority shareholders' protection. Originality/value: This study extends the literature on the association between ownership structure and firms' risk levels, showing the effect of family managers on firms' risk levels. Besides, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study investigates professional executives' influence on risk when family ownership prevails.

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The direct nexus between board characteristics, earnings management (EM) practices and dividend payout is examined in this study, followed by an examination of the indirect mediation impact of EM practices in the nexus between board characteristics and dividend payout. It aims to provide new empirical evidence from the Jordanian market, which is an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study population consists of all service firms that were listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) between 2012 and 2019. Due to the lack of availability of their complete data during the period, four service firms were omitted from the population; hence, a sample of 43 service firms was acquired over the time frame (2012-2019), yielding a total of 344 firm-year observations. Moreover, panel data analysis was employed in this study, and data for the study were acquired from yearly reports as well as the ASE's database. Findings: Based on the GMM estimator findings, board size and independence have a negative and significant influence on the EM, but CEO/chairman duality has a positive and significant impact. Simultaneously, the impacts of female representation on the board of directors and the number of board meetings were both positive but insignificant. The findings also found that four board characteristics, including board size, female representation on the board of directors, CEO/chairman duality and the number of board meetings, had a significant negative or positive effect on dividend payout, while board independence did not. Additional findings show that EM practices have a direct negative insignificant effect on dividend payout, whereas EM practices partially mediate the relationship between board characteristics and dividend payout. Research limitations/implications: The current study's limitation is that it only searched in Jordanian service firms listed on ASE from 2012 to 2019 to fulfill the study's objectives; thus, we urge that future work explores the study models for other sectors, whether in Jordan or other growing markets such as the Middle East and North Africa. Practical implications: The findings of this study may be utilized by analysts, investors and other strategic decision-makers to enhance Jordan's financial market's efficiency and efficacy. These findings will improve policymakers' willingness to impose appropriate constraints, perhaps boosting Jordan's financial market performance and efficacy. These findings may also help investors make more enlightened judgments by utilizing board characteristics and EM factors that predict firm dividend policy. Originality/value: Contradictions in the results of earlier investigations inspired the current study, with the findings filling a gap in the existing literature. This study differs from previous studies by constructing a novel research model and analyzing the mediating influence of EM in the nexus between board characteristics and dividend payout.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether and how managerial ability is associated with the relation between product market competition and earnings management. The authors argue that high-ability managers may moderate the underlying relations in both directions, and they are likely to trade off relative costs between accrual-based earnings management (AEM) and real earnings management (REM). Design/methodology/approach: This study uses ordinary least square regressions to examine the association of managerial ability on the relations between product market competition and earnings management. The paper follows prior literature to measure managerial ability, product market competition and earnings management. Findings: This study shows empirical evidence that high-ability managers in high-competition industries are likely to engage in AEM but less likely to engage in REM. These findings overall indicate that high-ability managers in high-competition industries trade-off between different forms of earnings management based on their relative costliness and choose the one that is relatively less costly. Practical implications: This study has important practical implications as the findings identify situations when important stakeholders, such as the board of directors and investors, may take precautions to prevent managers' opportunistic behaviors. The findings of this study also might be helpful for firms when it comes to selecting managers. The findings may provide some input to the firms in considering the risks and benefits trade-offs of recruiting a high versus low-ability manager in a more or less competitive environment. Originality/value: The findings of this study show new insight into how managerial ability moderates the relation between product market competition and different types (i.e. accrual-based and real activity-based) of earnings management.

Oman Vision 2040 is the blueprint for Oman's future aspirations. This vision is set with a number of high-level long-term targets to reflect the desired progress towards the strategic goals, in order to direct all Omani companies to build productive strategies and innovative plans to diversify the country's economy and reduce the dependence on the oil sector. All Omani companies are required to move according to this path by disclosing forward-looking information and goals in their annual reports. The progress will be monitored by the Vision 2040 Follow Up Unit which will report regularly on the targets. Therefore, our paper examines whether the presence of ruling family members on boards of directors impacts the quality and tone of forward-looking disclosure (FLD). Based on the sample of 34 Omani financial listed firms on Muscat Stock Exchange between 2014 and 2020, we found that there is a positive and significant association between politically connected firms and FLD quality. This confirms prior literature that politically connected firms are considered more transparent than their non-connected peers. We also found that firms with ruling family board members disclose more good forward-looking news in the chairman's statements. Furthermore, in the case of poor financial performance firms, we found that ruling members tend to disclose more good news than bad news, and they could use impression management techniques to avoid the negative attraction and to maintain their reputation in the market. From these findings, we draw important implications for policymakers and shareholders who need to encourage firms to appoint ruling family directors on their boards (to a specific extent) due to the potential beneficial outcomes they deliver.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study examines the effect of non-financial variables related to governance on the accuracy of financial distress prediction among Egyptian listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by using the logistic regression technique. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a sample of 24 Egyptian-listed SMEs in each year, totaling 120 firm observations, of which 25 were classified distressed and 95 of them non-distressed between 2014 and 2018. The variables for the study included five financial variables and thirteen non-financial variables related to governance. The models were developed using financial variables alone as well as combining financial and non-financial variables related to governance. Findings: The results showed that the model with financial variables had a prediction accuracy of 91.7%, whereas models with a combination of financial and non-financial variables related to governance predict with comparatively better accuracy of 92.7 and 93.6%. Research limitations/implications: Although the results seem to be conclusive, it could be noted that the non-distressed sample was not paired with the distressed sample. Other studies showed that paired samples increase the financial distress prediction rate. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, this study was unable to create a hold-out sub-sample for the accuracy test. Practical implications: The proposed distress prediction model for SMEs is effective for stakeholders, including banks and other financial institutions, in the assessment of the credit risk of SMEs. Using such a model, they could better identify SMEs with a higher risk of failure in their lending decisions. Moreover, SME managers' could be interested in using such models as a tool for planning corrective action, in addition to planning and controlling current operations to avoid financial failure in the future. Originality/value: This study contributes to financial distress prediction literature in different ways. First, few studies were conducted in the area of financial distress among SMEs. Second, neither of these studies was conducted within the Egyptian context, nor any of them had used non-financial variables related to governance in the prediction of financial distress among SMEs.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

This paper examines the effect of the family involvement in the performance of Greek listed companies, during the Greek financial crisis. The involvement of family in firm's ownership, management and governance along with the firm's age constitute the unified framework that describe the family influence on the enterprise. The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of a research period when Greece faced an unprecedented economic 9 year crisis that affected all sectors of the economy, with 72% of listed companies showing a decrease in revenue and the total capitalization of the Greek Stock Exchange shrinking by 70%. No previous study has incorporated performance data on listed companies during a corresponding financial crisis with large fluctuations in all performance indicators and a high volatility in the national economy. The sample of the research includes 80 family firms listed in the Greek Stock Exchange. The findings illustrate a better performance for family firms with lower family ownership and prove a stronger performance in younger family businesses. The results of the study do not confirm the positive involvement of family members, through management (CEO) and governance (BoD) positions in the family business performance.

Purpose: Despite the rather adequate physical and human resources available to Iranian state-owned enterprises (SOEs), they have proved not only unproductive and unprofitable but also corrupt in cases due to their corporate governance (CG) systems. This study aims to identify the most important challenges faced within designing, implementing and operating such systems in Iranian SOEs. Design/methodology/approach: A judgmental sampling technique was adopted for the purposes of the present qualitative study to select a heterogeneous group of interviewees in terms of experience and expert knowledge in CG and SOEs. Using 28 semi-structured interviews and the thematic analysis methodology within an exploratory approach, the themes/challenges were extracted from the data thus collected that were subsequently analyzed and explicated. Findings: The 16 challenges derived from the data set were subsequently classified into the four categories of "general assembly deficiencies", "contextual issues of ownership", "board deficiencies" and "external managerial constraints". Research limitations/implications: This study aims to provide insights into policy-making systems at both national and international levels to gain a better understanding of the contextual factors that could be exploited toward developing and/or reforming CG codes. To improve SOEs, this study also suggests four main solutions to the CG challenges faced within Iran and similar centralized economic planning systems. Originality/value: The literature on the topic indicates that while a few theoretical and empirical studies have been conducted on CG of SOEs, no study has ever been conducted on similar Iranian cases. The present study provides ample empirical evidence from the CG systems in a state-controlled and centralized economic system to offer new insights into the comparative CG, especially in a developing country like Iran, where the government is the major player in the economy.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: This paper investigates the role of board independence in determining the relationship between firm ownership and auditor choice. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a logistic regression to test the direct and indirect effects of ownership structure on the decision to hire a high-quality (Big 4) audit firm. The sample consists of 207 non-financial firms listed on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries stock markets between 2009 and 2016. Findings: Empirical findings show that family ownership is associated with a negative and significant coefficient suggesting that an increase in family ownership decreases the likelihood that the firm will employ a Big 4 auditor. This finding suggests that family owners are reluctant to impose external monitoring. Furthermore, we find a positive relationship between institutional ownership and auditor choice supporting the conjecture that institutional investors are more likely to choose a Big 4 auditor. The results also reveal that the effects of family and institutional ownership on auditor choice are partially mediated by independent directors. Practical implications: This study has important implications for GCC economies whose policymakers and regulators may need to address the conflict between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. It provides guidance for firms in the construction and implementation of their own corporate governance policies. Furthermore, the study findings may be useful to investors, assisting them in making better informed decisions and aids other interested parties in gaining a better understanding of the role played by ownership structure in the quality of auditors. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of the composition of the board of directors in increasing the likelihood of hiring a high-quality audit firm. Originality/value: The main contribution of the present paper is to examine the board composition as a potential mediating variable between ownership structure and auditor choice. Moreover, it highlights the issue of improving governance mechanisms. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

There have recently been many calls to explore corporate governance in emerging economies, as these countries have distinctive characteristics such as a weaker institutional environment and the dominating influence of controlling shareholders. The literature has revealed that, in such institutional settings, there is the risk that powerful insiders maximize their own benefits at the expense of minorities and firm performance. This study advances our knowledge of corporate governance in emerging economies by exploring the moderating impact of quad-qualified directors - i.e., directors with independence, expertise, bandwidth, and motivation - on the relationship between dominant-owner CEOs and firm performance. We tested our hypotheses on a large cross-sectional sample of Indian listed firms. Our results show that dominant-owner CEOs undermine company performance, but quad-qualified directors may improve board monitoring and consequently attenuate their negative influence. Our findings support the soundness of the quad-qualified model for boards of directors, and contribute to the growing literature investigating which directors' attributes may have a significant impact on board monitoring and firm performance.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

The US entrepreneurial finance market has changed dramatically over the last two decades. Entrepreneurs who raise their first round of venture capital retain 30% more equity in their firm and are more likely to control their board of directors. Late-stage start-ups are raising larger amounts of capital in the private markets from a growing pool of traditional and new investors. These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public - and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms. Next, we review several regulatory, technological, and competitive changes affecting both start-ups and investors that help explain how the trade-offs between going public and staying private have changed. We conclude by listing several open research questions. (c) 2022 by Annual Reviews.

Purpose: Although the previous literature considers independent directors as an internal mechanism for good corporate governance and higher financial disclosure quality, in contexts characterized by high ownership concentration, they may lack the mandate, the incentives and the ability to be an effective monitoring mechanism. Therefore, this study aims to focus on minority directors and investigate their impact on the earnings management activities for firms with concentrated ownership structures. Design/methodology/approach: As the slate voting system is a peculiar feature of Italian corporate governance regulations, which gives minority shareholders the right to appoint at least one member of the board of directors (minority directors), this paper carries out a quantitative empirical analysis based on a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange to test the role played by minority directors in increasing incentives towards higher financial reporting quality. Findings: Robust to different model specifications, including the endogeneity test, empirical findings show a negative relationship between minority directors and earnings management, while no relationship holds between the latter and independent directors, suggesting that minority directors might promote greater directors' accountability than independent directors in highly concentrated ownership structures. Originality/value: Relying on the empirical findings, this paper offers new insights on a peculiar internal corporate governance mechanism related to one of the most debated issues among financial market practitioners and regulators, namely, the protection of minority shareholders. Moreover, this paper offers new insights for academics and practitioners on a peculiar governance mechanism that could soon be widely adopted. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although acquisition strategies have been widely used by firms, past research has suggested that this type of strategic tactic can be risky, hence top management must justify this decision. Top management can engage in hubristic behaviors to do so. Therefore, we investigate if it is possible to identify the hubristic managerial before the decision is implemented, and how hubristic behaviors by the managers impact the long-term market performance of the firm. Using a sample of 11 596 firms over a span of 27 years, we found that managers actively manipulate firm performance prior to an acquisition, the degree of manipulation affects the degree of long-term performance, and the top management's decision to purchase the asset will negatively affect firm organizational performance. We contribute to organizational strategic decision-making literature by showing that managers may act with hubris in acquisitions decisions and that this hubris is predictable. Our results also suggest that top managers in pursuit of a corporate acquisition will need to justify their decision making to the board of directors by illustrating their success in managing the firm through high firm performance.

This article studies, over the period 2006 to 2019, both the structure and the evolution of corporate networks built on shared board directors between the largest listed firms of three European countries: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It offers a longitudinal and up-to-date analysis of the state of links between companies through examining interlocking directorates. Contrary to previous studies which have emphasized a decline of interlocks when analyzed at the board director level, we observe relative stability of these networks at the corporate level with a number of connected firms remaining quite stable despite a decline of board ties. As a result, the most central companies remain mainly the same at the national and international level over the considered period. Our findings provide evidence for the resource perspective: access to key resources seemingly pushes firms to continue their network participation despite strengthened national regulations on directors with multiple board seats. This evolution echoes the concept of weak ties of Granovetter (Am J Sociol 78: 360-1380, 1973). Lastly, it is worth noting that it cannot be affirmed that there has been an emergence of a cross-national network which operates to substitute national board ties.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the failed finance companies in Sri Lanka used fair value accounting practices as an opportunistic earnings management practice to launder money under weak corporate governance structures. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a qualitative design under the philosophy of interpretivism. The case study research strategy is used inductively to investigate how fair value accounting had been used for money laundering. Findings: The dishonest intention of major shareholders and board of directors had forced failed companies to misuse fair value accounting to manipulate performance and use them for personal benefits which were detrimental to the depositors and stability of the companies. The weak corporate governance structures which were developed because of regulatory forbearance were influential for manipulations. The concentrated ownership had reduced agency conflicts between shareholders and managers because major shareholders were the members of the board of directors. The appointed committees were not effective because of an inadequate number of independent directors with sufficient expertise. The reduced agency conflict between shareholders and managers has exaggerated the agency conflict with depositors. Therefore, it is recommended to dilute ownership concentration to establish good corporate governance structures and make stable institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study does not discuss the dishonest fair value accounting practices of all licensed finance companies because of the sensitivity of the matter for surviving companies. Originality/value: This paper is an original work of the authors which discusses how fair value accounting practices had been used to launder money in failed finance companies in Sri Lanka as an emerging market context.

The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of corporate governance structures on earnings management behavior in a weakly governed and politically unstable environment. A panel of data from 35 non-bank companies listed on the Palestine Exchange between 2012 and 2019 was employed. A fixed effects regression model was used to examine the impact of certain board characteristics (board size, board meetings, and audit committee formation) and ownership structures (institutional ownership, foreign ownership, and ownership concentration) on earnings management in the volatile and risky political and economic environment of Palestine. The findings indicate that corporate governance and ownership systems in Palestine appear to be ineffective in constraining earnings management practices. None of the board attributes appear to constrain earnings management practices. However, there is weak evidence to show that ownership concentration has some effect in curbing earnings manipulation. The findings of this study are expected to increase awareness among Palestinian regulators, investors, and other policymakers regarding the role of boards of directors and institutional and foreign shareholders in monitoring Palestinian listed companies to enhance corporate governance and the quality of financial reporting.

Purpose: This study covers all banks listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. It used (1) dividend-paying status, dividend changes and dividend persistence to measure dividend quality, (2) a checklist instrument consisting of 40 items to measure financial disclosure quality, (3) nationality and (4) the percentage of females and males on the board of directors to measure board diversity. Hierarchical regression analysis was employed to investigate the influence of the board diversity on the relationship between financial disclosure quality and dividend quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates the relationship between financial disclosure quality and dividend quality among Jordanian-listed banks. Moreover, it examines the moderating effect of board diversity on the relationship between financial disclosure quality and dividend quality. Findings: The results in this work imply that banks with high financial disclosure quality have high-quality dividends. Furthermore, nationality and females on the board of directors play a main role as moderators that influence managers' motivations toward the quality of financial disclosure practices and bank dividends. This paper shows that the boards in Jordanian banks have not changed dividend policies and tend to follow a long-term fixed strategy for paying earnings. Originality/value: Because of the limited number of practical research on the nexus between financial disclosure quality and dividends quality, this study fills a gap in the literature by examining the relationship between them. In addition, a lack of research exists on the effects of board diversity on the nexus of financial disclosure quality and dividends quality. Therefore, this study makes an original contribution to the literature by using nationality and females and males on the board of directors as moderating variables to investigate the effects of board diversity on the relationship between financial disclosure quality and dividend quality among Jordanian banks.

Good governance should contribute to improving the company's performance by providing the board of directors with the opportunity to ensure that it acts in the best interests of the shareholders (Fan, Radhakrishnan, & Zhang, 2021). Governance codes, composed of a set of voluntary recommendations, have been developed throughout the world. To date, the question of their effectiveness remains largely open and debated in the international context, and in Morocco in particular. The objective of this paper is to study the influence of compliance with a governance code on performance management practices in Morocco. In particular, it explores whether there is an impact of the corporate governance code via a compliance score on performance management (sales manipulation, abnormal production costs and discretionary expenditure manipulation). This paper uses a panel of data from 54 listed Moroccan non-financial firms from 2013 to 2020. The results of the study show that listed firms have gradually increased their compliance with the code. It appears that some of the code's recommendations are more effective in managing results Furthermore, code compliance and the evolution of code compliance are negatively associated with accounting management and actual earnings management. The code's provisions on the management board and specialised committees seem to limit the management of results. These results seem to confirm the positive impact of the governance code on the quality of accounting results. (c) 2022 The Authors.

We provide a comprehensive study of how different corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate innovation. Using panel data regression analysis across a sample of more than 13,600 firm-years for firms based in the United States between 1996-2010, we find that entrenched boards, though commonly associated with lower firm value, actually generate substantial innovation. We find that busy boards hinder innovation unless they also have interlocking relationships. Conversely, interlocked directors enhance innovation, unless they are busy. Directors who are CEOs or Board Chairs at other companies hinder innovation. Interestingly, despite being significant determinants of firm value in other studies, director experience, independence and ownership are not related to innovation. In order to be innovative, firms should appoint directors to leverage their professional relationships and directors must have a long-term perspective. (c) 2022 by the authors.

Worldwide, recent corporate financial scandals have raised many questions in terms of risk management and governance of banks. This study examines the impact of risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms on bank performance. Focusing on a sample of large banks, we want to assess the effect of the board of directors and risk management committee features as well as the presence of a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) in the executive board on performance over the period 2006-2017. To examine this relation properly, we employ the system-GMM (Generalized Method of Moments). Results show the importance of the risk management committee in enhancing bank performance. We also find that the presence of a CRO in the bank's executive board decreases performance and that the lower the number of meetings, women, and independent members, the better the banks' performance. Most importantly, results show that establishing risk governance will make banks more profitable and sustainable for the future.

Purpose: Family ownership is very common for Jordanian businesses, leading to a high level of involvement of family members in company management. There continues to be intense discussion on the pros and cons of family ownership, particularly as it focuses corporate control within a small family group. The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance of family- and non-family-owned banks that appear on the Amman Stock Exchange over the 2016 to 2020 period. Design/methodology/approach: The research on Jordanian domestic banks is based on data from the annual reports of banks listed on their websites which offers comprehensive data on finances, ownership and the board. Family-owned and non-family banks were analysed using multiple regression technique to identify any variations in their performance. Findings: Using a sample of 16 domestic banks with 75 bank-year observations over the 2016 to 2020 period, the study supports other research in finding that family ownership is negatively related to bank performance. This is true for accounting-based and market-based performance measures, including return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q test results. Additionally, analysis identifies greater negative consequences for performance within family-owned banks by board of directors. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research on family businesses by investigating the impact of family ownership on the financial performance in the Jordanian bank sector. This research determined that devaluation is a consequence of higher levels of ownership concentration for domestic banks in Jordan. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

This study seeks to determine the impact of corporate governance dimensions (compliance with the corporate governance code, top management, control environment, transparency and disclosure, rights of shareholders and stakeholders) on the three main types of organizational commitment, (affective, continuance and normative). It also aims at examining the impact of organizational culture, as an intermediate variable, on the relationship between the two above mentioned variables. The sample of this study comprised 152 respondents working at five types of Jordanian companies. The results of the study have confirmed the positive effect of the three corporate governance dimensions (compliance with the corporate governance code, top management, and control environment) on three types of organizational commitment (affective, continuance, and normative). The results also confirmed that there is no significant effect of t transparency and disclosure and the rights of shareholders and stakeholders on affective and normative commitment. Key terms: Corporate governance, top management, Board of directors, management committee, control environment, transparency, disclosure, shareholders, and stakeholders. (c) 2022.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

This paper adopts the meta-analysis technique to a sample of 29 empirical articles to investigate the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and environmental disclosure. The paper also investigates whether the findings are moderated by differences in country-level factors, such as geographic location, rule of law, environmental policy stringency and the level of commitment to sustainable development goals, and differences in the measurement of environmental disclosure. The results reveal that board size, independence, gender diversity, environmental committee and board meetings significantly and positively influence environmental disclosure. In addition, the findings show that geographic location intervenes in the relationship between board size, independence, CEO duality and environmental disclosure. Finally, the relationship between board size, CEO duality, and environmental disclosure is moderated by the measurement of the dependent variable. (c) 2022 S. Pisano, L. Lepore, A. Celentano and F.

This is a comparative study on firm efficiency, a proxy for firm performance, between family-owned business (FOB) and non-family-owned business (non-FOB). This study aims to determine a firms' efficiency by comparing FOB and non-FOB in Southeast Asia countries. The efficiency ratios for five Southeast Asian countries were estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), before a two-sample T-test to determine the differences between FOBs and non-FOBs. Hence, secondary data research techniques from each country from 2007 to 2016 were used to conduct the comparison. The data were gathered from various sources. The findings did not archive any comparison in performance among FOBs and non-FOBs. This finding is fundamental for the Board of Director (BOD), senior management of the firms, researchers, policymakers, scholastics, and the overall population., Ceteris paribus, both FOB and non-FOB, ought to work at a similar efficiency even out and have the option to produce comparative returns for their shareholders. Subsequently, stakeholders can compare treatments to assist in alleviating the dependency on two unique treatments or strategies when managing FOB and non-FOB. In short, it could expand the BOD and management efficiency. (c) International Journal of Economics and Management. ISSN 1823-836X. e-ISSN 2600-9390.

This study analyses the role of a company's financial capacity and governance in improving its level of environmental engagement. The methodology used is based on applying regression analysis to panel data on 351 listed large European companies during the period 2007-2015. Firstly, the results show that the companies in the sample are fairly engaged in environmental protection with strong dispersion. Furthermore, it revealed that the financial capacity of a company has a significant effect on its level of engagement in environmental protection. Lastly, the results also show that a better quality of governance plays an important role in the decision to undertake actions leading to environmental protection. More specifically, the degree of management implication in the running of the business, the respect shown for shareholder rights, the effectiveness of the control exerted by the board of directors and the independence of the audit committee are the most important determining factors of environmental engagement.

The purpose of this study is to determine a system of indicators to assess the quality of corporate governance of Honduran banks. To achieve it, the importance attributed by bank supervisors and supervised bankers to the dimensions and indicators of Corporate Governance (CG) was deepened. Therefore, the differences between both groups were identified to create a CG quality index with indicators that exceed a global mean greater than 3.5 on the Likert scale of 1-5 and the relative weight of dimensions. The focus of this research is quantitative, with a correlational scope and a non-experimental, cross-sectional design. A survey was applied to officials of the banking system and bank supervisors, whose scale has reliability with a Cronbach's Alpha, 0.961 and the normality tests reflect acceptable scores (using the two-step model). The results indicate that the most important dimension is "relations with shareholders" with a relative weight of 20.73%, "effectiveness of the board of directors" (20.44%), "relations with stakeholders" (20.42%), "internal audit function..." (20.32%) and "salaries and benefits (18.09%). Likewise, 14% of the 70 proposed indicators obtained mean global scores higher than 3.5, which can be eliminated or analyzed in greater depth with a panel of experts. Also, the Student's t test revealed significant differences in the criteria of supervised and supervisors in four of five CG dimensions, accepting the researcher's hypothesis, which may be related to the role of the respondents.

Malaysia experienced unusual political turmoil during the general elections in 2008 (GE 2008) and 2013 (GE 2013). This study examines how such exogenous political shocks affect the stock price crash risk of politically connected firms (PCFs) compared to non-PCFs in Malaysia. The data for this study covers from the year 2002 to 2017. A balanced panel of 529 firms from 2002-2017 is used for analysis. This study finds that PCFs display a significantly lower stock price crash risk after GE 2008 and GE 2013 but not before GE 2008. However, the results are only applicable to the PCFs through the politically connected board of directors and businessmen. Further analysis reveals that increasing foreign (government) strategic free float shareholdings result in lower stock price crash risk of PCFs through the politically connected board of directors (government direct shareholdings). Our results provide several perspectives on the connection between stock price crash risk and political stability. (c) 2022, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we investigate the influence of corporate governance quality on the dividend policy of Asian emerging markets. First, we assess the level of corporate governance quality through a comprehensive index comprised of the combined board governance attributes (board of directors, ownership status, and progressive practices) and firm fundamentals through attributes of financial ratios. Then, using a sample of non-financial firms from the stock exchanges of the respective emerging markets (China, India, and Pakistan), our results depict firms' corporate governance quality as a relevant factor for dividend pay-out.

The study utilizes a large sample of listed and unlisted corporations from 24 EU countries over the period 2003-2018. Empirical evidence demonstrates a negative and significant impact of sustainability performance on executive compensation, corroborating the conflict-resolution hypothesis in the literature. Moreover, this negative association is manifested within firms which have established a voluntary sustainability committee, having a more strategic focus on sustainability performance. The results remain robust after controlling for endogeneity, the bidirectional association between sustainability and compensation, and other control variables. Finally, the chapter provides useful policy and managerial implications.

This chapter discusses corporate governance; they promote governance as a system by which companies and organizations are directed and controlled. Good governance involves a number of aspects that occur in the process of governing. Corporate governance policies and practices define the performance of an organization. The main pillars of corporate governance are accountability, transparency, fairness, and disclosure. The performance of companies and organizations in relation to these pillars determines their overall evaluation in terms of good governance. The definitions of governance and good governance are now folded into a discussion of corporate and nonprofit governance. The boards of directors play a significant role in the overall management and control of corporations and organizations. A corporate board of directors is generally the oversight body that ensures the company's performance meets the owners' or stakeholders' expectations and helps manage/resolve disputes in the process.

This article aims to summarise a significant number of previous qualitative and quantitative researches in order for scholars to reconsider their understanding of corporate governance mechanisms. The fundamental purpose of examining corporate governance practices is to define the way earnings management can be reduced. The findings show unclear conclusions concerning the board of directors' and the committee's characteristics on earnings management. That is why adopting corporate governance mechanisms strives for reducing the 'agency' problem. Furthermore, researchers can monitor the impact of corporate governance mechanisms by focusing on recent literature (2019, 2020, 2021). Future research in this area is therefore being promoted. Implementing corporate governance in companies is a given, as it can ensure their effectiveness and increase their credibility and prestige. Adopting corporate governance practices mitigates earnings management phenomena, and companies make the right decisions for their smoother operation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

This study uses human capital that shows the intangible asset's core in reducing the risk or improving firm performance to solve previous inconsistent results of women's role in firm performance. Thus, this paper examines the role of human capital as the mediator in the influence of gender diversity on credit risk in a rural bank. This examination involves 433 rural banks based on the purposive sampling method. The result reveals that higher gender diversity has higher human capital (a = 0.135, r = 0.005) and higher human capital has lower credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It also revealed that when gender diversity is controlled by human capital as a mediator on credit risk, gender diversity does not affect credit risk (a = -0.022, r = 0.625). However, human capital still affects credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It implies that the higher a woman on the board of directors, the lower the credit risk through her education competence. Women as organization leaders have high self-appreciation from organization members in implementing their strategies and supervising them. High credit risk in rural banks needs appropriate management as a part of an internal governance mechanism. This study contributes to gender diversity literature through the ability to manage risk in measuring women's role as strategic agents. This study also contributes to investor protection through the reputation of women on boards as monitoring agents.

Purpose: The authors examine whether internal corporate governance mechanisms are effective in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities, misclassification, and timing. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises of firms from an emerging market, India with data for years 2004 through 2015. The authors use the methodology given in Roychowdhury (2006). Findings: The authors find that corporate boards in India play an active role in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities but fail to control cash flow manipulation through misclassification and timing. Practical implications: The study suggests that corporate boards should pay more attention to the reported cash flow numbers. Regulators can reduce the opportunities available for cash flow misclassification by fixing relevant accounting and governance norms. Auditors can also help by critically focusing on the cash flow classifications presented by management. Originality/value: This study, to the authors' knowledge, is the first study that talks about the role of internal governance in a trade-off between different cash flow manipulation techniques.

This study aimed at identifying the effect of board size and board gender diversity on dividend payout and identifying the role of return on assets (ROA) in moderating the effect of size and board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study population consisted of (45) service shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), during the period (2009-2018), using balanced panel data of (36) service companies with (360) observations. The results indicate that the level of female representation in the boards of service companies in Jordan is still low compared to other countries. The results also showed that board size and board gender diversity affect dividend payout. In addition, the return on assets moderates the effect of board size on dividend payout. The results also showed that the return on assets does not moderate the effect of board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study recommends that regulatory bodies should take a step towards encouraging gender diversity in boards to enhance board of directors' effectiveness, through amending legislations that regulate female participation in boards, such as the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code.

This study explores the impact of legal protection level and board characteristics on the structure and the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. To reach the declared goals, this paper is supported by Mann-Whitney test. Data from 12 European countries for the 2016-2018 period reveals a significant impact of the legal protection level, CEO duality, board size, board independence and the presence of efficient compensation committee have a significant impact on the structure of CEO compensation but not on the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. In addition, the results show that the presence of women on board of directors has a positive impact on CEO's compensation. Present study contributes to literature in the fields of gender study and corporate governance of the firms. Also, present research has several managerial implications, highlighting the impact of legal protection and board characteristics on CEO compensation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: This cross-country study aims to investigate from an interdisciplinary perspective the impacts of the accounting regulation's strength and cultural values of long-term orientation (LTO) and indulgence (ND) on board efficacy in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: Board Efficacy Index scores for 54 developing countries over the period 2007-2016 were employed to ascertain predictors of management's accountability to boards of directors and investors. Two types of explanatory variables - formal and informal - were employed in a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis. Findings: The research is the first to empirically show that more LTO and ND in a country have significant and positive effects on board efficacy. The findings also show that the strength of auditing and reporting standards (SARS) has a dominant impact on board efficacy, and the SARS' consideration is recommended in future cross-country research on board efficacy. Practical implications: To restore investor confidence and increase the credibility toward firms, regulatory authorities in developing countries are called upon to integrate compliance with accounting and auditing regulations combined with cultural values in the implementation of good governance practices. Originality/value: This study contributes to the board efficacy literature in two significant ways. First, the study constructs and empirically tests a conceptual model that integrates both informal factors, the six cultural dimensions of Hofstede et al. (2010), and formal factors, the strength of accounting regulations. Second, conducting a study on a sample not widely used in the literature, over a fairly long period of time, highlights the governance characteristics of this context and strengthens the internal and external validity of the study.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Despite the increase in the number of studies analysing innovation in family firms over the last decade, there are still a number of critical issues that are far from being resolved. One of these issues is related to the influence of women's presence in corporate governance structures on firms' innovation outcomes. In light of this, the aim of the present chapter is to investigate whether the inclusion of women in private family firms' corporate governance structures, namely, in the general shareholders' meeting, the top management team and board of directors, influences firms' innovation. By applying regression analyses to a sample of 339 Spanish private family firms, the findings reveal that the presence of women in general shareholders' meetings and in top management teams has a negative and significant effect on innovation.

Purpose: This article examines the link between the structure of the board of directors and target price accuracy using a sample of 51 listed firms on the Tunisian Stock Exchange over the period of 2011-2017. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors used the generalised method of moments (GMM) model to control the endogeneity problem. Findings: As a result, that model can serve as a signal in the forecasting process. The authors' results suggest that target price accuracy is negatively related to board independence, and dual Chief Executive officer (CEO). In addition, CEO compensation tends to exert a negative impact on target price error. Practical implications: The authors' findings are valuable for common investors because the findings can be useful in enhancing their capital allocation decisions by assigning higher weights to forecasts issued by firms with strong corporate governance systems. The authors' study also has practical implications for managers and policymakers. Specifically, the evidence provided herein suggests that firms with strong corporate governance mechanisms enhance the accuracy of market expectations, alleviate information asymmetry, and limit market surprises, especially in a context characterised by weak investor protection. The authors' results highlight the advantages of strong corporate governance in improving a firm's information environment and, therefore, are useful for the cost-benefit analysis of improving internal governance mechanisms. Additionally, the authors' results may prove useful to investors who can rely on the information provided by analysts for well-governed companies. Social implications: The authors' study contributes to the literature in both corporate governance and analysts' forecasts fields. The study provides additional evidence of the benefit of board quality attributes on target price accuracy in an emerging market characterised by high information asymmetry and weak investor protection. The authors' findings exhibit the effectiveness of board attributes in producing better financial information quality in Tunisia. This is useful for investors who may improve their capital allocation decisions by assigning greater weights to target price forecasts of companies with good governance quality, suggesting that good corporate governance is a credible signal of better financial information quality. These results have important implications for capital market regulators and corporate management in encouraging the implementation of good governance practices. Originality/value: The authors attempted to assess whether corporate governance of listed firms are priced in the Tunisian context characterised by weak governance control and to highlight which mechanism is highly considered by independent financial analysts to build their forecasts.

This study aimed to examine the impact of board of directors effectiveness and ownership structure on reducing earnings management practices in the Jordanian manufacturing and service companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange during the period (2014-2017). Board of directors effectiveness was measured by: board independence, board size, multiple directorships and board meetings. On the other hand, ownership structure was measured by: institutional ownership, foreign ownership and government ownership. The dependent variable (earnings management)was measured based on the absolute value of discretionary accruals according to the modified Jones model. Four control variables were employed in the study (firm size, financial leverage, book to market ratio and type of audit firm). The sample of this study consists of (87) manufacturing and service companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange during the period (2014- 2017). Multiple regression analysis using Stata, version 14 was conducted to achieve the objectives of the study. The results showed a statistically significant negative relationship of foreign ownership, board independence and type of audit firm with earnings management. In light of these results, the study recommended to work on the development of laws and legislations that attract foreign investment, because it limits earnings manipulation by enhancing the concept of corporate governance, as well as the need of companies to comply with the corporate governance instructions, especially those associated with the independence of the board of directors because of its important role in reducing earnings management.

The study is conducted to investigate the impact of corporate governance and ownership on business performance in listed firms on the Vietnamese Stock Exchange. The study employed the general regression method (GLS) with a sample of 506 listed firms in the period 2008-2020. The study demonstrated the impacts of corporate governance and ownership on firm performance. First, the size of the Board of Directors (BOD), state ownership, and foreign ownership have a positive impact on firm performance. On the contrary, the ratio of independent members in the BOD and the percentage of members of the BOD who are major shareholders have a negative impact on firm performance. An interesting finding is that the BOD with female members, the duality of director and chairman, and the ratio of independent members have a negative impact on the Board of Management. In contrast, firms with no female members in the BOD have a positive relationship with firm performance. The empirical results and recommendations in this study might be good instructions for firms to improve their firm performance. (c) 2022 The author(s).

Employee share ownership offers the workforce an opportunity to participate in the growth of their company via two mechanisms: profit sharing and power sharing. Profit sharing has been widely studied in the academic literature. Power sharing, on the other hand, has received little attention--notably in the form of the presence of a director representing the interests of employees who own shares on governance bodies. We study 10 French companies with employee shareholder representation on governance bodies, and our findings reveal the dual nature of the role. On the one hand, the participation of employee shareholders in governance bodies seems to have an influence on the disciplinary, partnership, cognitive and behavioural levels. On the other hand, it can be a source of entrenchment, as tensions that are specific to this little-known mandate reflect tensions within the company itself.

Independent directors on a firm's board are theorized to enhance corporate governance by mitigating agency conflicts. However, some independent directors, referred to as grey directors, have prior relationships with managers that may hamper this role. Using data for Philippine firms, we construct a measure that categorizes independent directors as truly independent or grey, based on the 12 criteria used to define board independence as stipulated in the 2017 Philippine Corporate Governance Code. This measure is used to examine which firms are more likely to appoint grey directors and how the presence of grey directors affects firm performance. Consistent with agency theory, we find that firms with higher ownership concentration are more likely to have grey directors. However, we find that the presence of these grey directors does not adversely affect firm performance. We conclude that while grey directors are common among Philippine firms, their presence does not appear to escalate agency problems. (c) 2022 by De La Salle University.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In this article, we review recent archival research articles (98 studies) on the impact of corporate governance on restatements, enforcement activities and fraud as corporate financial misconduct. Applying an agency-theoretical view, we mainly differentiate between four levels of corporate governance (group, individual, firm, and institutional level). We find that financial restatements on the one hand and the group and individual level of corporate governance on the other hand are dominant in our literature review. Enforcement actions and fraud events as misconduct proxies, and the firm and institutional level of corporate governance are of lower relevance yet. The following review highlights that many studies on corporate governance find inconclusive results on firms' financial misconduct. But there are indications that board expertise and especially gender diversity in the top management decreases firms' financial misconduct. We know very little about the impact of non-shareholder stakeholders' monitoring role on misconduct yet. In discussing potential future research, we emphasize the need for a more detailed analysis of misconduct proxies, recognition of moderator and especially mediator variables, especially in the interplay of the board of directors and external auditors.

This paper examines whether gender diversity (GD) on corporate boards influences financial performance (FP) of Indian firms using System Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) methods by considering panel data of 364 firms during 2017 to 2021, comprising of 1820 firm-year observations. The study reveals that the mere presence of a woman director (WD) on boards makes no difference in financial performance. Presence of WDs as a significant portion of the boards and their active roles in the functioning and governance of companies positively contribute to firms' financial performances and economic value creation. Regarding other governance parameters, the study shows that larger boards do not necessarily improve firm performance. Also, independent directors do not necessarily add value to corporate performance and value creation. While a higher promoter's stake is an important factor for Indian companies to drive corporate performance, firms with separate CEO and chairperson outperform firms with CEO duality. The study also reveals that the covid 19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial performance and economic profit generation of the Indian firms. This study is important for several reasons. First, this study considers the period (2017-2021) when Indian companies adopted new financial reporting practices (IND-AS) in line with International Financial Reporting System (IFRS), the mandatory quota system of women directors' appointment is implemented and new corporate governance norms are implemented. Hence, our study contributes to the literature by proving meaningful insights on the role of gender diversity and other corporate governance parameters on financial performance of Indian firms in the light of newly adopted accounting and financial reporting practices. Second, few previous India based studies have mostly used pooled OLS or fixed effect models, and did not address the endogeneity problem in different forms like Dynamic Endogeneity, Simultaneity, and Unobserved Heterogeneity. This paper addresses the endogeneity problem appropriately by using the system generalized method of moments (GMM) while modelling the relation between WDs and firms' FP. Therefore, the findings of this study are more reliable and unbiased and can be useful for effective policy making on gender diversity and corporate governance issues. Third, few prior studies which have looked into the role of WDs on FP of Indian firms, have mostly used return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q as performance parameters. Here, in addition to ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we also use economic value added (EVA) as indicators of corporate performance to understand the role of WDs on economic value creation for companies. The EVA is considered as modern technique to measure the economic profit earned by a firm, and it has gained huge popularity among companies as an improved technique for measuring financial performance for companies. To the best of our knowledge, the role of WDs on economic value creation by firms has not been investigated before particularly in the Indian context. This is another unique contribution of this study. Fourth, the Covid 19 pandemic had impacted global economy severely and India was no exception. Financial performances of most Indian firms were negatively impacted due to the nationwide lockdown and uncertainties about production, revenue and earnings. This study considers both the pre and post Covid 19 pandemic period in examining our central research question using a year dummy. Therefore, our study also captures whether the covid 19 pandemic has actually impacted the financial performance of Indian firms, while modelling this relation. This is another valuable and unique contribution of this study to the literature. The findings of this study provide an understanding of how board gender diversity and other governance parameters influence financial performance of Indian firms in an emerging market context. The outcomes are also explained and aligned with the relevant policy implications in the light of recent Indian corporate governance norms and policies. These findings are useful to the companies and policymakers, as they can use these findings while designing effective boards, which can be useful in improving firm performance. Board of directors, investors, regulators, and policymakers can effectively use these findings to understand how gender diverse boards and other corporate governance parameters influence firms' financial performance under the concentrated ownership pattern.

Based on a sample of 4,089 multinational companies over the period 2015-2018, this study analyses the role that women leaders play in relation to the implementation of sustainability strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and whether this role depends on the proportion of female presence in management teams. The results show that the commitment to the 2030 Agenda is higher in companies with a woman as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or chairperson of the board of directors, as well as greater gender diversity in both, management teams and the monitoring body. However, the incongruity in the phenomenon of female leadership stereotypes hinders the existence of a complementary relationship that reinforces it. We showed that, consistent with the social role theory, prejudices act as barriers to achieve synergic effects among women in different management positions. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: This study aims to examine the influence of board gender diversity on dividend policy and cash holdings in several emerging economies. This study also investigates the nonlinear impact of women on dividend policy and cash holdings and the differences between countries with one- and two-tier board systems. Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes 103 firms listed in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. The data represent all industries except the financial industry. The sample period is the 10 financial years from 2010 to 2019. This study analyzed unbalanced panel data with fixed effect specifications for baseline model analysis. Findings: This study finds robust evidence indicating that women's presence negatively influences dividends and positively influences cash holdings. The findings in the additional analysis are significant and show a nonlinear relationship, supporting the substitution hypothesis. Practical implications: The findings of this paper certainly provided a valuable contribution as a useful empirical guide for policy decision-makers in developing countries, regulators and corporate decision-makers related to board gender diversity. Developed countries have implemented a minimum quota of women boards in the composition of the board of directors. However, there are still few developing countries that implement these policies. Women can reflect or show their values in corporate governance, such as being careful in making decisions and being conservative about risk. These guides policymakers in implementing a minimum quota of women in the composition of the board of directors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the debate on the impact of gender diversity on dividends and cash holdings, especially in ASEAN emerging economies because there is a notable empirical gap relative to developed countries. Moreover, this study contributes to the necessary nuanced understanding of the substitution hypothesis in emerging economies. The results also support the explanation of critical mass theory to account for the nonlinear relationship between the number of women board members and dividends and cash holdings.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, the typical bank in the Middle East lost liquidity due to deposit drains and experienced increases in nonperforming loans. The loss of liquidity was a supply shock, while the increase in nonperforming loans was a demand shock. Corporate governance increases the board's oversight of top management's implementation of strategies to reduce these shocks. Two corporate governance measures include a political concentration in the ownership and the presence of independent directors on the board of directors. Politically connected shareholders can ensure the continuous flow of deposits through their access to large depositors, thereby reducing supply shocks. Supply shocks may also be overcome by the large deposit balances from oil wealth. Independent directors are not employees of the banks on whose boards they serve, thereby providing objective evaluations of management's performance. Managers who are evaluated by independent directors can reduce nonperforming loans by strictly evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers and providing incentives for timely repayment. Thus, demand shocks may be overcome by the scrutiny of management by independent directors. These conditions prevail in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC countries). Using a sample of 326 GCC banks, we perform OLS regressions followed by two-stage least squares and GMM estimator robustness checks of ownership's political concentration, independent directors, bank size, and bank liquidity on returns on assets and equity. Ownership political concentration, independent directors, bank size, and liquidity ratio significantly explained the return on assets and on equity. We conclude that large shareholders use political connections to cope with crises and that large banks are able to make new loans due to liquidity from large reserves. Independent directors evaluate management performance objectively, thereby requiring that management reduce nonperforming loans. We close research gaps of bank performance in GCC countries, as opposed to the entire MENA region, the latter being the focus of the literature. The significance of this paper is that it demonstrates the ability of banks to employ corporate governance to cope with crises. This is an original approach, as it seeks the outcome of a positive signal on bank performance of the reduction in the supply shock through ownership political concentration and reduction in the demand shock by independent directors. As corporate governance variables mitigate both shocks, corporate governance may assist banks in coping with liquidity crises. (c) 2023 by the authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of corporate governance mechanisms, namely, board of directors and auditors, on tax aggressiveness in Italian companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a population of 168 Italian non-financial firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, holding shares in at least one foreign subsidiary in countries other than Italy in fiscal year 2018. Data on corporate boards and auditors were collected through the evaluation of companies' annual reports over the period 2011-2018. Five panel data analyses with fixed effects were performed for each tax aggressiveness index, yielding 1,176 observations to test the research hypothesis. Findings: This paper finds that corporate board characteristics, such as size, gender diversity and CEO duality, and auditors' features, such as external audit quality, increase corporate tax aggressiveness. Practical implications: This study provides investors with an understanding of corporate boards' and auditors' roles in preventing agency conflicts and evaluating a company's tax approach. Furthermore, the findings are useful for international political bodies in regulating corporate board composition and managerial monitoring. Originality/value: Almost all studies focusing primarily on corporate governance mechanisms' effects on tax aggressiveness are within the US context. Empirical evidence on the topic in the European contexts is limited. The legislative discrepancy between countries is reflected in the computation of indices measuring tax aggressiveness, affecting US studies' generalizability across nations. This paper extends the literature on the topic by investigating other unexplored corporate governance mechanisms. Five indices were used to measure corporate tax aggressiveness and to assess analysis reliability and data robustness. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the link between corporate governance mechanisms and tax aggressiveness in Italy.

From a business perspective, the health and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 have affected a firm's stakeholders to a different extent, making it necessary for them to develop sustainable initiatives that allow them to meet their needs. Decisions must be made and implemented in a recessionary environment in which companies debate whether it is economically reasonable to promote them and whether they can afford not to do so. In this work, based on the theory of social identity, we argue that these business commitments will have been promoted in companies with boards of directors that have a greater female presence. The results obtained for a sample of 4821 multinationals confirm that the repercussion of incidental affect on the social identity of the in-group of female directors has partially slowed the setback that business sustainability has suffered due to the pandemic, which is especially important with respect to good governance policies and practices and guaranteeing the social and environmental commitment of previous years. This evidence has important theoretical and practical implications, contributing the current debate on strategic decisions regarding sustainability and the benefits associated with board gender diversity.

This article investigates the relationship between political control and audit fees for local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in England--hybrid public service organizations not subject to public sector audit. Panel regression techniques are used to analyse secondary data on 405 SOEs for 2009-2017 where major local authorities held an interest. Statistical results suggest greater political representation on boards of directors of local SOEs is associated with higher audit fees and positive relationship between political control and audit fees is stronger for majority public ownership.

IMPACT: We need to know more about the financial accountability of corporatized public services. In this article, the authors analyse the audit fees of a large sample of English local SOEs from 2009-2017, assessing the impact of board composition and ownership structure on those fees. SOEs with more politicians on their boards of directors had higher audit costs and this was especially so for majority-owned SOEs. This article highlights the need for policy-makers to evaluate the consistency of auditing arrangements for the hybrid arm's-length organizations delivering public services.

Purpose: This study aims to provide an overview of the development of corporate governance and ownership structure literature and offers a synopsis of the top contributors, influential articles, journals and potential research prospects on this subject. Design/methodology/approach: This study used bibliometric analysis to review the literature. In all, 1,368 articles published between 1992 and 2022 in Scopus-indexed journals were considered. Findings: This review reveals the top leading authors, institutions, countries and sources in the ownership structure research. Using bibliographic coupling, this study fetches four significant clusters. The theme of the first cluster revolved around cash holding. The second and third groups revealed how distinct characteristics of ownership impact the performance of the firm and disclosure decisions, respectively. The last and fourth cluster deals with risk-taking activities in financial institutions. Furthermore, this study suggests a road map in each cluster for future research. Originality/value: Ownership structure plays a significant role in corporate governance by affecting manager incentives and determining the extent of monitoring. Previous studies have contributed to this field while focusing on the board of directors. However, no study synthesises the literature on ownership structure within corporate governance, which is the core element of the corporate governance system. Hence, this study gives a comprehensive overview and determines the latest and prominent research in ownership structure within corporate governance through bibliometric analysis.

Using a and a unique set of Italian non-listed Unlikely to Pay (UTP) positions, that consist in the phase that precedes the insolvency but where it is still possible for the company to succeed in restructuring, this paper aims to analyze the relationships between corporate governance characteristics and financial distress status. We compare the performance of corporate governance variables in predicting corporate defaults, using both the Logit and Random Forest models, which previous researchers have deemed to be the most efficient machine learning techniques. Our results show that the use of corporate governance variables - especially with regards to CEO renewal and stability in the composition of the board of directors - increases the accuracy of the Random Forest technique and influences the success of the turnaround process. This paper also confirms the Random Forest technique's ability to significantly outperform the Logit model in terms of accuracy. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

Purpose: In this paper, the impact of stock-based compensation and further the joint effects of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment on pension discount rate choice is examined. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses is tested using fixed effects models and instrumental variable analysis where pension discount rate is the dependent variable, and stock-based compensation and investor sentiment are our variables of interest. Findings: It was found that pension discount rate is negatively associated with managers' stock-based compensation. Further analysis indicates that managers with larger stock-based compensation tend to adjust down their pension discount rates in higher (smaller) degree, responding to high (low) investor sentiment. Practical implications: The findings provide important insights into how managers use pension discount rates to engage in earnings management. Understanding these relationships has implications for interpreting pension numbers reported in the financial statements and designing pension accounting rules that minimize the possibility that managers take advantage of the complexity associated with pension accounting to influence the reported earnings and executive compensation. Moreover, the findings suggest the need for increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to reported pension liabilities and service costs, especially for firms paying higher proportion of stock-based compensation to managers and during periods of high investor sentiment. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the extant literature by identifying the joint impacts of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment as incentives for pension discount rate manipulation. The empirical results of this study also have important implications for corporate governance and regulation. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim of this study was to examine the moderating effect of ownership concentration (OC) on the relationship between impactful female directors and earnings management (EM). The study concentrated on firms with the lowest positive earnings, measured by return on assets. The results showed that OC positively moderated the association between impactful female directors and accrual earnings management (AEM). With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became positively associated with AEM. In terms of real earnings management (REM), the results showed that OC weakened the significant negative relationship between impactful female directors and REM that was found in the direct regression. With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became insignificantly associated with REM. The study is extremely beneficial to policymakers, stakeholders, researchers, and society. It provides empirical findings that could help all parties to re-evaluate the role of the board of directors, specifically impactful female directors, in mitigating EM. The results highlight the impact of the majority shareholders, introduced by agency theory II, an issue that requires more solutions from regulators. (c) 2023 by the author.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine to which extent ownership and board structure improve financial institutions' credit ratings. Design/methodology/approach: Ordered Probit regression models were used to examine the association between corporate governance attributes and banks' credit ratings. The sample consists of 97 publicly traded financial institutions on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock exchange markets and cover the period 2010-2019. All GCC countries were considered in this study which are United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar. Findings: The results show that banks' credit ratings are positively associated with the size of the board of directors and with the number of female directors serving in the board of directors. And it is negatively associated with the frequency of board meetings. Furthermore, this study finds evidence that nonbank financial institutions' credit ratings are positively associated with CEO duality and with frequency of board meetings. Also, this study shows that their credit ratings are negatively associated with the ownership percentage held by the major five shareholders and with the number of board members serving in the board of directors. Originality/value: Unlike previous research, this study focuses on the effect of the role of two different corporate governance dimensions, namely, ownership and board structure on the rating of financial institutions. This paper contributes to the extant literature in various ways. It bridges the gap of this topic in the GCC region. And, unlike previous research, this study focused on the financial sector and divided the sample into banks and other financial institutions to examine both subsamples separately. Also, this study introduced new ownership and board structure variables for the purpose of investigating the impact of corporate governance on financial institutions' credit ratings such as the presence of women in the board of directors.

Purpose: This paper examines the capital structure decisions of family firms in Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, considering the moderating effects of various firm-level and country-level factors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply various panel data models to analyze the data of listed firms in six ASEAN countries over the period of 2007-2017. Findings: The authors find that family firms tend to use more debt, particularly short-term debt, than non-family firms, which is explained by family owners' concern about the risk of losing control. The authors further document that family firms would use more debt when they have lower ownership concentration, have more family members on the board of directors and are young firms. The authors also find that the impact of family ownership on capital structure is moderated by the level of investors' legal protection of a country. Originality/value: This study, for the first time, provides comprehensive analyses of the financing decisions of family firms in ASEAN using a unique hand-collected dataset, which highlights that regional culture and market conditions can shape family firms' financing decisions. The authors also manage to mitigate the endogeneity issues that pervade most research on family firms. In addition, this research further explores the heterogeneous impacts of family control on capital structure given different levels of board involvement, firm age, ownership concentration, and most importantly, institutional differences. Such insights provide useful information for prospective investors as well as regulators to make more efficient investment and legislative decisions. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

From an agency perspective, the Anglo-Saxon features of corporate governance are predominantly explored by various studies in extant literature. However, it has recently been established that diverse and unique institutional configurations exist in different economies across the world and hence, the attitude of different actors within a firm, as shaped by institutional logics, can vary. Our study applies the institutionalized agency perspective to understand how the behaviour of different actors, within firms in the Indian institutional context, are shaped, consequently determining their roles in the strategic decisions of firms. We examine the representation of lenders in the board of directors, which is a characteristic of corporate governance in India. Our sample for this study consists of 985 unique Indian firms and 5513 firm year observations across the 2006-2017 time-period. We find a negative association between the proportion of lender representatives on board of directors and internationalization of firms. In addition, we also find that family ownership positively moderates this relation, whereas foreign institutional investors and domestic banks and financial institutional investors moderate this relationship negatively. In this manner, we explore the impact of institutional environment on a very specific actor (lenders) and their representatives towards internationalization. (c) 2021, The Author(s).

We study the impact of gender diversity in corporate boards on firm value by exploiting a natural experiment setting in India where the government mandated firms to appoint at least one female director on their boards. We find a significantly positive market reaction when firms comply with the mandate but only when they appoint qualified female directors who are not related to promoters. Moreover, market reward is higher for firms headquartered in states with severe gender bias. We show how regulatory intervention mitigates frictions related to gender bias to improve firm value through greater gender diversity when firms respond appropriately. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This chapter presents a basic level explanation about corporate debt and its viability. Also, it presents basic corporate governance types and their relationship with corporate debt and its manifestations worldwide. It is an indisputable fact that corporate governance is increasingly appearing on the world stage. How listed companies are controlled and managed has begun to concern the firm environment in its totality, such as the Board of Directors, senior executives, shareholders, employees and those who present a relative interest in that company. After the pressure of the collapse of many large companies, the supervisory authorities of almost all economies began to look for systems to deal with and solve the problems of protecting shareholders and creditors of stock exchange-listed companies. The main objective of corporate governance systems is the fully transparent and effective management of a company, which will maximize its financial value and protect shareholders and creditors. A large part of corporate governance concerns the financial viability of businesses, and that is where loans and corporate debts, in general, come in. Corporate debts in the modern economy have skyrocketed and are now determining the economic scene worldwide. (c) 2023 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study analyzed the impact of the interplay between fee-oriented strategies and ownership structure on analyst forecast accuracy using a sample of international publicly-listed hospitality firms. Based on 29,019 earnings forecasts made by financial analysts, using Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS), entropy balancing, and Heckman two-stage models, we documented that, on average, forecasts were more accurate for firms pursuing a fee-oriented strategy. Moreover, the positive effect of fee-oriented strategies on forecast accuracy was stronger for companies with concentrated ownership. We explain our results by the fact that fee-oriented firms enjoyed more stable cash flows and revenue, reducing information asymmetries between a firm's outsiders and insiders, thus enabling analysts to make more accurate forecasts. This effect was more important for firms with concentrated ownership in particular, as they generally disclosed less information to the capital markets. Our findings should be of great interest to hospitality firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to explore the long-run impact of board governance and bank performance on executive remuneration. More specifically, the study addresses two objectives. First, the authors investigate the long-run relationship between pay and performance hold for the Indian banking industry. Second, the authors explore the moderating role of the board in explaining the relationship between executive pay and performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses multivariate panel co-integration approaches, i.e. fully modified and dynamic ordinary least square, to explain the co-integrating relationship between executive pay, governance and performance of Indian banks. The analysis is conducted for the period from 2005 to 2018. Findings: The results of co-integration tests reveal a long-run relationship between executive pay, board governance and bank performance. The long-run estimates produce evidence in favour of the dynamic agency theory, suggesting that the implications of asymmetric information can be mitigated by associating the current executive pay with the bank performance in the previous periods. The finding of this study reveals that improvements in the board quality serve as a monitoring tool to constrain excessive pay and moderate the executives' pay. Furthermore, the interaction of performance and board governance negatively impacts pay, supporting a substitution approach. It implies that setting optimal pay packages for executives necessitates enhanced and efficient board governance practices. Practical implications: The study recommends significant policy implications for regulators and the board of directors that executive pay significantly responds to the bank's performance and good board governance practices in the long run. Originality/value: This paper provides novel evidence of long-run pay-performance-governance relation using a panel co-integration approach. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

SOX requires that the audit of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) is "integrated" with the audit of the financial reports, which means the same audit firm conducts these two audits. Prior studies found that audit costs and quality were lower for non-integrated audits in the Chinese context (Gunn et al. in Account Rev, 2021). This paper reports the association between firms' internal corporate governance mechanisms and the decision between integrated and non-integrated audits in Chinese companies. The empirical results demonstrate that firms with a larger proportion of controlling owners or those in which the same person is the BOD chairman and CEO, or those that are state-owned or have a smaller proportion of independent directors, are more likely to choose non-integrated audits than integrated audits. Our study implies that firms with weak internal corporate governance mechanisms choose non-integrated audits or switch to non-integrated ones if integrated audits are not mandatory. Our conclusions provided evidence that helps regulators understand the consequence of the regulation enforcement on public companies with different corporate governance models if these regulation compliance options are available.

The present work aimed to shed light on the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on real earnings management (REM) as well as the moderating role of auditor reputation in the association between BGD and REM using panel data of 1162 French non-financial firm-year observations from the SBF120 index during the period 2005-2019. Our findings show that BGD is negatively related to REM. Furthermore, we found that this relationship is more prominent in firms with higher auditor reputation mainly because highly reputable auditors aim to preserve their image and are more likely to detect earnings management activities.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

The main objective of this article is to study the impact of a scandal with the Vice Chairman of the Founding Board - VCFB (former member of the Board of Directors - BoD) and the former General Manager of Asia Commercial Bank (ACB) on the daily returns of shares of 9 sectors of the Vietnam's stock market. The event study method is used for each industry with many different event windows. Research results show that the announcement of an arrest warrant is an entirely unexpected event for the stock market because no industry reacts significantly in the days before the event. The reaction of industries was strongest 5 days after the event for the Banking and Finance industries and 2 days after the event for non-financial industries. The conclusion of the study shows that although the information is directly related to one bank - ACB, its spillover effects have covered all nine industries including the financial and non-financial industries on the Vietnam stock market (VST). The nature of cross-ownership among commercial banks in Vietnam (CB Vietnam) explains that negative information only creates a spillover effect within the industry but does not have a competitive effect in this industry. Social networks amplify herd mentality and spillover effects, negatively impacting the financial and non-financial industries in the stock market. (c) Phuong L. C.M., 2023.

This paper empirically analyzes the impact that director blockholders have on earnings management. We argue that having a blockholder serve on the board of directors will improve a firm's corporate governance due to having both the ability and incentive to correct problems in a firm. We provide evidence that the presence of blockholders on the board of directors lowers the amount of abnormal working capital accruals caused by CEO incentives. We show that this is primarily done by reducing abnormal increases in inventory. This finding is most robust among busy boards, providing evidence that director blockholders can provide strong corporate governance in the absence of an attentive board of directors. Our findings suggest that director blockholders can provide an important role for firms and may prevent managers from taking value-destroying actions. (c) 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: This study examines the association between internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board of directors and audit committee) and the information value of bank earnings. The authors comparatively assess this association across different bank types, Islamic versus conventional banks. The authors also investigate the mediating effect of Shariah governance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize a unique and an international sample of 723 bank-year observations representing 100 listed banks from 16 countries during the period 2007-2015. The authors investigate the characteristics of the board of directors and audit committee (i.e. size and independence) and employ three core analyses for earnings informativeness (i.e. earnings persistence, cash flow predictability and reliability of loan loss provisions). Additional analyses address Shariah supervisory boards' (SSBs') size, financial expertise and multiple outside directorships. The authors use the random-effect Generalised Least Squares (GLS) estimation technique and provide several robustness checks and sensitivities. Findings: The authors find that, on average, having large and independent boards (and audit committees) increases the informativeness of reported earnings for banks. Conditional on bank type, our results report strong evidence for differential effects across the two alternative banking systems. In Islamic banks, large and independent board of directors (and audit committees) is positively associated with all measures of information value. There is insignificant evidence for conventional banks. However, SSBs show no significant effect on the reported earnings' informativeness. Originality/value: This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, that empirically and comparatively assesses the information value of reported earnings in association with effective internal governance while recognizing the institutional characteristics of different bank types. The authors offer new insights to policymakers, investors and other stakeholders located within countries operating on a dual banking system. The results could help regulators to improve their rules/guidance related to double-layer governance and financial reporting quality. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate is an artificial legal person whose hands, eyes, ears are supposed to be the governing board! Yes, the board of directors of a company. It is also very specifically expected that the said 'board' is impartial and fairly dealing with the state of the affairs of the business to discharge its fiduciary duty, i.e., custodian of somebody's trust. But it is very strange that at times inappropriate, all of sudden, it comes to the fore, that the so and so company is yet another victim of fraudulent practices, resulting in its debacle. Straightforwardly, the fraudulent failure of the joint stock limited liability corporate is a direct question mark on the intention of its governing board! In this paper an alarm has been raised to highlight the legitimate aspiration of all those, who are betrayed by such failures! Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Debt holders monitoring influence on the business performance has been noted in several research. Another body of research investigates the board of directors and performance linkages. The impact of debtholders on the board composition and firm performance linkage, particularly in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), has received little attention in the literature. As a result, this article aims to determine whether the composition of Indian SOE boards has an impact on their performance. It also looks into how leverage influences the association between the composition of Indian SOE boards and their performance. From 2001 to 2019, the panel data regression is performed on 19 Indian SOEs registered on the Bombay Stock Exchange. According to the study, board size, nominee directors improve Indian SOE performance, while independent directors reduce performance. Furthermore, in high-leverage SOEs, board of directors' supervision is reduced or removed. The findings have implications for policymakers and the government. (c) 2023 K.J.

This study aimed to demonstrate the impact of corporate governance principles on financial performance in Jordanian family companies. The study population consisted of industrial companies listed in the Amman Stock Exchange during the period (2014-2018). Corporate governance was measured by: (the size of the company's board of directors, the separation of the positions of the chairman and the CEO, the independence of the board members and the percentage of ownership of major shareholders), while the financial performance was measured using financial ratios (profitability and liquidity) and the size of the company and leverage were used as adjusting variables. The study sample consisted of (34) family-owned industrial companies listed in the Amman Stock Exchange out of (51) companies with a percentage of (66.6%) of the total number of industrial companies. The method of multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable, in addition to measuring the degree of interpretation of the independent variables of the variation in the dependent variable. The results of the study showed that there is a statistically significant impact of the implementation of family-business governance (the size of the board of directors, the separation of the positions of the chairman and the CEO, the independence of the members of the board of directors and the percentage of ownership of major shareholders) on the profitability ratio and the liquidity ratio being among the dimensions of financial performance. Corporate-governance variables in the study indicated that 81.4% of family businesses in Jordan apply corporate-governance principles and there was a statistically significant effect of the adjusting variables (company size and leverage) on the profitability and liquidity ratio in family businesses. The study recommended the importance of applying the principles of corporate governance in family companies that have not fully implemented the principles of governance, because of their positive and significant role in enhancing their financial performance.

Purpose: Firm performance has become a thriving research field. However, a review of previous studies shows that the answers to several fundamental questions remain vague and require further investigation. Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to determine the extent of the involvement of political connections (PCs) in Pakistani-listed companies, and the second is to examine the association between PCs and firm financial performance with director efficacy's moderating role. Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008-2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm's financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study's findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company's best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy.

Many criteria encompass the concept of corporate governance. There is an apprehension that it's the non-retail investors who would be interested in such governance of firms rather than retail investors, as they hold a small fraction of ownership, usually being passive investors and not in a capacity to influence the management. This study is an attempt to understand the attitude and perception of retail investors in India toward corporate governance practices and for that purpose, a questionnaire was served to consist of a range of corporate governance factors. The data was studied through percentage analysis and chi-square was run. It was established, that retail investors pay attention to corporate governance factors, more importantly to the board of directors, this finding supports the results of Chakraborty et al. (2023). But there is no strong course of action that they prefer to resolve any of their governance-related issues. India, where promoter groups are dominant, has a long way to go to bring out shareholder activism at par with developed markets. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016-2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: We approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Research Findings/Insights: We show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state-owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state-owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.

This study examines the link between the political connections and financial performance of companies in Brazil and Canada, taking into account the moderating role of their country institutional factors. The authors use a comparative analysis of the largest listed companies in the two countries between 2010 and 2017 inclusive. There were four main results: (a) no significant difference was noted in the number of politically connected firms, although Brazilian companies were more politically connected on average than Canadian companies; a significant difference was noted between Brazil and Canada in terms of the number of politically connected directors and executive officers; (b) a significant and positive link emerged in both countries between political connections and firm performance, as measured by ROIC and ROA; (c) distinguishing between the political connections of directors and those of officers, a more significant positive association with performance was noticed in the latter; (d) most important, a clear and significant moderating role played by their country institutional factors was not apparent in the relationship between firms' political connections and performance. These latter results are mainly due to the lack of significant difference between the two countries in the number of politically connected firms. Contrary to expectations (and those of previous studies examining multicountry samples), the same effects from corporate political connections were shown in both countries. The study makes two important contributions. First, political connections seem to have become stronger than governance and institutional mechanisms, when it comes to controlling the behaviour of big corporations. Political connections have become so important that they influence the firm's management structure, whatever the institutional context; they seem to transcend governance mechanisms. Second, this study is among the first to demonstrate the need for investigating political connections at different firm levels; it shows the specific effect of political connections through executive officers rather than only through boards of directors, as is usually done.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This study investigates the relationship between former chief executive officer (CEO) directors and audit pricing. We find that the former CEO directors negatively impact the company's audit fees. The results do not change after conducting a series of robustness tests. Former CEO directors reduce the company's operating risk, improve the company's earnings quality, and reduce the company's audit fees. Meanwhile, they are more effective at monitoring in companies with less analyst following, lower proportion of female directors, and non-family firms, thus reducing audit fees. Further evidence shows that larger auditors are more likely to reduce audit fees for their clients that have former CEOs retained on the board of directors. (c) 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
