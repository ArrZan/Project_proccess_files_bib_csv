This paper explores how motivating an incumbent CEO to undertake actions that improve the effectiveness of his management interacts with the firm's policy on CEO replacement. Such policy depends on the presence and the size of severance pay in the CEO's compensation package and on the CEO's influence on the board of directors regarding his own replacement (i.e., entrenchment). We explain when and why the combination of some degree of entrenchment and a sizeable severance package is desirable. The analysis offers predictions about the correlation between entrenchment, severance pay, and incentive compensation.

This essay surveys research about the value of individual members of boards of directors. When directors join or exit corporate boards, company stock prices respond, often in magnitudes of 1% of firm value or more. Related research shows that when a significant event impacts the stock price of one company, the effects are transmitted to other companies that share board members in common with the primary company. Share price reactions are sensitive to variables such as a director's occupation, independence, and professional qualifications. Together, this evidence suggests that a well-functioning market for directors might already exist, making direct regulation unnecessary and possibly counter-productive.

In this paper we tested the relationship between the IRR and the corporate governance choices of 87 Italian closed-end funds for the management of 698 private equity operations carried out from 1999 to 2003. In particular, we looked for information about the role of independent directors and their ability to stimulate firm growth and the closed-end funds final return, compared with the performance of dependent directors. We found no differences in the performance of venture-backed firms due to the presence of independent members in the board of directors, and concluded that this does not influence final results.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

We document changes in board characteristics in public US firms between 1997 and 2003. We find significant changes in board independence, committee independence, board size, interlocking directorships, director occupation and multiple directorships. Most of the changes occur between 2000 and 2003. In general, these changes appear both in small and large firms. However, changes in board size and in multiple directorships are statistically significant in large firms only. We find weaker trends in the financial stake of independent directors and in separating CEOs from the chairman position. In 2003 many independent directors have small holdings in the firms they direct and CEOs chair around two-thirds of the boards in our sample. Together, these results shed light on the types of board structures that have recently become the norm in US public firms. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Conventional wisdom suggests that giving monitored agents an oversight role may blunt the effectiveness of the monitoring process. In contrast, I show that less independent boards can sometimes be more effective at monitoring. Fully independent boards have incentives to shirk monitoring ex post, after the agents' productive inputs are sunk, if the boards cannot commit ex ante to monitoring. However, boards with inside directors may have incentives to monitor the agents ex post. The demand for insiders thus arises endogenously as they allow boards to indirectly commit to monitoring and thereby facilitate the monitoring process. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article presents a model of optimal control of corporate boards of directors. We determine when one would expect inside versus outside directors to control the board, when the controlling party will delegate decision-making to the other party, the extent of communication between the parties, and the number of outside directors. We show that shareholders can sometimes be better off with an insider-controlled board. We derive endogenous relationships among profits, board control, and the number of outside directors that call into question the usual interpretation of some documented empirical regularities.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper analyzes how board independence affects the CEO's ability to extract rents from the firm. The CEO is assumed to possess private information about his ability, which the board needs in order to decide whether to replace him. If the board is more active in removing low quality CEOs, the incumbent is better able to use his information advantage to extract rents. Since the board cannot commit not to renegotiate the contract, a board that is fully independent from the CEO is more active than is efficient ex ante. For this reason, shareholders are better off if the board of directors lacks some independence. The model predicts that a trend toward greater board independence is associated with subsequent trends toward higher CEO turnover, more generous severance packages, and larger stock option grants.

In light of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the effectiveness of good governance in Asian economies has been a confronting issue. This situation raised the key issue in corporate governance of how to effectively monitor managers and to exercise control so that managers act in the best interest of the shareholders. Amongst others, the existence of a board of directors is an important system for shareholding monitoring and control. This research empirically examines the relationship between board size, percentage of executives and performance of property companies listed in Malaysia. The findings provide evidence that the market seems to have a preference for small boards, but with more executive directors. (c) 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

Purpose - Although board expertise has been identified as an important determinant of board performance, some surveys are still reporting that the overall level of board expertise is insufficient to carry out current and emerging roles. Consequently, companies must ensure that board members have the required skills and knowledge. This study aims to examine three board processes aimed at developing and improving board expertise. Design/methodology/approach - Based on disclosures in the corporate governance guidelines of 100 leading US companies, the study focuses on three board processes, i.e. director nominations, orientation and education programs, and board performance evaluations. Findings - Based on the initial findings, it is found that most companies in the sample were in compliance with stock exchange requirements and provided information on director nominations, orientation and education programs and board performance evaluations. All too often, however, the companies disclosed generic, non-specific information; this provides little reassurance that the proper processes are in place to promote companies' long-term interests. Research limitations/implications - By examining these key board processes, the paper contributes to the governance literature by providing empirical evidence on this important topic and offering guidance to companies examining board processes aimed at improving directors' overall expertise. Originality/value - By focusing on disclosures in corporate governance guidelines, the authors also gain insight into decisions made by companies under increased pressure from securities regulators and other stakeholders to provide increased transparency on governance issues.

This study examines the relevance of bank board structure on bank risk-taking. Using a sample of 212 large US bank holding companies over 1997-2004 (1534 observations), this study finds that strong bank boards (boards reflecting more of bank shareholders interest) particularly small and less restrictive boards positively affect bank risk-taking. In contrast, CEO power (CEO's ability to control board decision) negatively affects bank risk-taking. These results are consistent with the bank contracting environment and robust to several proxies for bank risk-takings and different estimation techniques. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

We analyze the board of directors' equilibrium strategies for setting CEO incentive pay and overseeing financial reporting and their effects on the level of earnings management. We show that an increase in CEO equity incentives does not necessarily increase earnings management because directors adjust their oversight effort in response to a change in CEO incentives. If the board's responsibilities for setting CEO pay and monitoring are separated through the formation of committees, then the compensation committee will increase the use of stock-based CEO pay, as the increased cost of oversight is borne by the audit committee. Our model generates predictions relating the board committee structure to the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation, the quality of board oversight, and the level of earnings management.

This study examines whether a firm's corporate governance system, particularly with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors and senior management, affects how accurately the impact of accounting changes is reported to shareholders. We concentrate on the relation between corporate governance measures and accounting forecast errors that arise with adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards by listed Australian firms. Evidence reveals that corporate governance mechanisms are associated with the likelihood and magnitude of managerial forecast errors. (c) 2008 Accounting Foundation.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

Using a corporate governance scorecard (Corp-Gov Score) measuring twenty-six areas of corporate governance best practices in four UK banks, this study examined whether improved levels of corporate governance led to higher levels of firm performance within the UK banking industry over the time period 1999-2006. The twenty-six measures were split into four sub-sector areas of Corp-Gov Score comprising Board of Directors, Remuneration Policies, Auditing Policies, and Transparency/Disclosure Policies. Using both correlation and regression analysis on the information extracted from the Annual Reports, the study provides evidence about the extent to which UK banks have complied with recent corporate governance reforms post Enron. The results indicate that improvements in corporate governance can enhance the performance of UK banks when measuring using Return on Equity. The biggest sub-sector driver of this improvement is in the area of the Board of Directors. Our results further indicate that large boards within UK banks can have a negative impact on firm performance, and that increases in directors' remuneration does not lead to increased levels of firm performance. Evidence is given that corporate governance within UK banks plays an important role, but how it affects firm performance is open to debate.

The financial crisis in the UK began in late 2008 and the consequential economic recession has brought to the attention of media, commentators, policy makers and academics the importance of corporate gov-ernance. This research explores UK governance, what it means, what are its influences and how it is changing at the time of this financial crisis. The researchers conducted a series of qualitative interviews in five UK companies across a spectrum of industries (including institutional investors) in late 2008. Three key propositions were investigated: Proposition 1 is that board characteristics, the importance of which are pronounced by agency theorists are not the only key factor in "best practice" governance. Pro-position 2 is that shareholders and stakeholder involvement in governance will improve governance practices. Proposition three is that key to understanding governance failures is examining cognition and behaviours inside the black box of decision-making. Propositions two and three were supported by the interviews. The main conclusions are that the importance of good governance in establishing trust again at the time of the financial crisis is key and changes seem to be called for in a number of areas: in en-hancing shareholder voice; better disclosure in explaining variations to the application of the principles of the Combined Code, in explaining risks, and in how decisions are made; and ensuring that executive remuneration is more clearly linked to profits, costs of capital and risk and reflects long-term value creation.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

The presence of women on boards of directors has become a high profile issue in recent years. Several studies, based largely on data from countries with Anglo-Saxon corporate governance systems, have investigated the influence of female board appointments on firm performance. This study focuses on the impact of female directors in Spain, where debate about this topic has been intense for two reasons: the recommendation in 2006 by Spain's Unified Good Governance Code of positive discrimination in favour of female board appointments and the passing in 2007 of a Gender Equality Act by the Spanish parliament. Our paper analyses the short and long term effect of the appointment of female directors prior to these events. We use an event study to analyze the short term stock market reaction to the appointment of female directors and a multiple regression approach, using the system GMM estimation procedure, to assess the long term influence on firm value of female boardroom appointments. We find that the stock market reacts positively in the short term to the announcement of female board appointments, suggesting that investors on average believe that female directors add value. This belief appears to be confirmed by our regression results which show that female board appointments are positively associated with firm value over a sustained period. These results suggest that the legislative changes in Spain make economic sense as well as advancing the cause of women in Spanish boardrooms. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

We examine the relation between audit committee compensation and the demand for monitoring of the financial reporting process. We find that total compensation and cash retainers paid to audit committees are positively correlated with audit fees and the impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our proxies for the demand for monitoring. Our results are robust to the inclusion of audit committee quality, measured as the committee chair financial expertise. Our results suggest a recent willingness by firms to deviate from the historically prevalent one-size-fits-all approach to director pay in response to increased demands on audit committees and differential director expertise.

This paper examines the trends and endogenous determinants of boards of directors (board size, composition, and CEO duality) for a sample of 212 US bank holding companies, from 1997 to 2004. Overall, the results show that the costs and benefits of boards' monitoring and advising roles could explain bank board structures with caveats. For example, due to the regulatory nature and comparatively intensive scrutiny of bank officers and directors, it is argued that bank managers have less control over the directors' selection processes. Thus, bank board independence should not be the outcome of negotiation with CEOs. Consistent with this view, bank CEOs are found not to affect bank board independence. The trend analysis also provides some important results. In contrast to non-bank evidence, for instance, board size was discovered to decrease over the sample period for large and medium-sized banks, while board size remained relatively stable for small banks. These results are robust with respect to different estimation specifications. Furthermore, the study's findings have important policy implications for bank regulators and investors.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the establishment of a risk management committee and board structures of Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee. These findings suggest that stronger boards demonstrate their commitment to and awareness of improved internal control environment. Finally, the study also documents a positive and significant association between firm size, complexity of a firm's operations, and the use of Big Four audit firms with the establishment of a risk management committee.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The specific monitoring effect of boards of directors versus industry regulation is unclear. In this paper, we examine how the interaction between bank-level monitoring and regulatory regimes influences the announcement period returns of acquiring banks in the US and twelve European economies. Research Findings/Insights: We study three board monitoring mechanisms - independence, CEO-chair duality, and diversity - and analyze their effectiveness in preventing underperforming merger strategies under bank regulators of varying strictness. Only under strict banking regulation regimes, do board independence and diversity improve acquisition performance. In less strict regulatory environments, corporate governance is virtually irrelevant in improving the performance outcomes of merger activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate a complementary role between monitoring by boards and bank regulation. This study is the first to report evidence consistent with complementarity by investigating the effectiveness (rather than the prevalence) of governance arrangements across regulatory regimes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our work offers insights to policymakers charged with improving the quality of decision-making at financial institutions. Attempts to improve the ability of bank boards to critically assess managerial initiatives are most likely to be successful if internal governance is accompanied by strict industry regulation.

The board of directors is a flat governance structure where each director has an equal vote in determining the collective actions taken by the group. Yet, some boards choose to delegate authority for specific tasks to numerous committees, while others choose to create relatively few subcommittees of the board. We investigate the determinants of subordinate board structures, exploring both their benefits and costs. Using a sample of the S&P 1500 we find that subordinate board structures are positively related to board size and the proportion of outside directors, even after controlling firm characteristics such as complexity and ownership structure. Further tests indicate that these board structures can offset the negative associations that board size and the proportion of outsiders can have with firm performance. Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, where co-ordination problems among directors or social loafing may be less pronounced, we find that subordinate board structures are negatively related to firm performance. Categorizing committees as either monitoring or advisory, we find that both types of committees appear related to firm performance. Taken as whole, these results are consistent with the idea that subordinate board structures can be a costly remedy to alleviate problems that arise with larger, more outsider dominated boards.

Using a proprietary database for the largest 158 European companies during 1999-2004, I find that transparency of executive pay disclosures and sensitivity of executive pay to performance increase with the proportion of top executives serving as company directors and with dual chief executive officer (CEO) and board chairs. These relations strengthen in countries with more protection for outside shareholders. The positive marginal effects of executive directors (i.e., insiders) on transparency of pay disclosures and sensitivity of pay to performance are not significant when (1) insiders already have the numerical majority on boards, (2) CEOs are board chairs, and (3) pay levels and company ownership of executives are relatively high. Overall, the evidence supports the optimal-contracting argument over the rent-seeking argument. Specifically, companies mitigate agency costs associated with the existence of company executives on boards through transparent pay disclosures and incentive compensation. However, such actions are limited to companies with strong country-level investor protection and significant representation of independent directors on company boards.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a model to assess the effectiveness and compliance of bank boards, taking into account their unique characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on the roles and effectiveness of boards and directors in the financial industry is reviewed. Findings - The main finding in the literature suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of a board must include characteristics of the entire board as well as individual contributions of directors. Practical implications - Banking boards, more than in the past, must proactively evaluate their effectiveness and compliance with existing rules. Originality/value - The paper proposes a model for assessing the effectiveness and compliance of boards and directors of banking organizations, considering their characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations.

Using a large sample of European listed Companies and their Directors our study supports the hypothesis that European corporate governance do not yet converging towards a common model. Our results put in evidence in fact the existence of three dominant corporate governance profiles in European listed companies, different each others. The determinants of these profiles depend on the typical governance system adopted by the same companies and on country's culture and history; as a consequence, each of them has a own attitude of the board, in terms of structure, organization and skill mix characteristics. Finally we suggest some important implications on European governance practices.

This paper discusses the degree to which codes of corporate governance and the guidelines that develop around them tend to shift the locus of control away from the board of directors. It is argued that even in principles-based codes of governance such outcomes are an unavoidable consequence and that policy makers should weigh such consequences carefully before promulgating codes and guidelines. The case of the treatment of footprints (incentive plan performance averaging periods) by the UK's Association of British Insurers (ABI) is analysed to illustrate the problem.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the educational qualifications and experience of executive and non-executive members of directorial boards in Australia. Inspired by Galbraith's (1967) analysis of the 'technostructure', we examine the educational qualifications of managerial (executive) directors and non-executive directors to assess the extent of divergences in the relevance (to the company's operations) of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications. In addition, we measure the 'relatedness' of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications to determine the extent to which the set of educational qualifications of executive directors diverges from that of non-executive directors. We find significant differences in the relevance of the educational qualifications possessed by executives and non-executives. We also find very low relatedness between the two sets of educational qualifications. The advantages of board diversity on the one hand and the disadvantages that may attend potentially sub-optimal technical information flow on the other are discussed.

The aim of this paper is to explain the particular characteristics of the corporate governance of banks and its role for good bank performance. In order to do that, it reviews the existing literature on this issue trying to answer three main questions: (i) Why are banks different? Existing research points at diverse features, such as, regulation, supervision, capital structure, risk, fiduciary relationships, ownership, and deposit insurance, that would make banks special and thereby influence their corporate governance. (ii) What is different about bank governance? According to past studies, banks' boards of directors are larger, more independent, have a superior number of committees and meet more often, but seem to play a weaker disciplinary role. Executive compensation would be higher in banking, but pay-performance sensitivity appears lower. (iii) What works for banks? Larger boards, more concentrated ownership structures and certain levels of managerial shareholdings are the principal factors suggested by the empirical evidence to date that seem to lead banks to higher performance.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This paper examines the role of women helping women in corporate America. Using a merged panel of directors and executives for large US corporations between 1997 and 2009, we find a positive association between the female share of the board of directors in the previous year and the female share among current top executives. The relationship(r) timing suggests that causality runs from boards to managers and not the reverse. This pattern of women helping women at the highest levels of firm leadership highlights the continued importance of a demand-side "glass ceiling" in explaining the slowprogress of women in business.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether the qualitative dimension of the ownership structure, in particular the family identity of the controlling shareholder, infl uences the optimal configuration of the Board of Directors, as well as the effect that such configuration has on firm value creation. The econometric technique used, the system estimator of the Generalized Method of Moments, applied to a panel of Spanish family and non-family listed companies in the period 2001-2007, allows us to solve the traditional problem of endogeneity existing in studies of corporate governance. The results show how the need for advising and monitoring depends on the family nature of the controlling shareholder and, therefore, the optimal structure of the Board of Directors differs between the two classes of companies under consideration. Among the main conclusions, we found that, contrary to the widespread believe, smaller and more independent boards are not always more efficient.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw on the perspectives and experiences of New Zealand board members to propose a balanced scorecard (BSC) for use in measuring and managing the performance of boards. Design/methodology/approach The views of 35 board members were elicited via semi-structured interviews. The interview evidence was analysed using a multi-step coding process to arrive at key themes on the functions, characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. These themes were then used as a basis for proposing an appropriate structure and content for a BSC that reflects board members' perceptions of key factors driving board performance. Findings New Zealand board members see behavioural measures of board performance as generally more useful than operational and financial measures. Further, strong relationships and strategic clarity are seen as both drivers of good performance and key outcomes of effective boards. Consequently, the proposed BSC incorporates multi-dimensional outcome (i.e. lagging) measures. It also recognises the importance of including subjective measures, rather than focusing on readily quantifiable measures that board members perceive as less informative. Research limitations/implications This paper provides insight into the perspectives of practising board members and informs the literature on board effectiveness. The proposed BSC adds to the performance management literature in regard to evaluating and managing the performance of boards. However, further studies are now required to test its practical utility. Practical implications The proposed BSC provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating the performance of boards of directors. Originality/value Few studies of board effectiveness have accessed the views and experiences of practising board members as this study does. Also, little prior research exists on the potential for applying a BSC approach to measuring and managing board performance. (c) Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

I analyze directorships held by CEOs who retired during the periods 1989-1993, 1995-1999 (before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and 2001-2005 (after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). My results suggest that retired CEOs became less popular on boards after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, although pre-retirement accounting performance helps explain the number of outside directorships a retired CEO held in the 1989-1993 sample, as Brickley et al. (1999) have found, it does not explain this number for the 1995-1999 sample and 2001-2005 sample. Third, a company's stock performance during a CEO's tenure is negatively related to the number of outside directorships only in the 2001-2005 sample. Fourth, the number of outside directorships is positively correlated with the size of a retired CEO's original firm before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but this is not the case after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Finally, if retired CEOs worked in regulated industries, their probability of serving at least one outside directorship 2. years after retirement falls by 21% in the 1989-1993 sample. However, this negative effect is marginally significant in the 1995-1999 sample, and vanishes in the 2001-2005 sample. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyzes the relationship between gender diversity on Boards of Directors and business success. For this purpose, the authors used one sample of companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange. The paper analyzes a period of three years, between 2005 and 2007. A descriptive analysis has been carried out. Women's labor status has been studied in these three years. The paper also covers a panel analysis. The results show that there are few women in decision-making positions, and Gender diversity and business success are not related.

What is a board of directors to do, in the face of competing demands on the resources of the company and conflicting perspectives on what their roles are and should be? Corporate governance has become a central theme in management in the past two decades owing to a string of major corporate failures and evidence that the boards of these companies either failed to grasp the scale of the problems or failed to stand up to managers. Those corporations might have set out upon the wrong strategy, or engaged in fraud, or unethical behaviour, or simply suffered from bad luck. Their failures have led to a debate both with industry and in public policy about what mechanisms might prevent a recurrence, not least because they show how great the influence of the corporate sector is on society at large. In this chapter we consider how boards contribute to governing the corporation, the tensions they face along the way, and how theories of corporate governance point to the persistence of those tensions.

The recent financial crisis has raised several questions with respect to the corporate governance of financial institutions. This paper investigates whether risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms, such as for example the presence of a chief risk officer (CRO) in a bank's executive board and whether the CRO reports to the CEO or directly to the board of directors, are associated with a better bank performance during the financial crisis of 2007/2008. We measure bank performance by buy-and-hold returns and ROE and we control for standard corporate governance variables such as CEO ownership, board size, and board independence. Most importantly, our results indicate that banks, in which the CRO directly reports to the board of directors and not to the CEO (or other corporate entities), exhibit significantly higher (i.e., less negative) stock returns and ROE during the crisis. In contrast, standard corporate governance variables are mostly insignificantly or even negatively related to the banks' performance during the crisis. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between environmental reporting and corporate governance attributes of companies in Australia. The paper adopts a quantitative analysis approach. It examines the 2008 annual reports of the largest 100 Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to determine the amount of environmental reporting - these data are compared with various corporate governance measures. Analysis found a significant positive relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and the proportions of independent and female directors on a board. The analysis did not, however, support a negative relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and institutional investors and board size as has been previously predicted, rather, it showed a positive relationship. This paper offers insights to both regulators and company strategists. Regulators such as the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) could consider expanding its Corporate Governance Council guidelines to include consideration of the environment, which is increasingly considered to be an important aspect of corporate social responsibility, and one of the responsibilities of the board of directors. In addition, for companies which include a commitment to the environment in their mission and strategies, it suggests consideration of the impact of board structure and composition is important as both of these are shown to have a significant effect on the amount of environmental information disclosed by companies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate board characteristics on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms. Board characteristics studied comprise board size, board skill, board nationality, board gender, board ethnicity and CEO duality. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the random-effects and fixed-effects generalised least squares (GLS) regression to test the six hypotheses formulated for the study, while controlling for firm size and firm age. Findings: Using panel data from 122 quoted firms in Nigeria between 1991 and 2008, it was found that board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were negatively linked with firm performance, whereas board nationality, board ethnicity and the number of board members with a PhD qualification were found to impact positively on firm performance. The result of the robustness test using the same board characteristics for 160 small firms showed that board duality was positively linked to firm performance, while a PhD qualification was negatively linked to firm performance. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of the board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality and other organisational attributes such as ethnic diversity, foreign nationality and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively. The results provide an insight for practitioners and policy makers on the importance of relying on institutional specifics in the prescription of corporate governance codes. Originality/value: The study adds value to the global corporate governance discourse in two ways: first, the use of Nigeria, which is claimed to have one of the weakest business cultures in the world, and secondly, using a good number of proxies that are country-specific for corporate boards.

The literature disagrees on the link between so-called busy boards (where many independent directors hold multiple board seats) and firm performance. Some argue that busyness certifies a director's ability and that such directors are value enhancing. Others argue that " over-boarded" directors are ineffective and detract from firm value. We find evidence that (1) the disparate results in prior work stem from differences in both sample composition and empirical design, (2) on balance the results suggest a negative association between board busyness and firm performance, and (3) the inclusion of firm fixed effects dramatically affects the conclusions drawn from, and the explanatory power of, multivariate analyses. We also explore alternative empirical definitions of what constitutes a busy director and find that commonly used proxies for busyness perform well relative to more complex alternatives.

Previous research brought evidence of the influence of board composition for bringing strategic resources for innovation, as well as evidence of positive outcomes of board diversity. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of various indicators of board diversity on innovation. In this paper, we will explore the relationship between several aspects of board diversity (gender and age) and four types of innovation, i.e. product, process, organizational, marketing from a sample of 176 French firms based on data from French Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in 2008 and annual reports. Our results show evidence of the influence of board diversity on all types of innovation except process innovation. Findings provide discussions for the impact of board diversity on innovation.

This article analyses the effects of board composition on the behavior of a sample of 114 Italian local public utilities, for which information about 1630 directors during 1994-2004 has been collected. This period is particularly interesting because of the legal changes that forced many firms to alter their juridical form and accommodated the entrance of private investors. We investigate whether board size and/or board composition do affect decisions about employment and how they ultimately impact performance. Our main findings indicate that politically connected directors, who dominate boards of directors in Italian public utilities, exert a positive and significant effect on employment, and have a negative impact on performance.

This study examines the impact of corporate boards on firm performance during the current financial crisis. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the crisis to measure firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we redefine independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call strong independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. We find that the positive impact of outside financial experts on firm performance is more significant than that of strong independence. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Using a hand-collected data set on boards of directors of large US nonfinancial companies, this paper investigates the effects of the presence of a creditor on a company's board. The results suggest that the presence of a creditor: 1) increases the amount of debt in a company's capital structure via an increase in private debt, 2) decreases the sensitivity of debt financing to the amount of tangible assets that a company holds, 3) decreases the cost of borrowing, and 4) reduces the pledge of collateral and financial covenants in debt contracts.

Most organizations focus their attention on simply achieving gender diversity on their boards. This approach misses the point. A complex relationship exists between board gender diversity and good governance whereby such diversity can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on organizational performance, indicating that organizations may only reap the benefits of gender-diverse boards under proper conditions. This article examines which conditions allow gender-diverse boards to flourish and which conditions lead to failure. Organizations usually increase female representation on boards of directors to achieve one of two goals: gender parity or improved governance. Each of these goals is influenced by different circumstances and thus must be approached in a unique manner. Three recommendations are offered herein for organizations trying to achieve each goal. Gender, ethnic, and cultural board diversity all share related justifications and challenges, so organizations that follow the recommendations in this article will be well positioned to benefit from all three sources of increased diversity on their boards of directors.

This paper explores the factors influencing the board composition of an international sample of commercial banks over the period 1996-2006. After considering the dual role of the board as monitor and advisor, our analysis shows that no one board composition is optimal for the banking industry and that any such recommendation could harm bank governance. Our results suggest that more complex banks that have a low ownership concentration and are headquartered in a civil law country should have larger and more independent boards.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to study if and how the evaluation of the boards in the top Nordic male football clubs affects the boards' composition and work. Design/methodology/approachThe study includes all the clubs in the two top divisions in each of the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The study makes use of a questionnaire where 66 (out of 145) chairmen answer 17 questions concerning the board composition and work on a five-point Likert-scale. FindingsThe responses were related to whether the board is annually evaluated or not. Descriptive statistics demonstrates that more than half of the clubs have an annual board evaluation. Most common is that the Chairman performs the evaluation himself/herself with help from designated board members; the evaluation being performed through informal discussions. A total of 44 clubs have a nominee committee. Almost all of the clubs transfer the result of the board evaluation to its nominee committee, most commonly verbally. Furthermore, results show that board evaluation has a significant positive effect on the following functions of football boards: review of business plan, strategy, objective and budget; discussion on short-term development; discussion on long-term development; and work efficiency. Originality/valueThe results of this study are consistent with a similar study of listed Nordic companies. The main difference between the results of the two studies is that clubs, unlike publicly listed companies, almost always perform the evaluation through internal interviews rarely using external consultants and individual anonymous questionnaires.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

The Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2000 emphasises the monitoring role of the Board of Directors, especially that of independent directors. It has not however taken into account the cultural values in Malaysia which do not encourage differences of opinion or criticisms and has failed to provide sufficient safeguards for directors to exercise their role effectively. As a result, it is relatively easy for dominant Chairmen or CEOs especially in government-linked companies or CEO dominated companies to control the Board or senior management with very little opposition. This paper will discuss several incidences of financial mismanagement in companies caused by dominant directors with very little opposition from the rest of the board. It will highlight that the law has to take cultural values more seriously in order to equip the Board and especially independent directors with the ability to challenge dominant Board members.

The Board of Directors plays a key role as a internal mechanism of corporate governance. Indeed, its effectiveness is dependent on the presence of several factors, the most important are related to characteristics that relate primarily to the independence of its members, board size, the cumulative functions of decision and control, the degree of independence of the audit committee and the gender diversity of the board. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board's characteristics and financial performance measured by three different ratios, namely ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we have developed three linear regression models. Our empirical validation was conducted on a sample of 26 companies listed on the Tunisian stock exchange Tunis (Tunis Stock Exchange) over a period that spans four years (2007-2010). The estimated models show satisfactory results showing the importance of the impact of board characteristics on financial performance of Tunisian companies.

Private and community grantmaking foundations are part of the U.S. nonprofit sector, although they primarily distribute funds rather than seek them. Like all nonprofit organizations, they are governed by a board of directors or trustees. Despite normative expectations that members of charitable boards work without compensation, many grantmaking foundations provide fees and other benefits to their trustees. Although these payments are required by law to be reasonable and necessary, some compensation is demonstrably high and occasionally incidental to the effective operation of the foundation. This article documents and probes the practice of individual and institutional trustee compensation in the 10,000 largest U.S. grantmaking foundations. It shows that the practice is common, if not widespread. Typical trustee compensation is not necessarily unreasonable, although cases in the upper distribution might deserve more regulatory and public scrutiny. Independent foundations, larger foundations, those with staff, and those with any endowment are most likely to engage in individual trustee compensation.

Banks, particularly those considered too big to fail, pose a particular governance challenge, especially for taxpayers who face an undiversifiable risk of being the final backstop of the financial system. The nexus of bank governance is the board of directors, but they have proven inadequate in controlling the riskiness of bank activities, an outcome due both of the complexity of modern banks, and because boards are uncertain about what is expected of them. Using an interdisciplinary approach from law and accounting, we propose a two-step procedure to improve bank governance. First, we give bank directors an explicit standard to assess the outcome of their actions: the Prudent Investor rule which is the requirement for trusts. Adopting the Prudent Investor rule would return to director's responsibility to control the risks of banking activities. To enforce the higher standard, we propose to use disclosure as a disciplining mechanism. We base the new disclosure regime on Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires managers to implement controls over the firm's financial reporting processes and to publicly attest to their effectiveness. This section failed to prevent the credit crisis because it was too narrowly focused. We recommend that the provision be broadened to encompass governance controls in general, and that responsibility for disclosure be placed on the bank board rather than on managers.

Dilek Demirbas, Andrey Yukhanaev and Roman Stepanov 22.1 INTRODUCTION All organizations around the world, regardless of either Western or Eastern origin, are currently undergoing significant changes. One of the major changes within these organizations is corporate governance, and these changes in corporate governance have become the focus of all related parties such as directors, investors, stakeholders and regulators. Indeed, Tricker (2000), considering the evolution of business environment and corporate development, postulated the following chronology: entrepreneurship as a nineteenth-century phenomenum, management prevalence as a catalytic force in the twentieth century and corporate governance as a leitmotif of modern times. The common conclusion of all parties involved is that companies across the world need to adopt commonly accepted corporate governance standards in order to attract foreign capital, to become internationally more competitive and to deal with corporate governance problems in today's economic environment. With the intention of providing the best and most commonly accepted international corporate governance standards, in 1999 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed an international corporate governance code and global principles of 'good' governance. In 2004, the OECD revised its previous attempt, Principles of Corporate Governance and defined 'good corporate governance'. Since the date of first publication, the OECD Principles (1999, 2004) have gained substantial recognition worldwide as a framework for reforms and a reference point for corporate governance literature. Now, there is a positive tendency among company directors around the world to support reforms, partly as a result of increasing international pressures to harmonize corporate....

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

This article analyzes whether political connections of the board of directors of publicly traded companies in the USA affect the allocation of government procurement contracts. It focuses on the change in control of both House and Senate following the 1994 election and finds that companies with boards connected to the winning (losing) party experience a significant and large increase (decrease) in procurement contracts after the election. The results remain significant after controlling for industry classifications as well as for several other company characteristics. The findings highlight one of the main avenues through which corporate political connections add value to US companies. (c) 2013 The Authors 2013.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

We examine the rewards for experience and ability in the director labor market. We show that large acquisitions are associated with significantly higher numbers of subsequent board seats for the acquiring CEO, target CEO, and the directors. We also find that, in the case of acquisitions, experience is more important than ability. Both value-destroying and value-increasing acquisitions have significant and positive effects on a CEO's future prospects in the director labor market. In addition to increasing our understanding of the director labor market, these results suggest that the ex post settling-up incentives thought to exist in the director labor market are weak for acquisitions.

Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to examine the influence of the educational qualifications of board members, including the CEO, on the financial performance of Indonesian listed firms. Indonesia is a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a sample comprising 160 firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) are used as measures of financial performance. It uses four proxies for board members' educational qualifications, namely postgraduate degrees, degrees obtained from prestigious universities, degrees obtained from developed countries, and degrees in financial disciplines. Regressions are performed separately for the supervisory board, management board, and CEO. Findings - This study provides empirical evidence that the educational qualifications of board members and the CEO matter, to a particular extent, in explaining either ROA or Tobin's Q. For example, CEOs holding degrees from prestigious domestic universities perform significantly better than those without such qualifications. Practical implications - Even though intellectual competence should appear to be one of the considerations in the appointment of board members, educational qualification is not always a good proxy for superior advising or managerial quality. There may be many other factors that need to be considered, such as experiences, managerial skills, networks, and other skills obtained outside schools. As such, the establishment of a nomination committee, which is expected to provide independent recommendations on qualified candidates to serve in the boardrooms, plays an important role. Originality/value - Empirical studies focusing on the influence of the educational backgrounds of board members and the CEO on financial performance are still rare in the literature. This study is among the first to address such an issue in the context of a developing economy. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

While most economic organisation literature on cooperatives has focused on changes in income rights, we study changes in the allocation of decision rights between board of directors (representing members) and managers. The traditional role of the board is to direct the activities of the managers. However, professional management increasingly makes most strategic decisions, pushing the board into a supervisory role. We present two groups of findings on changing board-management relationships. We identify three corporate governance models: traditional, management and corporation. And we present an empirical illustration showing a relationship between the choice of board model, and product portfolio and performance. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the gender composition of the 99 most liquid Brazilian companies listed in the Brazilian stock exchange (BM&FBovespa) in 2011. It proposes a discussion about gender inequality in Brazilian companies and provides data, made available for the first time to national and international literature, on gender composition in Brazilian boards. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative study, whose data were collected from the Annual Report of Corporate Governance of Listed Companies 2011 prepared by the Capital Aberto magazine on the makeup of the boards of the 100 most liquid Brazilian publicly traded companies. Descriptive multivariate regression tests were carried out to refine these findings. Findings: The results show that only 5.4 per cent of the positions in the boards of these companies are occupied by women. Firms that have been listed for longer in the stock market and have more seats in their boards are more likely to have women directors in these boards, suggesting gender inequality in the 99 companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: This study has a limitation with regards to the type of female board members in the sample. In other words, the authors were unable to determine if they were external or internal to the companies. Practical implications: The study discusses gender inequality in Brazilian companies and contributes to the debate on a governmental proposal to adopt quota legislation to increase the number of women in boards of directors. Originality/value: This study fulfils an identified need to know more about the gender composition of Brazilian boards. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examined the association between corporate transparency and ethical orientation of Fortune 500 companies and the number of females represented on the board of directors from the Fortune (2010) annual report data. Our basis for this judgment was whether the firm was listed on either (both) Ethisphere Magazine's "2010 World's Most Ethical Companies" (Ethisphere Magazine 2011) or (and) Corporate Responsibility Magazine's "100 Best Corporate Citizens 2010" (Corporate Responsibility Magazine 2011) list(s). Our results indicated that, as the number of women directors increased, the probability of a corporation appearing on these lists increased. We also found that a ''critical mass'' of women directors was indicated by the data for Ethisphere Magazine's but not Corporate Responsibility Magazine's list.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance on the performance of 37 commercial banks in Kenya over the period 2005-2009. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two measures of performance, i.e. return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), and the dependent variables and three measures of governance - namely the board size, independent directors, and CEO duality - as the key independent variables. The study follows a panel econometrics technique to investigate the relationship between governance variables and bank performance. Findings: The main findings are as follows: a large board size tends to impact performance negatively; the existence of independent board directors tends to enhance the performance of the banks; and there is no evidence that CEO duality or otherwise has impact on the performance of commercial banks in Kenya. Practical implications: The study therefore recommends that for commercial banks in Kenya to register high performance they need to check the size of their board of directors and also increase the number of independent directors. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study on Kenya that has used advanced panel data techniques. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction effect of auditor industry specialization and board governance on earnings management. This study examines whether board independence is more or less effective in constraining earnings management for firms audited by industry specialists than for firms audited by non-specialists. Design/methodology/approach: The US data were collected from the RiskMetrics Directors database and the Compustat database. Regression analysis was used to test the research proposition. Findings: It was found that earnings management is more negatively associated with board independence for firms audited by industry specialists than for firms audited by non-specialists, consistent with the notion that there is a complementary relationship between auditor industry specialization and board governance. The findings suggest a positive interaction effect of auditor industry specialization and board governance on accounting quality. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by documenting explicit evidence that high quality boards can be more effective through hiring industry specialist auditors. This study also suggests that it may be worth investigating the interaction effect among different corporate governance mechanisms on accounting quality. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

Since the beginnings of the global debate over corporate governance in the early 1990s, academics, practitioners and policymakers have focused on changing boards of directors to improve corporate governance. The financial crisis of 2007-09 arose despite two decades of codification of corporation governance, a process that continues in the light of concern about corporate performance and accountability: codes have not eliminated the problems they set out to address. Analysing the three main versions of the UK code of corporate governance, we see a shifting discourse of 'structures' in Cadbury to 'independence' under the reforms in 2003, and then in the 2010 iteration towards 'behaviour', as the code seeks to improve boards as mechanisms of corporate governance. The evolution in the language and recommendations of the code reveals growing understanding both of the practical challenge of board effectiveness and of the limitations to codification.

This paper investigates the association between board characteristics and shareholders' assessment of their exposure to economic and agency risks as reflected in the volatility of stock returns. Our hypotheses incorporate prior evidence that small and large firms have 'dramatically' different board structures, reflecting the firms' different monitoring and advising needs. We hypothesize and find evidence that only the shareholders of well-established large firms are able to generate positive net benefits, in the form of lower equity risk, from independent boards and well-connected independent directors with multiple directorships. We also find professional and formal industry degree qualifications on the board are associated with shareholders' risk assessment for some small firms consistent with the focus of small firms on building growth and scale. While we find evidence that formal industry professional affiliations (weak evidence) and MBAs provide benefits for the shareholders of large firms, there is limited evidence that financial expertise on the board systematically influences shareholders' risk assessments for small or large companies. The key conclusion from the evidence in this paper is that a 'one size fits all' approach to governance in relation to the board of directors may not meet the diverse needs of companies at different stages of economic development.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

The board of directors plays a key role as an internal mechanism of corporate governance. Indeed, its effectiveness is dependent on the presence of several factors, the most important are related to characteristics that relate primarily to the independence of its members, board size, the cumulative functions of decision and control, the degree of independence of the audit committee and the gender diversity of the board. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board's characteristics and financial performance measured by three different ratios, namely ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we have developed three linear regression models. Our empirical validation was conducted on a sample of 26 companies listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over a period that spans four years (2007-2010). The estimated models show satisfactory results showing the importance of the impact of board characteristics on financial performance of Tunisian companies. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: This paper deals with the relationship existing between the emotional aspect and decision-making processes. More specifically, it examines the links between emotional intelligence, decision biases and effectiveness of the governance mechanisms. The primary purposes of this paper are to: consider emotional intelligence as new research ideas that make important contributions to society; offer suggestions for improving manuscripts submitted to Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations; and discuss methods for enhancing the validity of inferences made from research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper explains that the main cause of organization's problems is CEO emotional intelligence level. The authors use three models (linear regression and logistic binary regression) to examine this relation: every model treats the relationship between emotional intelligence and one of efficiency criteria of the board. Emotional intelligence has been measured according to Schutte et al.'s Shutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Scale (SSREI), with a high internal validity level. The four cognitive biases have been measured by means of a questionnaire comprising several items and the selected sample was composed of some180 Tunisian executives (belonging to 60 firms). Findings: The results revealed that the presence of a high emotional intelligence rate is not always positively correlated with the executives' suggestibility with respect to behavioural biases. They have also affirmed the existence of a complementarity relationship between emotional intelligence and the directors' board. Authors need to consider that emotion which minimizes CEO emotional biases and provides director's board effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: This article has implications for the development of CEO emotional intelligence capacity. Also, some psychological aspects of a theoretical nature could not be wholly approached in a complete empirical way. Practical implications: The paper pushes organizations to select managers based on their levels of emotional intelligence (apply tests of emotional intelligence in place psychometric tests). Also, it increases the validity of inferences made from research in the field. Social implications: This paper incites governments to establish training programs aimed at the development of learning of emotional intelligence. Thus, it has important implications for enhancing the well-being of individuals, organizations and society as a whole. Originality/value: Actually, for the sake improving the explanatory power of a legal-financial approach of governance, the behavioural dimension has been integrated for a more thorough analysis of the directors' board role. The authors' goal consists in highlighting the role played by emotional intelligence as a skill or tool available for the manager or controller to minimize the behavioural biases (bias of loss aversion, optimism, over-confidence and lack of cognitive flexibility), and achieves an effective control.

This paper examines the influence and causal relationship between board of directors independence, CEO duality, and firm value. By estimating multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, there resulted a positive influence of the percentage of independent directors on firm value, but down to a threshold of their representation of 47.23 percent, whereupon their influence becomes negative. When we employed fixed-effects models, the relationship previously mentioned was not statistically validated. However, the results provide support for a lack of statistically significant relationship between the percentage of non-executive directors and firm value. Besides, by estimating fixed-effects models we found a positive influence of CEO duality on industry-adjusted Tobin's Q ratio, but not statistically significant when estimating models without cross-sectional effects. The causal relationships between board independence and firm value identified based on Granger causality are not robust. (c) 2013, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Purpose: If proficient boards result in better governance, as the literature on the subject generally suggests, engaging independent directors and having in place an effective audit committee would certainly facilitate productive corporate functioning and enhanced accountability. Motivated by such a viewpoint, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the reporting quality and performance of the Indian central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and its private counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The well premeditated propositions of the study resulted in a final sample comprising 47 CPSEs and 30 peer companies. The auditors' report on financial statements was scanned to determine the quality of company's accounting and financial reporting systems. The BSE-500 Index companies were ranked on select financial parameters to gauge relative performance of the sample companies. Findings: An analysis of the CPSEs shows that non-compliance with the corporate governance provisions with regards to the required number of independent directors on the board did not have any concomitant effect on their performance. Further, an examination of auditors' report revealed that the CPSEs provide a better insight into books of accounts, unlike the private sector. Originality/value: The study is timely and relevant, given the expanded role of the state and renewed interest in boards. A case for collaborative engagement between the government and the corporate sector is proposed to address legal as well as regulatory lacunae for building trust and fostering good corporate governance. To ensure better compliance and enforcement of financial regulations it envisions an integrated accounting/auditing and taxation administration platform. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This is the first paper which aims to investigate factors that might influence the gender composition of boards of directors of Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs). Design/methodology/approach: This study follows Mateos de Cabo, Gimeno and Nieto and the gender diversity literature and investigates the existence and number of women directors on the boards of directors of 37 A-REITs from 2006 to 2011. Findings: There is evidence that larger (by market capitalization) A-REITs are more likely to employ a woman director and that A-REITs with larger boards are more likely to employ a woman director and indeed more women directors. It also appears that A-REITs whose head office is in Sydney are more likely to employ a woman director and also more women directors. Practical implications: Women seeking to be engaged as directors of A-REITs are more likely to be employed by larger A-REITs (by market capitalization), those with larger boards and those located in Sydney. Originality/value: This paper adds to the existing literature on gender diversity by examining the factors that appear to influence the employment of women on A-REIT Boards.

In this study we analyze the effect of latent managerial characteristics on corporate governance. We find that CEO and board chair fixed effects explain a significant portion of the variation in board size, board independence, and CEO-chair duality even after controlling for several firm characteristics and firm fixed effects. The effect of CEOs on corporate governance practices is attributable mainly to executives who simultaneously hold the position of CEO and board chair in the same firm. Our results do not show a decline in CEO discretionary influence on corporate governance after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and stock exchange governance regulations.

We investigate whether boards of directors adjust compensation contracts to lengthen a CEO's decision horizon, and if the use of such contract adjustments depends on the levels of external (i.e., shareholder-based) and internal (i.e., boardbased) CEO monitoring. Based on insights from the career-concerns literature, we identify short-horizon CEOs as those nearing retirement, at a firm with a current earnings decline or loss, and/or with an impending job change. We find that firms with a CEO identified as having a short-horizon place greater contract weight on forward-looking information. This horizon-lengthening contract adjustment is less pronounced when there is greater external monitoring (i.e., as proxied by a high level of shareholder rights), consistent with the intuition that increased shareholder rights mitigate CEO entrenchment, leading to less myopic decision making, independent of a contract adjustment. However, we also find that the horizon-lengthening contract adjustment is more pronounced when there is greater internal monitoring (i.e., as proxied by characteristics of the board), consistent with the intuition that increased employment risk from more intense internal monitoring itself creates a demand for increased incentive weights as a means of compensating the CEO for the increased risk.

Purpose - To explore the importance of the board of director nomination process (that is, who nominates a given director for a position on the firm's board) for the voting outcomes, disciplining of management, and overall monitoring quality of the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach - We exploit a recent regulation passed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requiring disclosure of the board nomination process. In particular, we focus on firms' use of executive search firms versus allowing internal members (often simply the CEO) to nominate new directors to serve on the board of directors. Findings - We show that companies that use search firms to find board members pay their CEOs significantly higher salaries and significantly higher total compensations. Further, companies with search firmidentified independent directors are significantly less likely to fire their CEOs following negative performance. In addition, companies with search firm-identified independent directors are significantly more likely to engage in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and see abnormally low returns from this M&A activity. We instrument the endogenous choice of using an executive search through the varying geographic distance of companies to executive search firms. Using this instrumental variable framework, we show search firm-identified independent directors' negative impact on firm performance, consistent with firm behavior and governance consequences we document. Originality/value - Given the recent law passage, we are the first to directly analyze the nomination process, and show a surprisingly large predictive effect of seemingly arm's-length nominations. This has clear implications for thinking carefully through how independence is defined in the director nomination process. Copyright (c) 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

Banks are in the business of taking risks. The 3 pillars of Basel II capital accord highlight the crucial role of informative risk disclosures in enhancing market discipline. The specific role and responsibilities of the board of directors or supervisory boards in banking institutions continue, however, to fuel debate. Findings of the literature are often inconclusive. The main contribution of this study is examining how board characteristics affect risk in banking industry. We explore this relationship by using many econometric approaches. The empirical analysis based on a sample of 11 Tunisian conventional banks over the period 2001-2011 reports the following results when using GLS RE: small and dual functions boards are associated with more insolvency risk but have no significant effect on credit and global risks. The presence of independent directors within the board generates an increase in global risk but has no significant effect on insolvency and credit risks. A lower CEO ownership has no significant effect with all measures of risks. Finally, banking capitalization is associated with more insolvency risk, and small size banks assume lower credit risk. These findings are performed by using a GMM in system approach.

Corporate managers play a critical role in corporate governance and financial performance, and continuing the development of corporate governance and financial performance becomes an important consideration in selecting enterprise successors. The past research mostly focused on the discussions between corporate governance and financial performance, but not from the perspective on enterprise successor selection. For this reason, the relationship between corporate governance, financial performance, and enterprise successor selection is discussed in this study. The research outcomes conclude that: 1.Corporate governance presents significantly positive effects on financial performance, 2. Enterprise successor selection has remarkably positive effect on corporate governance, 3. Enterprise successor selection shows notably positive effect on financial performance, and 4. Enterprise successor selection reveals remarkably moderating effect on the relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. Consequently, it is suggested to take enterprise successor selection into account when developing corporate governance and financial performance strategies.

The compensation of boards of directors and supervisors is higher in firms with lower earnings, than that of boards of directors and supervisors in corresponding industries with higher earnings. Using firm-level panel data of Taiwan Stock Exchange listed firms over the period 1999-2008, this study investigates the reasons for this phenomenon of rewarding failure. The result provides evidence that rewarding failure is due to an asymmetric reward scheme and human capital retention, and it encourages the board to make aggressive decisions.

Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study gender diversity on the board of directors and the relation to risk management and corporate performance as measured by the variability of stock market return. Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of companies from the RiskMetrics database from 2007 to 2011. This database contains information on corporate board of directors. Financial variables were collected from the Compustat database and CRSP database for the years 2005-2011. The authors then measure the effect of gender diversity on corporate performance in terms of firm risk, using the model by Cheng (2008) which measures the variability of stock market return. Findings - The study shows that more gender diversity on the board of directors impacts firm risk by contributing to lower variability of stock market return. The higher the percentage of female directors on the board, the lower the variability of corporate performance. Originality/value - The research design and findings assist in providing additional evidence about the role of women in corporate leadership positions and the association with corporate performance. The approach combines Cheng's (2008) model of stock market variability with the impact of gender diversity on the board of directors. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

The last two decades have witnessed substantial scholarly interest in corporate boards, yet little research has been devoted to boards of international joint ventures (IJVs). We combine the corporate governance and alliance governance literatures in order to study this important ex post governance mechanism for IJVs. We identify a fundamental tension inherent in IJVs, which arises from the unique features of this organizational form and influences the level of involvement by their boards. International joint ventures are hybrid organizational forms that can require administrative control to facilitate monitoring and coordinated adaptation in the presence of exchange hazards. At the same time, the fact that IJVs operate in different host countries can make it efficient to delegate authority to local management for certain collaborations. In investigating the determinants of IJV board involvement, we therefore examine characteristics of IJVs that reflect this underlying tension. We conclude that board involvement reflects efficiency considerations in individual ventures, and the administrative control provided by boards is an important dimension of IJV governance.

This study examined the impact of board of director characteristics on nonprofit performance. Using data collected through a survey of nonprofit colleges and universities, the author provides evidence that specific board member characteristics are vital in shaping the financial and nonfinancial success of nonprofit institutions of higher education. Results indicate that both board member diversity and expertise are associated with better-performing organizations. This work makes important initial forays into the relationships between board of director qualities and nonprofit performance. Although limited by the relatively small sample of colleges and universities, this study is unique in its ability to analyze nonprofit boards and both financial and nonfinancial performance measures.

Boards of directors and corporate governance have gained much attention in recent years. Many reforms have been made, especially on board composition to ensure that boards of directors are effective, in order to improve corporate governance. The Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance codified the best practices of good governance and described optimal corporate governance structures. However, due to a different context for business practices and the nature of the business environment in emerging markets, we expect that the determinants of board structure will differ from those in developed markets. Our study investigates the determinants of board structure for Malaysian firms from 2000 to 2007. We also examine trends in corporate board structure and the level of compliance of boards of directors in Malaysia with the requirements of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance. Overall, we find that after an increase at the beginning of the study period, and then a decrease, board size remained globally stable over the period studied while board independence has shown an upward trend in recent years.Our results also suggest that board size and board independence are correlated with the operation level of the firms. Unlike most findings in the US market, we find no evidence that the measures under the monitoring hypothesis are related to board independence, which requires further investigation on the monitoring role played by Malaysian boards.

This article examines the failure path of newly-incorporated companies and determines the impact of founder director/board characteristics on survival. Hypotheses are tested regarding director characteristics within a discrete-time hazard model which controls for macro-economic conditions, recursive relationships and all non-insolvency exits. Regarding the estimation method, analysis of the variables' average marginal effects is helpful in unravelling the subtleties of these effects, being used to confirm the magnitude and economic significance of the results. The study utilises a unique dataset of more than 5.8m company-year observations (near population) of newly-incorporated companies and early-stage board characteristics. Results suggest that the background, experience, networking, gender diversity and composition of new boards are important in determining the trajectory of success or failure of new firms.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

This empirical study challenges the theory that a 'critical mass' of three or more women at the boardroom table is needed to make a difference. Performance ratings of Canadian publicly traded companies by the Globe and Mail show consistently higher corporate governance scores for companies with more women on their boards of directors. However, while companies that had three or more women on their boards had the highest scores, companies with only one woman on the board scored significantly higher than those with none. There was also no relationship between the number of women on boards of directors and Corporate Knights' social responsibility ratings on a national or global basis. The size of board and the type of industry are other important factors to consider when proposing quotas for female board members. (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

For the last two decades, board diversity is increasingly considered as a significant mechanism of good corporate governance. Thus, the question arises whether a heterogeneously or rather a homogenously composed board contributes to the efficiency of a company's management and monitoring. Especially national and international regulators and standard setters consider board diversity to be associated with an increasing firm performance. Therefore, the economic impact of board diversity aspects needs to be investigated empirically. This study examines the relationship between diversity within management boards and corporate performance for the German two-tier system by presenting a comprehensive literature analysis as well as an empirical analysis based on 149 publicly listed German organizations for the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Hence, management board diversity is characterized by attributes, such as gender, age, nationality and functionality. An analysis comparable to the one at hand including multiple dimensions for German companies has not been performed, yet. We mostly find negative effects of various board diversity characteristics on corporate performance, especially regarding age and national diversity. This may be due to the fact that great internationality on boards can decrease communication between board members and large age differences may alleviate decision-making processes.

In this article, we conduct a longitudinal study of women's progress on French corporate boards of directors. We particularly focus on the extent to which women directors have circumvented the glass ceiling. Using a sample of SBF 120 companies over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009, our results provide evidence of a significant increase in the number of women on French corporate boards. However, the corporate glass ceiling hypothesis is consistently rejected whatever the considered measure of female directors; i.e., the number of board seats held by women, the number of firms with a critical mass of female directors, and the number of directorships held by each women director.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the research in this field on the portrayal of women and the effect this has on boards and corporate image, as well as to propose a theoretical framework for further research on the effects of media stereotypes. The theoretical model aims to analyze the media's effect on female board members, and how this helps in the process of changing stereotypes or whether it consolidates existing preconceptions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the existing literature on the subject and proposes a theoretical model for future research, contributing thus in opening a new line of research in the field of the roles of women on boards. Findings: The conclusions reached will have important consequences for the future of women on boards in relation to three fundamental issues: the types of women that join boards of directors, the type of female profile companies search for and the roles women are expected to play on those boards. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institution to reflect on potential gender biases. Practical implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institutions and media agents to reflect on potential gender biases. Originality/value: An important body of literature already exists showing how the portrayal of women can reinforce or eliminate barriers to access membership of a board of directors. There is also a solid body of literature showing the media's effect on transmitting or changing preconceived ideas about women in business, as well as the potential impact of appointing them - through the influence of different stakeholders - on a company's image. However, there has been little substantial research carried out on the media's effect on gender diversity on boards. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We study the stock market's reaction to the unexpected death of a top executive or board chair for insight into grey director incentives. Whereas there is little debate as to the motives of inside and strict outside directors, the allegiance of grey directors is less certain. We find that grey directors' dominant incentive depends on whether the firm has a succession plan or not. In firms with a succession plan, grey directors' primary motive is to maintain their business ties to the firm. Absent a succession plan, the stock market expects grey directors to use their influence to hire a higher quality replacement, particularly when these directors hold a large equity stake. Our findings suggest that grey directors place their interests as shareholders first when a replacement decision is likely to weaken their business ties with the firm. Grey directors appear to influence the choice of a higher quality replacement whether that person is an insider or outsider. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The recent financial crisis has raised several questions with respect to the corporate governance of financial institutions. This paper investigates whether boards of directors and risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms are associated with a better bank performance during the financial crisis of 2007/2008 for a sample of Chinese and Indian listed banks. We measure market bank performance by Tobin' Q and price-earnings ratio. In line with the previous literature on US banks, we find the general irrelevance of the standard board's variables when specific variables related to the risk committee are included in the analysis. We find that the market valuation and the expected market growth (Tobin' Q and P/E) are larger for banks with smaller risk committee. In particular, we find that the market valuation is negatively associated with the size of the risk committee and positively associated with the number of the risk committee' meetings. This seems to suggest that the market discounts as favorable the information related to "strong" risk governance. (c) 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Using a sample of 40 French companies listed on the SBF 120 for the period 2002-2009, we examine if board structure (board size, independence of its members and the cumulative functions of decision and control) relate to their performance. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board structure and financial performance measured by four different ratios, namely ROA, ROE, Tobin's Q and Market to Book, we have developed four dynamic panel system GMM approach to control for relevant sources of endogeneity (simultaneity, reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity). Our results support the idea, commonly accepted, that board structure is a determinant factor for French firm performance. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Ryan and Haslam (2005) report that women are appointed to senior leadership roles at firms that have recently experienced poor financial performance thus placing the appointee in a precarious position with a higher probability of failure. In contrast to the widely cited concept of the "glass ceiling," Ryan and Haslam's view their 2005 result as evidence of a "glass cliff" for females. However, there has been limited empirical support for this view, plus some contradictory findings (Adams, Gupta, and Leeth, 2009). To further test Ryan and Haslam's hypothesis, this study uses a larger and updated dataset of female board member appointments for Canada. The findings, based on a matched sample methodology, suggest that the glass cliff phenomenon is not apparent for board level appointments made in Canada. In fact, the finding of superior stock market performance in the pre-appointment period for companies appointing female directors may suggest the existence of a solid ledge, not a glass cliff, for female board appointees. In addition, the finding of superior market performance in the post-appointment period for companies that appoint males to the board supports Judge's (2003) antidotal study that motivated this type of research. Overall, the paper further advances the research concerning the theory of a glass cliff.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This research paper examines the relationship between the board of directors and the firm's performance from the angle of the R&D investment level in the French context and from some perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to show if the R&D investment level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the size of the board, and on the other hand, the performance. This empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationships between the variables linked to the composition of the board and the firm's performance are meditated by the firm's R&D investment level.

This article investigates the determinants of board compensation for a sample of Italian state owned enterprises (SOEs). To that purpose, we use newly collected panel data of 106 local public utilities observed from 1994 through 2004, which includes detailed information on the boards of directors. During this period, the deregulation process inspired institutional interventions that forced utilities, traditionally owned by local municipalities, to change their juridical form and ownership structure, thereby facilitating the entrance of private investors. The corporate governance literature shows that such changes may exacerbate the agency conflicts between shareholders, top executives and the board. However, board compensation could reduce the agency costs by aligning the incentives of managers with the interests of shareholders. This article addresses this issue by investigating the impact that board composition, firm characteristics and performance have on board compensation. We find that the average board pay is positively related to firm dimension and negatively related to board size. The public or private nature of the major shareholder does not influence board compensation but the juridical form does. Finally, while the proportion of politically connected directors is found to negatively influence the level of per capita compensation, the impact of firm performance is uncertain.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the monitoring effectiveness of insider-dominated boards and outsider-dominated boards on different types of CEOs. Design/methodology/approach - To test whether boards monitor inside CEOs and outside CEOs differently and to compare the sizes of the effects across board types, the paper relates CEO resignations to performance measure. The paper tests the hypotheses using logit models to estimate the probability of a CEO change. Findings - It is widely believed that only an outsider-dominated board can provide effective management oversight. The paper finds evidence supporting this view after categorized CEOs based on their affiliation with their firms upon hire. However, the paper also documents that after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), an insider-dominated board is just as effective as an outsider board in monitoring if the CEO was initially hired from outside of the firm. This suggests that there is no difference between insider and outsider board monitoring of outside CEOs. Therefore, after SOX, as far as board monitoring is concerned, what matters is the independence between the CEO and the firm rather than the board structure itself. Research limitations/implications - If effective board monitoring is the reason of the revised listing standards approved by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2003 to require companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq to have a board that is composed of a majority of independent (or outsider) directors, the paper has provided more flexibility and choices to the listed firms. For example, firms that will be better off with insider boards can choose to hire outside CEOs because monitoring effects on outside CEOs are the same regardless of board types after SOX. Originality/value - The results of this paper have interesting implication. First, the paper has shown that an outsider-dominated board is still a better monitor even after categorized CEOs based on their affiliation with their firms upon hire. Second, if effective board monitoring is the reason of the revised listing standards approved by SEC in 2003 to require companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq to have a board that is composed of a majority of independent (or outsider) directors, the paper has provided more flexibility and choices to the listed firms. For example, firms that will be better off with insider boards can choose to hire outside CEOs because monitoring effects on outside CEOs are the same regardless of board types after SOX.

Gender diversity at board level is probably one of the most controversially discussed topics among policy-makers, in business and, in society today. This study examines female board appointments between 2007 and 2012. Subsequently, an event study is performed covering 30 announcements of female board appointments during this period. The findings demonstrate significant positive stock market reactions to the announcement of women entering a corporate board, suggesting that investors on average believe that female directors add value. Thus, female board appointments appear to be a significant instrument in enhancing shareholder value. Also, this study has found that the dissemination of information about female board appointments prior to the official appointment tends to significantly positively influence stock returns.

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

This chapter examines the relation between corporate governance mechanisms and operating performance and liquidity risk within the specific environment ofWest African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) banks. The implementation of well-known western corporate governance mechanisms in emerging markets, which mostly focus on unsophisticated financial services, is likely to act more as operating constraints than value-creation factors. Based on a sample drawn from 98 commercial banks over the period 2006-2010, we document the following three main findings: (1) dual structure and board size are significantly negatively associated with banks' performance as proxied by Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), (2) dual structure and board diversity exhibit a significant negative relation with banks' liquidity risk, (3) the presence of chief executive officer (CEO) in the board of directors appears to be the only corporate governance mechanism efficiently associated with banks' liquidity risk.

We formulate theory on the effect of board of director gender diversity on the broad spectrum of securities fraud, and generate three key insights. First, based on ethicality, risk aversion, and diversity, we hypothesize that gender diversity on boards can operate as a significant moderator for the frequency of fraud. Second, we advance that the stock market response to fraud from a more gender-diverse board is significantly less pronounced. Third, we posit that women are more effective in male-dominated industries in reducing both the frequency and severity of fraud. Results of our novel empirical tests, based on data from a large sample of Chinese firms that committed securities fraud, are largely consistent with each of these hypotheses.

The performance and accountability of boards of directors and effectiveness of governance mechanisms continue to be a matter of concern. Focusing on differences between conventional banks and Islamic banks, we examine the effect of (i) Shari'ah supervision boards, (ii) board structure and (iii) CEO-power on performance during the period 2005-2011. We find Shari'ah supervision boards positively impact on Islamic banks' performance when they perform a supervisory role, but the impact is negligible when they have only an advisory role. The effect of board structure (board size and board independence) and CEO power (CEO-chair duality and internally recruited CEO) on the performance of Islamic banks is overall negative. Our findings provide support for the positive contribution of Shari'ah supervision boards but also emphasize the need for enforcement and regulatory mechanism for them to be more effective.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

Utilising a sample of Asian firms from Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, this study shows that increasing numbers of female directors on the board have a positive effect on firm performance, as measured by return on equity (ROE). However, the positive effects of gender diversity appear to be diminished in countries with higher female economic participation and empowerment. This may be due to tokenism and suggests that forcing female director appointment or mandating gender quotas can reduce firm performance in countries with strong cultural resistance.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The present study empirically analyses the association between board of directors' composition and capital structure. Particularly, the fraction of independent directors on the board, the fraction of female directors, the board size, and whether the chief executive officer (CEO) is also the chairman of the board are analyzed. Consistent with the pecking order theory of Myers (1984) and Myers and Majluf (1984) the results provide strong evidence that firms with a larger fraction of independent directors on the board have a capital structure composed with more external capital when compared with retained earnings; have more short term debt in relation with retained earnings; have more long term debt compared with short term debt; and have more external equity than long term debt. The results also provide some evidence that a more gender diversified board of directors and where the chairman is non-executive (i.e. the CEO is a different person from that of the chairman) can improve the board of directors' independence and efficiency and therefore lead the firm to have a capital structure composed with more long term sources of financing.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insights on the gender-performance relationship, this paper studies the impact of board gender diversity on firm performance, by taking into account the "critical mass" of women directors and their educational level. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested on a unique dataset of 211 European Union publicly listed companies in 2012 belonging to the construction industry from 28 different countries through a set of ordinary least squares regressions. Findings - The evidence shows that the "critical mass" rather than the simple presence of women has an incremental benefit on firm performance. In addition, results show that the educational level of women directors negatively affects firm performance, as it might impact the dynamics within the boardroom. Research limitations/implications - The quantitative nature of the study does not allow drawing strong inferences on behavioral processes and dynamics in and around the boardroom. Nevertheless, this study will open new research insights on exploring the educational level on board. Practical implications - Regulators and policymakers that should be aware of the influence of women as a group on firm performance and that this role is differential across industries. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper is that it investigates the role of women in a high masculine gender-specific industry and explores a still poorly understood demographic variable (i.e. the educational level) of women directors.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

The recent financial crisis has raised several questions with respect to the corporate governance of financial institutions. This paper investigates whether boards of directors and risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms are associated with a better bank performance during the financial crisis of 2007/2008 for a sample of Chinese and Indian listed banks. We measure bank performance by Tobin's Q, return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and price-earnings ratio (P/E). In line with the previous literature on US banks, we find the general irrelevance of the standard board's variables when specific variables related to the risk committee are included in the analysis. The positive relationship between the size of the risk committee and ROE and ROA suggests that, over the period 2007-2011, banks with larger risk committee perform better in terms of profitability. However, the market valuation and the expected market growth (Tobin's Q and P/E) are larger for banks with smaller risk committee. In particular, we find that the market valuation is negatively associated with the size of the risk committee and positively associated with the number of the risk committee' meetings. This seems to suggest that the market discounts as favorable the information related to "strong" risk governance. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We study the relation between the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. We argue that substantial age dissimilarity between the two-giving rise to cognitive conflict-increases board monitoring and firm value for firms with greater monitoring needs. We find evidence for our hypothesis using data on German two-tier boards. German law mitigates endogeneity concerns as it prevents CEO duality and also restricts CEO power in other ways. Additional identification attempts include CEO-firm and chair-firm fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel data estimations, and the use of the 2007 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, when fast decision making and managerial discretion were needed, the link between age dissimilarity and firm value changed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the influence of women on the boards of directors of National Health Service Foundation Trusts (FTs) in England. FTs provide a public service where social performance is the primary objective, although financial constraints must be met. Female presence (the proportion of women) is higher for executive directors than non-executives, reflecting the high number of women employed in the sector. We find that a high female presence among executive and non-executive directorships does not result in significant differences either in financial return or service quality. When gender diversity on boards is consistently high (high level of female presence across boards), the benefits on performance of having more women on the board may not be discernible. However, female Chairs or Chief Executives result in significant reductions in negative social outcomes, such as lower clinical negligence costs, without harming financial management. The findings of this study, carried out in a context of high female presence and where a woman frequently occupies one of the two most influential board positions, Chair and Chief Executive, have implications for gender diversity and gender targets on the boards of directors in business and other sectors.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

This paper investigates the association between a range of corporate governance mechanisms and forward-looking disclosure (FLD) in a low information environment: the Chinese stock markets. It finds that the implementation of certain monitoring and control mechanisms, such as financial expertise on audit committees and independent directors on the board of directors, can improve the extent of FLD. However, the size of the supervisory board and separating the roles of the CEO and the chairman of the board of directors is of little help in explaining any improvement in FLD. In contrast, ownership structure appears to play an essential role in determining FLD policies. Indeed, listed firms with high levels of foreign ownership and fewer pyramidal layers in their ownership structure tend to disclose more forward-looking information. Of particular interest, the association between state ownership and FLD is likely to be non-linear (an inverted U-shape), and the inflection point at which the association becomes negative occurs at a state ownership over 33 percent. In summary, this study provides new evidence on the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on FLD in China's unique institutional environment. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore how initial public offering (IPO) investors view female presence on boards of directors in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes hierarchical regression and analyzes data collected from firms undertaking their IPO's in the USA during 1997 and 2007. Findings - The findings of this study suggest that US IPO investors react negatively to female presence on the board of directors. However, this negative effect has weakened post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study may not generalize to other settings. Practical implications - Gender bias against females in the boardroom exists but appears to be weaker post-Sarbanes-Oxley. Social implications - One hurdle to greater female representation in entrepreneurial ventures in the USA may be weakening as a result of greater awareness of female director contributions to board functioning. Originality/value - First, the study represents one of the few attempts to examine the influence of female directors on organizational outcomes in IPO firms. Second, this study represents one of the first studies to consider the influence of director gender on IPO performance. Finally, this study extends extant research by examining investor reactions to female board presence. The results of this study suggest that bias against females in the boardroom may exist but appears to be weakening post-Sarbanes-Oxley. This finding indicates increasing awareness of female director contributions to board functioning on the part of IPO investors. (c) 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article presents a review of the studies on on boards of directors and corporate social responsibility practices in the banking industry. Several characteristics of bank boards, in particular independence and diversity, may impact their CSR commitments. By studying a sample of 159 banks in nine countries during the period 2004-2010, there is evidence that suggests that banks with more independent and diverse directors follow a path of socially responsible behaviour.

The objective of this paper is to obtain empirical evidence of the relationship between board structure, ownership composition, and the level of corporate governance transparency in the largest listed companies of Latin America. A correlational study was conducted with a longitudinal analysis using data from the largest listed comanies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010. The results show that the level of transparency is higher in companies with larger boards and with a higher percentage of independent directors. Meanwhile, the composition of ownership inhibits the level of transparency in corporate governance, while the presence of family shareholders encourages greater disclosure of corporate information.

We investigate the relationship between corporate board of directors' attributes and conditional accounting conservatism in the French context. Using a pooled regression model over the period 2009-2012, our empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, greater board activity encourages more conservative reporting in financial statements. Second, larger board size diminishes conditional accounting conservatism. Lastly, there is a positive association between gender diversity and accounting conservatism. As a robustness test, we use alternative measures of accounting conservatism, namely time series and accrual-based measures in addition to asymmetric timeliness of earnings. Our findings suggest that boards of directors' attributes are an important factor in determining the financial reporting quality of French firms. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute. All right reserved.

The CLO shapes and enforces corporate governance, but is faced with a dual-role paradox that requires her to act as both monitor of corporate governance and executive of the firm. We study the role of the CLO under environments that are most likely to impact governance and pressure the firm to either emphasize or marginalize the CLO's role as monitor or facilitator. Using the financial shock of a securities class action lawsuit on large corporations, we measure changes in CLO value through the metrics of total and relative compensation of the CLO and other C-suite members. After controlling for relevant variables such as growth and total assets, we find that when firms have more insiders on their board of directors, the CLO's compensation declines when the preceding year's Tobin's Q is high. CLO compensation increases under conditions of high opacity, but that compensation partially erodes in high Tobin's Q environments. We also find that a lawsuit increases CFO and CEO turnover but not the CLO's. Our results have implications for corporate governance, the dual and potentially conflicting role of CLO as gatekeeper and monitor, executive compensation, and agency costs. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Corporate governance significantly effects corporate performance and this relationship is established through number of studies theoretically and empirically conducted in this field. Also, there are studies which show the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital performance. Furthermore, intellectual capital performance positively effects corporate performance as shown in the previous studies. These relationships trigger this study to explore the role of intellectual capital as a mediator between corporate governance and corporate performance relationship. This study focuses on the idea that governance measures, board of directors in this study, can contribute to the intellectual capital efficiency of the companies which in turn results in higher corporate performance. A single structural model of corporate governance, intellectual capital and corporate performance is conceptualized. In the model, board of directors, variables are taken as governance measures, Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAICTM) as intellectual capital performance measure and traditional financial measures as corporate performance measures. It is intellectual capital resources which act as mechanism through which the corporate governance is able to influence the corporate performance. Intellectual capital is taken as mediator to confirm that IC properly mediates the CG and performance relationship conceptually. This study will be beneficial for the research community to combine different areas of study under one model. This study will suggest the management and other regulatory bodies to understand the importance of intellectual capital along with governance and performance.

This paper examines the demographic diversity at top-level management and its impact on firm performance. The paper focuses on Upper-echelon theory, which explains board characteristics and firm performance. Theoretical framework is specially designed using concepts, measures and models. Relevant hypotheses are developed to test diversity impact with the use of appropriate variables and measures. A total sample of large 60 top listed companies are considered based on their market capitalization. This empirical work uses BODs attributes and financial data, which are gathered over the period 2009 to 2013. This study incorporates econometrics methodology on panel data analysis, which is used rigorously for hypothesis testing. The results indicate that demographic diversity at board level does have a relationship with market value. (c) 2015 IEEE.

The objective of this article is twofold: identify the primary board characteristics that drive the quality of MFI governance and link governance quality to microfinance institutions' outreach performance. We measure governance quality with the governance rating score provided by Planet Rating, one of the agencies that specialize in the rating of microfinance institutions. The study focuses on an independently pooled cross-section sample of 178 MFIs rated by Planet Rating from 2001 to 2011. Findings obtained after controlling for selection bias suggest that board expertise, board activity, and ownership type are the main board characteristics that significantly determine the quality of MFI governance. Findings seem to be robust when we change the measurement of board size and ownership type. Moreover, MFIs with an effective governance system tend to serve large numbers of customers.

Since less than 20 percent of the seats on corporate boards in Germany are held by women, the German parliament passed a law recently that requires listed companies with employee representation on their supervisory boards to give 30 percent of the seats to women beginning in 2016. Based on findings in prior research on gender-based differences in a variety of decisions settings and the expansion of skills, experiences and perspectives by gender diversity, the authors hypothesize that firms with gender diversified boards will have higher quality of financial reporting. The empirical analysis covers the financial statements of 64 companies that were listed in DAX30, MDAX and SDAX from 2006 to 2011. In the analysis, two ex-post measures of earnings quality, the performance-matched discretionary accruals introduced by Kothari et al. (2005) and the modified Dechow/Dichev (2002) model as suggested in McNichols (2002), and two ex-ante measures of earnings management, Big4 auditor and financial leverage, are applied. The study shows that companies with gender diversified boards have lower absolute discretionary accruals. Additionally, the results indicate that firms with female head or deputy head of the supervisory board are following more conservative financial reporting rules and standards. Furthermore it can be shown, that the degree of external monitoring, measured by financial leverage, is higher for firms with female supervisory members. These findings suggest that the number and position of women at board-level have important implications for the quality of financial reporting. (c) Lena Panzer, Stefan Muller, 2015.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of political presence on profitability in Spanish savings banks. Together with political connections, the paper analyzes the effects of chairmen's banking experience on the efficiency of the savings banks. Design/methodology/approachInformation was collected from all the savings banks in the sample for the period 2002-2009. The database used combines time series with cross-section data to give a panel of data to be estimated with this methodology. FindingsAfter differentiating between municipal and regional participation, the results show that regional participation causes lower efficiency in a savings bank. There is no evidence that the financial experience of the chairman is an aspect that improves savings banks' profitability. Originality/valueThe analyses undertaken in this paper help to detect whether certain corporate governance practices affect stakeholders' interests and the economy as a whole, through their effects on economic and financial interests, like the efficiency of savings banks. The paper lends support to the recent legal reforms aimed at reducing political presence on the boards of savings banks. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This book develops a new framework - the stakeholder model - that helps to understand corporate finance and governance in modern society, where the sources of people's happiness have shifted from monetary to non-monetary factors. The book takes a more comprehensive approach than is typically found in the standard economics and finance literature, by explicitly incorporating both the monetary and non-monetary interests of stakeholders and by examining the value creation of corporations from a much broader perspective. Specifically, the book addresses contemporary issues concerning corporate finance and governance worldwide, including: How should we define corporate value in stakeholder society? What is the role of modern corporations? What are the principles underlying corporate financing decisions? To what extent should shareholder rights be enhanced? What determines the effectiveness of a company's board of directors? What missions do firms set out and what is the role of mission statements? How can we understand the diversity of financial and governance systems among different countries? What legal and institutional reforms enhance or diminish corporate value in stakeholder society? The book will answer these questions theoretically and empirically. (c) 2015 Shinichi Hirota. All rights reserved.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The role of corporate governance in financial institutions differs from that of non- financial institutions for the discretionary power of the board of directors would be limited especially in regulated financial systems where financial institutions are obliged to function through legislative and prescriptive procedures, policies, rules and regulations. This study, therefore, was aimed at examining the impact of corporate governance on the performance of closely regulated Ethiopian insurance Industry. The study employed explanatory research design with an econometric panel data of 10 Insurance companies that covers the period 2007 to 2014. Board size, board independence and board diversity have negative and insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies while size and independence of audit committee and frequency of board meetings have positive but insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies in Ethiopia. Thus it could be concluded that all corporate governance mechanisms have insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies measured by return on asset. This vividly affirms that the role of board of directors in closely regulated financial sector is dismal and insignificant for they have limited discretionary power to exercise as board of directors. Thus it would be recommendable if the regulatory body could relax its prescriptive and stringent policies and devolve its power to board of directors without endangering the viability of insurance companies.

This research examines the relationship between the board of directors and firm's performance through the R&D investment-level in the French context from perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to identify if the R&D investment-level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the board size, and secondly, the performance. The empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationship between boards composition linked variables and the firm performance are meditated by the firm R&D investment-level.

The gender composition of the board of directors can affect the quality of its monitoring role and thus the financial performance of the firm. The relationship between female representation and firms' performance represents a crucial issue in the debate on the effects of board gender quotas. The evidence on this relationship is mixed. Many studies analyze whether female top executives and women on boards of directors have a significant effect on firm performance. Many governments have introduced regulations regarding the gender composition of the boards of directors of private firms in order to improve equality of opportunity. This study examines the relationship between management diversity and firm performance for the 180 companies listed during 2008 - 2014. No evidence suggests that regulatory measures, on average, improve firm performance. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Purpose - Directors play a hard-to-quantify but critical role in the success of corporations. Outside directors supplement the firm-specific knowledge of inside directors by providing expertise and monitoring. Prior research finds that outside directors who are commercial bankers can be both beneficial and costly to large, non-financial corporations. Smaller, bank-dependent corporations should benefit more than large firms from the services banker directors provide, but may also be more prone to the costs they can impose. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of bank dependency on appointments of banker directors. Design/methodology/approach - The author estimates models relating the probability of a first-time banker-director appointment to proxies of bank dependency on data for a matched sample of firms with and without banker directors drawn from a size-representative sample of Compustat firms. Findings - Bank-dependent firms are less likely to appoint bankers as directors than bank-independent firms. Bank-dependent firms are also less likely to appoint bankers whose employers are firms' creditors (i.e. affiliated bankers). Bank-dependent and bank-independent firms are indistinguishable in their probabilities of appointing unaffiliated bankers as directors. Practical implications - Bank-dependent firms with unexploited growth opportunities appear unable to ameliorate their financial constraints by having banker directors. Appointing retired bankers to boards may give firms the benefits of banker directors without the costs. Originality/value - This paper is the first to: document the prevalence of banker directors at smaller corporations; present econometric evidence on banker-director appointments at firms ranging from small to large; and identify bank dependency as a factor limiting appointments of affiliated banker directors.

This paper gives the empirical analysis of the impact of the boards of directors' composition and structure and the personal characteristics of the boards' members on corporate performance of Russian public and non-public companies. Hypothesis that describe the influence of the boards' characteristics on corporate performance are tested on the panel data of 200 Russian large and medium joint-stock companies during the period between 2007-2011. As a result, we show that firms' efficiency depends on a number of the boards' characteristics (the share of the executive directors, the number of directors with the working experience in the industry, chairman working in the boards of other companies).

Previous studies that have examined the impact of board diversity on firm financial performance have yielded conflicting results. One of the main challenges for studies looking at the impact of diverse directors stems from the fact that firm financial performance and board of director composition may be endogenously determined. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to the problem of endogeneity. By analyzing the reaction of the stock market when a diverse director's departure is announced, we can examine investors' perceptions of the importance of changes in board diversity. Our results show that investors value gender diversity among directors; however, we are unable to conclude that investors value ethnic diversity among directors.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

We investigate the relationship between boardroom gender diversity and firm risk. To identify a causal effect of gender on risk, we use a dynamic model that controls for reverse causality and for gender and risk being influenced by unobservable firm factors. We find no evidence that female boardroom representation influences equity risk. We also show that findings of a negative relationship between the two variables are spurious and driven by unobserved between-firm heterogeneous factors. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

In this paper, we draw on insights from theories in the management and corporate governance literature to develop a theoretical model that makes explicit the links between a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) related board attributes, its board CSR strategy, and its environmental and social performance. We then test the model using structural equation modeling approach. We find that the greater the CSR orientation of the board (as measured by the board's independence, gender diversity, and financial expertise on audit committee), the more proactive and comprehensive the firm's CSR strategy, and the higher its environmental and social performance. Moreover, we find this link to be endogenous and self-reinforcing, with superior CSR performers tending to further strengthen their board CSR orientation. This result while positive is also suggestive of the widening of the gap between the leads and laggards in CSR. Therefore, the question arises as to how 'leaders' are using their superior CSR competencies seen by many scholars as a source of corporate (at times unfair) competitive advantage. Stakeholders of corporations therefore need to be cognizant of this aspect of CSR when evaluating a firm's CSR activities. Policy makers also need to be cognizant of these concerns when designing regulation in this field. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

In this study, we investigate the impact women leaders have on the corporate environmental strategies of organizations. Using a dataset of all Fortune 500 CEOs and boards of directors for a ten-year period, we examine several aspects of gender in leadership on environmental strategy. Specifically, we test the impact of women CEOs, the proportion of women on the BOD, the number of interlinks women board members hold, and the interactive and cumulative effects of women CEOs and gender diverse boards. Findings suggest that firms characterized by gender diverse leadership teams are more effective than other firms at pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. This study contributes to research on corporate governance and environmental performance by showing how the gender composition of leaders affects corporate practice.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

Can female directors help save economies and the firms on whose boards they sit? Policy-makers seem to think so. Numerous countries have implemented boardroom gender policies because of business case arguments. While women may be the key to healthy economies, I argue that more research needs to be done to understand the benefits of board diversity. The literature faces three main challenges: data limitations, selection and causal inference. Recognizing and dealing with these challenges is important for developing informed research and policy. Negative stereotypes may be one reason women are underrepresented in management. It is not clear that promoting them on the basis of positive stereotypes does them, or society, a service.

Purpose-This paper aims to examine the relationship between corporate governance, in particular board diversity, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting among the top 150 listed companies in Australia over a three-year period. Design/methodology/approach-The quantitative analysis involving a longitudinal study is used where content analysis is undertaken to analyse the extent of CSR disclosures in annual reports. Regression analysis using panel data is used to analyse the potential association between CSR disclosure and five important board diversity measures, specifically independence, tenure, gender, multiple directorships and overall diversity measure. Findings-The results based on the regression analysis reveal that three of the board diversity attributes (gender, tenure and multiple directorships) and the overall diversity measure have the potential to influence CSR reporting. The relationship between independent/non-executive directors and CSR disclosure however is unclear. In addition, three of the control variables (firm size, industry and CEO duality) are found to have some influence on CSR disclosure, whereas board size and profitability are found to be insignificant. The results also indicate the existence of some possible interaction effects between gender and multiple directorships. Originality/value-The paper has implications for companies, for policymakers and for the professional development needs of board members. Australian companies should consider identifying board attributes that enhance CSR disclosures, as it has been shown in previous studies that CSR disclosure in Australia is low when compared to other developed countries. Moreover, given that there is such limited research linking board diversity and CSR disclosure, the results of this paper provide scope for further research. Moreover the paper contributes to the existing literature on board composition and CSR disclosure by extending the literature to board diversity and provides preliminary evidence of the influence of board diversity on CSR disclosure in Australia.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between gender and environmental sustainability. Based on a sample of 296 firms, drawn from the population of US publicly traded firms over a five-year period, we empirically test whether firms that have (1) more gender diverse boards of directors and (2) more policies and practices that enable or reinforce gender diversity throughout the organization, adopted more environmentally responsible policies and practices. We find that both 'demographic' and 'structural' gender diversity are significant predictors of a firm's environmental sustainability initiatives. Our findings show gender diversity is a sustainability issue as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: This study aims to include two primary goals. First to determine the board characteristics of listed companies in Turkey and second to investigate the effect of board gender diversity on the performance of these companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an instrumental variables regression analysis to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance using the data from 2008-2012 of the entities listed on the Borsa Istanbul. Findings: The results indicate that the boards of these companies in Turkey are male-dominated. Moreover, this study shows that the inclusion of female directors is positively related to the financial performance of firms, as measured by the return on assets, the return on equity and the return on sales. Originality/value: Limited empirical studies have been conducted on the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance in emerging economies. Therefore, there is still no consensus regarding the link between board gender diversity and firm financial performance based upon the mixed and sometimes contradictory results in prior research. Therefore, this study extends the current literature in the context of Turkey, showing that a female member on the board can enhance the financial performance of a company.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript type: Review Research Question/Issue: Bank governance has become the focus of a flurry of recent research and heated policy debates. However, the literature presents seemingly conflicting evidence on the implications of governance for bank risk-taking. The purpose of this paper is to review prior work and propose directions for future research on the role of governance on bank stability. Research Findings/Insights: We highlight a number of key governance devices and how these shape bank risk-taking: the effectiveness of bank boards, the structure of CEO compensation, and the risk management systems and practices employed by banks. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Prior work primarily views bank governance as a mechanism to protect the interests of bank shareholders only. However, given that taxpayer-funded guarantees protect a substantial share of banks' liabilities and that banks are highly leveraged, shareholder-focused governance may well subordinate the interests of other stakeholders and exacerbate risk-taking concerns in the banking industry. Our review highlights the need for internal governance mechanisms to mitigate such behavior by reflecting the needs of shareholders, creditors, and the taxpayer. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review argues that the relationship between governance and risk is central from a financial stability perspective. Future research on issues highlighted in the review offer a footing for reforming bank governance to constrain potentially undesirable risk-taking by banks. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of corporate governance quality on earnings management in Jordan. Using a panel data set of all industrial and service firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) during the period 2009-2013; this paper provides evidence that earnings management is affected negatively by corporate governance quality. In particular; the results show that earnings management is affected negatively by overall categories of governance index represented by board of director, board meeting, Audit and nomination and compensation committee. Furthermore, results suggest that corporate governance quality has increased over time. Thus, its ability to constrain earnings management has also increased. It is recommended to industrial and service companies to boost their compliance with corporate governance code to improve the integrity and reliability of financial reports. This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance quality on earnings management in Jordan as an emerging economy.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines a sample of 341 corporations that were ranked in the Fortune 500 in all seven years from 2006 through 2012. We compiled data from multiple corporate recognition lists including the following: the Most Admired Companies, the Most Ethical Companies, the Best Companies to Work for, and the Best Corporate Citizens. Our findings indicate that the higher the percentage of women on a company's board of directors, the more likely the company is to appear on these lists. We also found that the average percentage of women directors for the listed companies was significantly higher than the average percentage of women directors for the companies that did not appear on any of these lists over the period from 2006 through 2012.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and mandatory disclosure compliance (measured by International Financial Reporting Standards requirements) in firms listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) in 2010. Design/methodology/approach: Several characteristics are used to assess the effectiveness of the board of directors: number of members, gender diversity, CEO duality, multiple directorships, the proportion of family members on the board and the presence of a member of the ruling family of Kuwait. Mandatory disclosure compliance is measured using a self-constructed, item-based index. A regression model tested the paper's hypotheses. Findings: After controlling for firm-specific characteristics, it was found that board size, gender diversity and multiple directorships were positively correlated with compliance, while CEO duality and the proportion of family members on the board were negatively correlated with compliance. Research limitations/implications: Potential limitations stem from both the nature of the sample and the dataset. The small sample reflects the size of the KSE and the limited timeframe (a one-year period). Nevertheless, this paper provides some interesting insights. A longitudinal study would provide more comprehensive insights into the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and mandatory disclosure compliance over time. Practical implications: The findings highlight the effectiveness of board of directors' characteristics in promoting mandatory accounting compliance. As disclosure is fundamental for the effective functioning of capital markets and sound investments, a direct implication is that the quality of financial reporting can be improved by taking these characteristics into account. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of mandatory accounting compliance. The findings highlight the importance of the board of directors' role in enhancing transparency and ensuring the quality of financial reporting. The findings will be particularly valuable to those involved in the appointment of directors, who should be aware of the influence of the configuration and characteristics of the board on compliance.

In this article, we aim to study the impact on dividends policy of gender diversity on the board of directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

We investigate the role of gender diversity on corporate boards in mitigating internal control weaknesses (ICWs). We predict and find that firms with greater female board representation are less likely to have ICWs. The results are not driven by females sitting on the audit committee. Instead, it appears that females on corporate boards reduce ICWs, regardless of whether they sit on the audit committee or not. Our results are inconsistent with the critical mass theory, showing that even one female board member could reduce the likelihood of ICWs. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with female board members' typical characteristic tendency shown in prior literature (e.g., being more likely to discuss difficult issues, more fiscally conservative, better monitors, and less tolerant of opportunistic behaviors). Our results have implications for board member selection from a policy perspective as well as board member monitoring from an investor and regulator perspective. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of women on the board of directors on corporate tax avoidance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use multivariate regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female directors on the board and tax aggressiveness. They also test for self-selection bias in the regression model by using the two-stage Heckman procedure. Findings - This paper finds that relative to there being one female board member, high (i.e. greater than one member) female presence on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias and using several alternative measures of tax aggressiveness. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the extant literature on corporate governance and tax aggressiveness. This study is subject to several caveats. First, the sample is restricted to publicly listed Australian firms. Second, this study only examines the issue of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness in the context of Australia. Practical implications - This research is timely, as there has been increased pressure by government bodies in Australia and globally to develop policies to increase female representation on the board of directors. Originality/value - This study is the first to provide empirical evidence concerning the association between the presence of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

This study examines the remuneration of non-executive directors, examining individual monitoring characteristics and director capital in addition to firm characteristics. Using a large sample of FTSE All-Share non-executive directors from 2001 to 2012, we find that remuneration is positively linked to both directors' individual characteristics and firm characteristics. We find that director age, tenure, and network size are positively related to remuneration, suggesting that directors' ability to contribute to board decision-making and their set of resources are valued by firms. We find that director remuneration is negatively related to monitoring characteristics such as director independence, suggesting possible agency considerations, as effective monitors of top management are paid less. However, director ownership has a non-linear relationship with remuneration, and is substitutive at higher levels of ownership. We also observe that UK boards are relatively homogeneous, with few female directors and even fewer Chairmen, and find strong evidence of a gender gap in remuneration when examining inter- and intra-firm variations. Our findings have implications for regulators who seek to intervene in board appointments, as they indicate that firms do not necessarily value or reward resources brought by female or independent directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on the participation of women on Boards of Directors (BD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a body of literature (theoretical and empirical words) that analyzes the women's role on the BD of companies. The review allows the authors to bring together the theoretical foundations and the empirical findings of studies that have examined the influence of the engagement of women on BD on the business outcomes of the firms involved. Findings - There is no agreement on the results relating to the effect of the presence of women on these boards. Moreover, there is no well-defined theoretical basis to explain this relationship, making it necessary to use a multi-theoretical approach. Research limitations/implications - This study could be extended by including investigations of the intermediate variable between the composition of the BD and the business outcomes, thus enabling an analysis of the effects of different organizational variables on the economic and financial variables already studied. In addition, the authors propose a comparative study between different countries and between different kinds of companies. Originality/value - This paper highlights the controversy that exists over the significance of the involvement of women on the BD of companies. It also proposes the development of new lines of research to attempt to answer some of the questions that are raised by the diverse findings reported in the literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

We test whether proxies for elements of the fraud triangle are related to fraudulent corporate behavior. We use Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases from 2003 through 2010 to form a sample of 103 firms with violations and compare their characteristics to a matched sample of control firms. We find significant explanatory variables representing all three sides of the fraud triangle including opportunity, pressure and rationalization. SEC violations are more likely when the board of directors has fewer women, longer tenure, more insiders, and the CEO is also the chairperson. Fraud is also more likely when managers and directors are compensated with stock options and when there has been a recent auditor change.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper was first to find out whether the negative relationship between board size and future firm risk persists in China while contemplating all sorts of endogeneity. Second, the authors have investigated the role of large shareholders in influencing the managerial decisions concerning future firm risk via board size. Finally, the authors examined whether the moderating role of large shareholders is any different in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) in China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample included all the A-listed firms listed on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen stock exchanges over a sample period from 2008 to 2013. The authors used fixed effects regression and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size is negatively associated with future firm risk when measured as volatility in future stock prices and future cash flows. Second, large shareholders directly influence managerial decisions about future firm risk, irrespective of board size. Third, the moderating role of ownership concentration is insignificant in both SOEs and NSOEs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which has analyzed the role of large shareholders in the relationship between board size and future firm risk. This study provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of a developing country, into the role played by large shareholders in influencing managerial decisions concerning future firm risk.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

The impact of board diversity, in terms of gender, race, ethnicity etc., on performance and stability of firms has been researched extensively. However, the impact of religious diversity and its impact on performance and stability has been completely ignored. This issue is quite relevant, especially for the Islamic banks because of their primary objective i.e. to be in compliant with Islamic principles in all their dealings. Taking a cue from this argument, we believe if the majority board members are Muslim it can have a positive impact on the performance as they would better understand the importance of the substance of the shari'ah compliant dealings and that can translate into good performance and make it more stable. Based on our arguments, we examined the impact of religious diversity on the performance and stability on Malaysian banks Islamic and Conventional both for the period of 9 years, through 2005 to 2013. Our results from GMM estimation reveal that the religious orientation has no impact on the performance and this result is robust to various proxies. Our results imply that a non-Muslim member of the board of directors is able to run the Islamic banking business as good as a Muslim board member. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript type: Review Research Question/Issue: This article reviews how and through which channels corporate governance shapes takeover outcomes. Research Findings: We summarize the main findings of the empirical literature that investigates the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on takeover outcomes. The internal and external governance mechanisms that we consider are: the board of directors, the takeover market, blockholders, financial markets in general, product market competition, and the labor market. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This article adopts an agency perspective of the firm and reviews the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) literature through the lens of corporate governance. We highlight how the different corporate governance mechanisms affect the takeover process and outcomes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The article systematizes the current state of the research linking corporate governance and takeovers. In doing so, we emphasize which mechanisms policymakers can use to improve the efficiency of the takeover market. Alternatively, the review also offers indications concerning mechanisms that could be used to mitigate agency conflicts and, as such, increase firm value. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Corporate governance issues are critical in university spin-offs because, since their substantially knowledge and technology-driven nature, investments are characterized by rapid growth and real investment opportunities, affecting innovative activity too. In this view, the paper investigate the role of the board of directors' composition on innovation performance of university spin-offs. Based on a panel sample of 478 Italian university spin-offs, the results show that board size has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with innovation, remarking that not too large boards are more efficient and work better, influencing in a positive way the innovation activity of the spin-off. Regarding the impact of the outside directors, the results seems to invalidate its positive and significant effect on innovation performance. Also the CEO-duality seems to have no influence on the innovative activity. These findings may represent potential indicators of the optimal configuration for board in university spin-offs in order to improve innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the directors' socioeconomic backgrounds on the risk-taking behavior of the listed commercial banks in China. Design/methodology/approach: The generalized least square method and Arellano and Bover's (1995) generalized method of moment were used to study the relationship between the directors' socioeconomic backgrounds and bank risk-taking behavior. The sample studied consists of 16 listed commercial banks in China from 2003 to 2011. Findings: It was found that smaller board sizes and higher percentage of independent directors contribute to lower risk-taking. The results also indicate that banks are better off with boards that have gender diversity, government affiliation and higher average age because they enhance problem-solving and market insights facilitate adherence to government or regulatory policies and help reduce the banks' risks. Research limitations/implications: Future studies may consider including non-public-listed banks, pre-2003 data and analyses of the agencies to which the government-affiliated directors are or were attached. Practical implications: The paper suggests that corporate governance reform initiatives with closely monitored implementation and phased liberalization contributed toward the banking industry's resilience. Implications for management include that boards of directors with better quality, sufficient independence, gender diversity, government affiliation and maturity will help reduce risks. Social implications: This study may facilitate the decision-making for the bank management and policymakers on the selection of best directors in the Chinese banking sector. The Chinese banking system serves as a plausible role model for consideration, given that four of its banks have now leapfrogged to be among the top ten largest banking institutions after the global financial crisis. Originality/value: The study covers a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds of the board of directors which are crucial in influencing the behavior of the board in banking operations.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the negative relationship between board size and corporate risk taking in a unique market and institutional environment of China. The authors used a comprehensive sample of 1,502 Chinese listed firms, over a sample period of 2008 to 2013. Empirical findings show that despite the uniqueness of Chinese corporate governance features, board size is negatively associated with corporate risk taking. However, the economic impact of change in board size is much smaller than other developed market context, highlighting the exclusive features of Chinese boards and market. (c) 2016 Taylor & Francis.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the effect, if any, of family ownership and busy boards on companies' Tobin's Q and cash holdings in France. Design/methodology/approach - Using a multiple regression analysis for panel data, the author investigate the impacts of being family-owned and of multiple directorships on cash holdings and then on Tobin's. Findings - Family ownership seems to have no significant effect. The most significant finding is that family-owned companies are smaller and work in the manufacturing and construction sectors compared to non-family-owned companies. However, multiple directorship is not negatively related to firm performance in France. Research limitations/implications - The current study focusses solely on France, which, even though different from the more usual American perspective, is not enough to make broad generalizations. It is however, a useful step toward better understanding the issues at hand. International data on family firms and busy boards, while hard to come by, would further enhance the knowledge of corporate governance. Originality/value - It is interesting to know if family-owned companies and those with multiple directorships perform differently from others, especially in a context where organizations can choose between a one-tier or two-tier system of governance, as is the case in France.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the effect of boards of directors' characteristics on the use of private information in executive compensation. Research Findings/Insights: We predict and find that boards' competence both in information acquisition and in monitoring influences the extent to which boards use private performance measures in CEO compensation. Specifically, smaller and more independent boards with their CEOs as the board chair are found to rely more heavily on private performance measures. The documented effects of board characteristics disappear after the passage of SOX, likely due to the homogenized composition of boards and compensation committees brought by the legislated changes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper extends the literature on the board's role in executive compensation. Although prior evidence is abundant on how boards affect the alignment of CEO compensation with public performance measures, little is known about boards' use of private information to compensate CEOs. It also extends the literature on the role of corporate boards by examining both their monitoring and information roles. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to regulators regarding the role of boards of directors in monitoring and their role in private information acquisition. It highlights the importance of considering the tradeoff between these two roles when regulating corporate governance rules. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate board director disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to check whether gender diversity, education, independence and size of the board of directors affect measures of corporate value creation. Findings: The empirical results show that corporate value creation is positively influenced by the cross effect of the board independence and the presence of women. They also point out a positive impact of the cross effect of board independence and management education. They reveal that the board of directors contributes significantly to corporate value creation, particularly when there is a mix of independent, female and management-qualified directors. Originality/value: The evidence presented and discussed in this paper should be of interest to managers and regulators. The methodological approach and the empirical results extend the existing literature. They enrich the limited empirical research devoted to this theme, especially in a continental European context, i.e. France. They shed light on the effect of board of directors' disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study whether and how owners' preferences for CEO characteristics changed due to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The authors identify three fundamental success factors needed for companies to compete in the after-crisis environment, and the authors connect five CEO characteristics to such factors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors rely on a hand-collected database to build a panel data of European CEOs for the 2010-2012 period. Findings - The empirical results indicate that after 2009, CEOs of companies that were more severely hit by the crisis are significantly different compared to those of other companies. More specifically, they have a background in science or engineering; they have international experience; and they are remunerated to a higher extent through stock options. The results of this paper also indicate that only international experience had a positive and significant impact on financial performance. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the stream of literature on CEO characteristics and owners' identity, tackling the research theme from a dynamic rather than from a static perspective.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

There remain open questions regarding whether board of director ethnic and gender diversity increases or decreases firm value. Additionally, prior research has yet to examine the value effects of a diverse board in the presence of a gender/ethnic minority CEO. Using the KLD social ratings database, we examine 13 000 firm-years and provide robust evidence that board diversity increases firm value. However, we also show that any value added via board diversity is nullified when a diverse board operates in the presence of a female and/or minority CEO. Results suggest that a significant portion of the value in board diversity may come from gender/ethnic differences between the board members and the CEO. One implication of our study is that when hiring a CEO or electing directors relative gender/ethnic make-up is important. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

This article uses a survey of Australian corporate treasurers to shed light on the gap between the theory and practice of corporate finance in Australia. Seven areas are examined: capital structure, payout policy, cash holdings, initial public offerings, seasoned equity offering, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. We also exploit the global financial crisis (GFC) to examine the effect of liquidity shocks on a firm's capital structure choices. We then compare our Australian survey results with results from a comprehensive US survey conducted by Graham and Harvey. Our survey shows that the board of directors plays the most important role in determining capital structure decisions and that corporate treasurers play the most important role in cash holding decisions. This contrasts with the academic literature that has typically focused on the role of chief executive officer (CEO) in both capital structure and cash holding decisions. In addition, our respondents do not view the tax advantage of interest deductibility to be of first order of importance for debt issuance choices, which contrasts with most of the US empirical studies. Finally, we juxtapose the theory-practice perspective, with a review of the most recent 5 years (2011-2015) of corporate finance research published in the leading Asia Pacific Basin finance journals.

We examine the relationship between the board of directors and earnings persistence. We define the advisory role of board members as providing strategic counsel to top management. We argue that strategic counseling provided by the board helps create and sustain growth, which, in turn, translates into more persistent earnings. We find that for firms whose boards are dedicated to advising, earnings are more persistent and the association between earnings and future cash flows is higher, compared with firms whose boards are not focused on advising. We further find that advising by boards increases the persistence of both the cash flows component and the accruals component of current earnings. In additional analyses, we fail to find a consistently positive correlation between boards with intensive monitoring and more persistent earnings. Putting together, these results suggest that the relation between board structure and earnings persistence is more likely driven by the advisory role and less likely by the monitoring function of the board of directors.

We estimate a hazard model of the probability of top corporate executives exiting their firms over the period 1996-2010. Our main findings are that: (1) female executives have greater likelihoods of exit than males, (2) the likelihood of exit increases with the independence of the board and decreases with the fraction of the board that is female and the average age of board members, and (3) a higher percentage of independent directors on the board lowers the probability of exit more for females than for males. Further, controlling for exit risk reduces the well-documented compensation differential between men and women. (c) 2016 The Eastern Finance Association

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

The impact of boardroom diversity on firm financial performance has attracted growing research interest in recent years. However, due to the lack of readily available datasets for other parts of the world, most of the evidence is based on the US data. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between gender diversity in the boardrooms and firm financial performance in a region, where it has never been studied before. Using a sample of 60 firms listed in Abu Dhabi and Dubai Stock Exchanges, first the impact of gender diverse boards on the accounting value of the firms is analyzed. Afterwards, stock price reactions to the announcement of the gender quotas on corporate boards in the UAE are examined. The results do not show a significant impact of female directors on the firm's both accounting and market value. However, these results should be interpreted carefully since the presence of women in leading positions might affect different aspects of the firm practices. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress.

This paper examines compensation to the boards of directors and supervisors for a sample of 656 firms over the period 1999-2008. I find in Taiwan that about 53.21% of firms pay excess compensation to their boards and 13.72% of the boards are overpaid by more than 50%. This paper conjectures that firms reward directors and supervisors in order to retain their valuable human capital and notes a robust positive effect of excess compensation on future firm performance. Because directors and supervisors are rewarded for future success, their excess pay may not be considered all that bad. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This article aims at assessing the influence of women in the board of directors (BOD) on risk management in Vietnamese firms. The study touches upon a sample of 284 companies listed on the HOSE (Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange - Vietnam) in the period of 2008-2014. Their data was regressed by the random effects model (REM) and the fixed effects model (FEM). To find out which method is the most appropriate, we used the Hausman test. The study clarifies women's role in society and the optimal ratio of women in the BOD to minimise risks at enterprises. The authors give recommendations to corporate managers regarding proper employment policies, in which the role of women is better recognised. The most valuable result of the presented research is a grounded finding of an optimal female ratio in the BOD recommended for the Vietnamese enterprises. In order to achieve a positive impact of women on the risks reduction at the enterprise, the suggested female ratio in the BOD should be 34.96%, which will help to keep the lowest risk exposure. Hence, it could be recommended to raise a number of women in the BODs to approximately 1/3 of the total amount of members. Business owners may take this into account when planning human resource policies to maximise business performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Society Transformation.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

The worldwide business practices bring more attention to corporate governance. Board of directors (BOD) is also assumed as the central mechanism of corporate governance. However, whether the board composition will influence firm profitability is still questionable. This paper investigates the effect of the size of BOD and magnitude of executive directors on the firm profitability. Based on generalized methods of moments regressions on a sample of 267 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia during 2010-2013, it is found that the board size and executive ratio have a positive impact on the firm profitability, although the coefficient value of the executive ratio considerably is greater than the coefficient of the board size. Moreover, persistent profitability is remarked by both models|. The age of the firm factor has an insignificant relationship with firm profitability. However, leverage has a negative significant influence on the firm profitability, but the effect of liquidity on profitability is positive. (c) 2016, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

The recent restructuring of the economy has led to the fact that the leaders of information technology sector - Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon - became the largest companies in the world, replacing the banking and oil and gas sectors. The emergence of a large number of technology start-ups resulted in the increase of the entrepreneurial ownership. Business founders tend to issue dual class stocks to retain control over key corporate decisions. The capital structure and the Board of Directors structure alter along with changes in the ownership structure. In many large companies, more than 90% of directors have become independent. At the same time, the diversification of the board of directors is improving by the active involvement of women in decisionmaking processes. Zero debt popularity reflect the changes in the attitude to risk. The article examines the main trends in the ownership structure of the largest US companies. The research consolidates the results of theoretical and empirical research in the field of corporate governance, capital structure and ownership structure in the developed markets. We provide the analysis of the dispersed ownership as the element of Anglo- Saxon corporate governance model based on historical trends in the ownership structure of companies in the US. The appearance of new sectors, the rapid development of entrepreneurial ownership, the return of the popularity of dual class shares, the fashion for gender diversification in the board of directors and the phenomenon of zero debt level are illustrated by case studies of actual corporations and analytical reports. We discuss all of the identified trends in terms of risk. In order to hedge the higher business risks of new sectors the top management and investors reduce debt, invite women to the board of directors and increase the degree of independence of the board of directors.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates whether or not bank risk-taking behaviors are affected by boards of directors in Japanese banks. After financial deregulation, the Japanese banking industry entered a series of M&A booms. Expansion of Japanese banks is expected to be a driver of their risk taking. Furthermore, these M&A booms are expected to affect board size and board composition of the Japanese banks. Nevertheless, few studies describe or analyze the relation between these changes of board of directors in Japanese banks and their respective risk taking behaviors. As described herein, we analyze boards of directors effects on risk taking in the Japanese banking industry during 2006-2014. Our empirical findings are the following points. First, we find that board size is negatively correlated with bank risk, which implies that smaller boards might expand risk taking because they more completely reflect bank shareholders interests. Second, the outside director ratio is not significantly related to bank risk taking, which might be due to the fewer outside directors of Japanese banks. These results are robust after controlling for endogeneity problems. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Corporate governance has becoming a vital issue which tremendously researched even in a small organization such as cooperative. However, none has studied in the context of Malaysian budget hotel and accommodation cooperatives. This study investigated 56 Board of Directors' perceptions to find out their awareness of the corporate governance and the existing guidelines in their cooperatives. The study also examined their perceptions toward nine aspects of corporate governance such as management, appointment, responsibilities and accountability, information, assessment, remuneration, auditing and control, communication and finally principles and values. The findings highlighted that board of Directors aware of the corporate governance practice and the existing guidelines. Further, the findings also indicated positive perceptions regarding the practice which significantly contributes to the management of budget hotel and accommodation cooperatives to sustain the economy and community wealth.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the empirical link between corporate governance and financial performance on a sample of 51 companies mostly from the technology sector and NASDAQ listed, during 2010-2013. Performance was measured using as proxy the return on assets (ROA) and the return on equity (ROE) and for the corporate governance measures there were selected variables as duality, seniority and remuneration of the CEO, size, independence and gender diversity related to Boards of Directors. As estimation techniques we used multivariate regression models, generalized least squares (GLS) and standard error correction for heteroskedasticity using White's method. The empirical results have confirmed the influence of mixed corporate governance variables on financial performance indicators at the company level. Hence, we obtained in both models a positive influence on financial performance from variables age, years listing and CEO's remuneration with bonuses. We obtained negative influence for the variables size / independent members of the Board of Directors and for the CEO duality. The difference between the two models was marked by the positive influence of the percentage of womens in Board of Directors' members and the CEO salary on ROA. The control variables had a positive influence only on the ROE model. The Risk Commitee variable had a negative influence on ROE. The paper highlights issues related to human nature such as the lack of fear for penalty which can lead to the loss of use of rationality and morality, a fact which leads to dangerous behavior if that people have a significant decision-making power.

The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of the reality of women on the Boards of Directors of Brazilian companies. Based on the Human Capital Theory, we have analyzed the characteristics of education and professional experience of Brazilian female board members, as well as the gender composition of 410 publicly traded companies listed with BM&FBovespa, in 2011. Our results indicate that only 7.3 % of the BD seats in the companies sampled were occupied by women, indicating inequality of opportunities for women in the BDs of these companies. The study also showed that the main reason for female nominations to Brazilian BDs was not necessarily investments in human capital, but family ties with company owners, which was the case of 40 % of the women surveyed.

Much research has suggested that independent boards of directors are more effective in reducing agency costs and improving firm governance. How they influence innovation is less clear. Relying on regulatory changes, we show that firms that transition to independent boards focus on more crowded and familiar areas of technology. They patent and claim more and receive more total future citations to their patents. However, the citation increase comes mainly from incremental patents in the middle of the citation distribution; the numbers of uncited and highly cited patents--arguably associated with riskier innovation strategies--do not change significantly.

This paper investigates whether female independent directors are more likely to impose high dividend payouts. We find evidence that firms with a larger fraction of female directors on their board have greater dividend payouts. This finding is robust to alternative econometric specifications, and alternative measures of dividend payouts and female board representation. The positive effect of board gender composition on dividends remains when we employ propensity score matching, the instrumental variable approach, and difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that board gender composition significantly increases the dividend payout only for firms with weak governance, suggesting that female directors use dividend payouts as a governance device.

Purpose: This study is guided by the upper echelon theory and argues that the role of females on boards of directors may differ between cultures. In a culture where the community has a significant humane orientation, female directors may pay much more attention to the social issues of corporate sustainability rather than environmental issues. Therefore, this study aims to differentiate between the social and environmental performances of companies to examine whether the presence of females on the boards of directors of Malaysian firms could affect social and environmental performances differently. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of firms listed in Bursa Malaysia and develops two disclosure indices to measure social and environmental performances. Three proxies of female directors are used in the empirical models. The ordinary least square model is used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The empirical results suggest a positive association between social performance and the presence of female directors on the board of directors of Malaysian firms. However, no association was found between environmental performance and the presence of female directors on those boards. These results confirm the prediction of this study that the female directors of Malaysian firms pay more attention to social issues than to environmental ones. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the effects of the presence of female directors on Malaysian firms' boards of directors on social and environmental performance. It also contributes to the upper echelon theory by illuminating the importance of gender diversity in influencing the social and environmental behaviors of corporate leaders. The results provide the important implication that the association between a firm's social and environmental performance and gender diversity depends on the culture within which the company operates.

In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks' vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in Italy, where the recently enforced Law 120/2011 prescribes gender quotas for boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity-firm financial performance relationship in an unbalanced panel of 918 Italian listed companies during the years 2011-2014. Findings: Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin's Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that board gender diversity is not a simple "numbers game", greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards and Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors. Originality/value: Most articles on this topic use data from countries with a legal system based on common law; this paper analyses Italy, a country with a civil law system. This is almost certainly the first study to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in the Italian market. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the impact of board of director gender diversity on corporate tax aggressiveness. Based on a sample of 418 U.S. firms covering the 2006-2009 period (1672 firm-year observations), our ordinary least squares regression results show a negative and statistically significant association between female representation on the board and tax aggressiveness after controlling for endogeneity. Our results are consistent across several measures of tax aggressiveness and additional robustness checks. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether gender diversity on board and financial expertise on audit committee affect accounting conservatism in banking sector. Additionally, the authors focus on the effects of board characteristics on bank earnings quality and examine their effects on earnings persistence. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a large sample of 159 banks from nine different countries from the period 2004-2010. The authors study whether the differences in the timeliness of earnings to bad news and earnings quality across governance structures of banks are driven by differences across investor protection and bank regulation levels in banks. Findings: The findings confirm the monitoring role of both female and financial experts, noting a positive effect of them on accounting conservatism and earnings quality in banks. According to the institutional characteristics, the results suggest the complementary role of banking regulation and investor protection levels in these effects, noting that in contexts of higher regulatory and greater investor protection environments, gender diversity and financial expertise on boards have more influence on the conservatism and earnings quality of banks. Originality/value: The authors contribute to both the accounting quality literature and the corporate governance literature by identifying board characteristics that are associated with higher conservatism and quality of earnings in banks around the world. In addition, this study also contributes to the ethics literature by highlighting the benefits of gender diversity and financial expertise in upholding the integrity of financial reporting. Moreover, this paper adds to prior literature about board of directors and accounting quality by identifying additional complementary factors - bank regulation and investor protection - and by focusing on a specific industry, the banking industry.

This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature about the link between board characteristics and the level of social responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008-2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper uses a resource-based perspective and balanced panel data analysis to explore whether the representation of women on the boards of directors of Spanish companies is associated with an increase in voluntary disclosure of information concerning intellectual capital [IC]. We find that gender diversity is a complementary corporate governance mechanism that has a significant positive effect on levels of disclosure of IC information. This appears due to the presence of women on boards serving to prompt stronger monitoring and oversight behaviour. Our findings should encourage support for policies that will increase current levels of representation of women on corporate boards and influence the setting of corporate governance requirements relating to disclosure by capital market regulators.

In this empirical study, we investigate the variation in firms' response to institutional pressure for gender-balanced boards, focusing specifically on the preservation of prevailing practices of director selection and its impact on the representation of women on the board of directors. Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain "a traditional type of board". In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance implications of board size, composition and frequency of board meetings on the performance of banks. Design/methodology/approach: The performance of banks is assessed on various parameters such as return on assets (ROA), Tobin's Q, non-performing asset ratio (NPA ratio) and the net write-off ratio (NWO ratio). The effects of changes in board size and composition and frequency of meetings on the performance of banks are investigated using feasible generalized least square (FGLS) estimation of panel data covering a time span of five years concerning 40 banks incorporated in India. Frequency of board meetings is taken as a proxy for board activity and involvement. The authors have also tested for endogeneity issues in the model. Findings: A curvilinear relationship was found between the board size and performance of banks. The authors have modelled a cubic form of the relationship for Indian banks. The authors' findings indicate that an increase in board size is associated with better bank performance within both low and high board size ranges. Alternatively, increased board size is negatively associated with bank performance in the intermediate board size range. The study did not find any significant relationship between performance and frequency of board meetings and board composition. Research limitations/implications: The behavioural variables reflecting the involvement of the board have not been incorporated in the model to determine the impact of board involvement on the performance of banks owing to the availability of data. It is hoped that this paper will be useful for major regulatory bodies such as the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Company Law Board (CLB) and stock exchanges in India and other emerging economies in devising listing norms and other governance-related aspects. Originality/value: Non-linear relationships between the board size and performance are not normally prevalent in emerging economies, especially in the banking sector. However, such a relationship exists among the Indian banks. This paper is the first of its kind to identify and address the same. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

We link genetic diversity in the country of origin of the firms' board members with corporate performance via board members' nationality. We hypothesize that our approach captures deep-rooted differences in cultural, institutional, social, psychological, physiological, and other traits that cannot be captured by other recently measured indices of diversity. Using a panel of firms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we find that adding board directors from countries with different levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases firm performance. This effect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, firm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use-as instrumental variables for our diversity indices-the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors' country of nationality.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the association between board demographics and firm financial performance of Karachi Stock Exchange companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The connection between board structure and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the relationship between board structure and the performance of Pakistani public listed companies by using a sample of Karachi Stock Exchange 100 (KSE-100) indexed companies. This study exploits the corporate performance by accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q), and economic profit (economic value added). Findings: The outcome of the study shows the positive relationship between the board size, minority representation in board, and family director's in-board and firm performance. The authors also find that, instead of adding value, independent directors in Pakistan are negatively associated with firm value. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on KSE-100 indexed companies from 2009 to 2013; however, a large sample and multiple years' data are required. Practical implications: The paper provides empirical evidence that board independence is not necessary for public-listed companies in Pakistan and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance and firm performance by introducing a framework for identifying and analyzing moderating variables that affect the relationship between board structure and firm performance.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between women in the board of directors, firm performance and corporate decisions as well as the risk of the firm, debt level, and research and development (R&D). Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates a sample of 41 Italian listed companies. In particular, using a panel data of 369 firm-year observations, during the period 2005-2013, through a generalized method of moment, the relationship between women in the board of directors and corporate decisions has been investigated. Findings: The results suggest that female representation in the board of directors affects corporate decisions. Women in the boardroom affect both financing and investment decisions. In particular, the presence of women seems to take on a complementary role to debt; it has a negative effect on risk and appears to have a positive impact on investment in R&D The results also suggest a strong relationship between female directors and firm value, especially when certain multicultural factors are considered. Finally, considering the concept of "critical mass," in line with the arguments of Kanter (1977), the results seem to emphasize a greater influence of women with respect to corporate decisions, moving from "tokenism" to a "critical mass" scenario. Practical implications: The outcomes of the application, besides improving the current knowledge on the relationship between female representation in the board of directors, innovation, financial, and accounting decisions, intend to reveal if the governance of Italian listed companies is efficient in determining company results and in pursuing optimal decisions. Moreover, the results could be useful for both policy makers for the regulation of corporate governance and the board of directors and as a suggestion to companies that regularly appoint the members of the board of directors. Originality/value: The work is not limited to examining the relationship between female representation and the performance of firms but instead uses a series of indicators of corporate decisions and multicultural, such as, the nationality of women in board of directors, the educational level, the past experience, and their interaction with the variables concerning the decision-making process. To the best knowledge of authors, this is the first study that investigates the relationship between women and corporate decisions in a single civil law country.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between gender diversity in a firm's board of directors and financial performance of firms listed on Bursa Malaysia for the period between 2009 and 2013. Using unbalanced panel data analysis, we tested whether gender diversity in the boardroom may influence the firm's performance, as measured by Tobin's Q. We employed four different proxies for gender diversity (the dummy variable for women, the percentage of women on the board, the Blau index, and the Shannon index) to provide a more comprehensive measure of gender diversity. This study suggests that a higher degree of female representation on the board increases a firm's financial performance. Positive discrimination favouring female boardroom appointment is therefore likely to persist as a feature of the corporate governance landscape in Malaysia.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Previous studies have established that firms' effectiveness can differ based on the differences among directors within a board, and between boards. However, studies have yet to establish the effectiveness of the diverse attributes of the board on firms' quality of earnings in an emerging market setting such as Vietnam. This study investigates the effect of board diversity on earnings quality in a sample of Vietnamese listed firms. The two dimensions of board diversity measures in this study cover a wide range of structural and demographic attributes of board of directors, using a diversity-of-boards index (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) and a diversity-in-boards index (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members). Earnings quality is an aggregate measure compiled from four accounting-based measures of earnings quality: accruals quality, earnings persistence, earnings predictability and earnings smoothness. We find a significant, positive linear relationship between diversity of boards and earnings quality, while the relationship between diversity in boards and earnings quality is non-linear, with a U-shaped curve.

Failures in governance, especially in regard to boards of directors, have been blamed for the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The increased public scrutiny regarding the actions and role of the board of directors in banks, following the crisis, inspires to examine whether and to what extent the characteristics of banks' boards influence their performance in the crisis. Using a sample of 72 publicly listed European banks, we find that banks with more independent and busy boards experienced worse stock returns during the crisis. Conversely, the better-performing banks had more banking experts serving as supervisory directors. Additionally, we find that gender and age diversity improved banks' performance during the crisis; hence, diversity matters. We also construct a governance quality index on the basis of board characteristics and conclude that governance quality positively affects banks' returns during the crisis. Overall, we find evidence that banks' performance during the financial crisis is a function of their boards' characteristics. (c) 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

The study examines the effect of female directors on firm performance for Indian firms, where the domination of family firms and a patriarchal society may reduce the importance of female directors. Our empirical results suggest that the gender diversity does not matter for Indian firms. Our further results support this finding by indicating that female directors face more attendance problems compared to male directors, and are less likely to be appointed in monitoring-related committees. Overall, our results strengthen the tokenism status theory associated with female directors, especially in family-owned firms and in a patriarchal society. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate board and management gender diversity issues in the microfinance setting with data (2010-2014) drawn from 494 microfinance institutions across 76 countries. We find that board gender diversity positively predicts management gender diversity. On the effects of board and management gender diversity on the financial performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), we find that whereas board gender diversity is negatively and significantly related to MFI financial performance, management gender diversity is negatively but insignificantly related to MFI financial performance. We show that 50% or higher diversity in either board or management is the threshold at which gender diversity is productive to MFIs. However, danger exists that an MFI that combines 50% or higher female representation on its board with 50% or higher female representation on its management team is likely to experience a tumble in its financial performance. The overall effect of these outcomes is that the push for more female representation on boards and management teams of MFIs should be done with a lot of tact and circumspection.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the board composition on financial performance in the restaurant industry from a stewardship theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The composition of board was measured as the ratio of inside and outside directors. Firm performance was operationalized as return on assets (operational performance) and Tobin's q (market-based performance). Panel regression analysis tested the research hypotheses. Findings: Using data from 25 restaurant firms from 2007 to 2013, the study found an insignificant impact of board composition on operational performance. However, a higher proportion of inside board members increases market-based performance. A higher proportion of outside board members decreases market-based performance. Practical implications: Supporting the basic tenets of stewardship theory, restaurant companies may consider changing the current practice of having a super-majority of outside directors and increase the inside board members. Because inside board member have greater experience with the organization and the industry, they have a better understanding of the status quo and are better able to respond to opportunities and threats in the environment. Originality/value: Considering the scarcity of research on how the board composition affects firm performance in the hospitality context, the present study is a forerunner in its exploration of the impact of inside and outside directors on restaurant firms' performance.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Employing information on all publicly listed Indian banks covering the period 2003-2012, the study explores whether gender diversity impacts bank behaviour. The evidence suggests that the value addition to banks from the induction of women on their boards of directors is not compelling, although executive women directors enhance bank stability. Looking across ownership, the evidence suggests that gender diversity in state-owned banks enhances stability, but at the cost of lower profitability. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

It takes advantage of a new and unique longitudinal dataset of virtually all Russian companies whose shares were traded in the RTS/MICEX/MOEX over 1998-2014. The analysis highlights a number of strong trends in the evolution of boards of directors, such as a declining participation of insider directors and an increasing participation of foreign and female directors. It also shows that board characteristics are linked to company performance (market-to-book ratio, Tobin's Q, ROE and ROA), suggesting that boards of directors play a non-trivial role in corporate governance in Russia. Testing for structural breaks in the relationship between board composition and firm performance provides some evidence of the changing role of corporate boards over time. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether companies with female executives and directors are less likely to be involved in financial reporting fraud litigation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a data set comprised of companies from the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse database that were involved in fraud litigation along with a control set of companies listed on the Compustat database for the time period 2007-2013. The authors use a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of fraud when there is at least one woman in an executive position or on the board of directors. Findings: The authors find that the presence of at least one female leader decreases the likelihood that the company will be involved in litigation for financial reporting fraud. The results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias by using a propensity score matched sample. Practical implications: The findings add to the literature which indicates that women tend to be more risk averse and are more committed to ethics policies. The study also supports previous research that indicates large firms with inflated market value are more likely to be subject to fraud litigation. Originality/value: The study combines the literature on the characteristics of women in leadership positions with the study of fraud litigation. The authors find evidence that the presence of either female executives or female directors lowers financial reporting fraud risk. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The impact of female directors on firm performance has lacked consistency in the previously conducted empirical studies, which may be due to the endogeneity problem, or certain characteristics (i.e. governance, industry, competition). This study examines the relationship between female directors and firm performance by addressing those problems. This study analyses all non-financial UK listed firms during the period 2004-2012 and employs several econometric models. The regression results indicate that there is little evidence that female directors have a positive and strong relationship with firm performance. But, further analysis reports that the UK's small listed firms experience a positive significant effect, because small firms do not suffer from the problem of over-monitoring and they have more flexibility in composing their boards of directors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of banking scandals in relation to corporate governance (CG) failures in an emerging economy, arguing that Anglo-American ideas of CG are misplaced in traditional settings. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Observations of annual general meetings (AGMs) and the personal working experience of one of the researchers, along with documentation, provided triangulating data on CG practices. Findings: The authors have found that both of the banks studied had adopted CG practices contrary to the expectations of the Sri Lankan CG codes. Key features of CG practices that emerged from their investigations of these two scandals are ineffectual central bank regulations, familial boards of directors, ceremonial board meetings, biased auditing practices and manipulative AGMs, relying on traditional structures of accountability centred around families, kin and social networks. Research limitations/implications: The authors argue, drawing on Weber (1958, 1961, 1968, 1978), that the traditionalist culture mediates the process of rationality in bank governance codes and regulatory frameworks Therefore, practices fall far short of expectations. Originality/value: The paper builds on the extended critique of shareholder-centric CG models and their transferability to alien contexts. It contributes to the CG studies calling for more appreciation of the need to move beyond the conventional view of CG problems as simply down to conflicts of interests. The authors complement and advance the decoupling debate in CG studies drawing on the Weberian notion of traditionalism. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive-based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement. Compared to acquirers in the low equity-based compensation group, acquirers in the high equity-based compensation group outperform by 9.54% in a five-day period surrounding the announcement date. These results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues. We further find that acquirers with higher equity-based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions. An increase in director equity-based pay also results in a lower acquisition premium for targets. These results indicate that equity-based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the association between the composition of boards of directors and the choice of external auditor among companies listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) in 2013. Design/methodology/approach: Consistent with prior research, audit quality is represented by two proxies, namely, a Big 4 and Non-Big 4 audit firm. Independence, diversity, interlocks, size and role duality are used as proxies for board composition. To accommodate the dichotomous dependent variable (auditor choice), a logistic regression model is used to test the hypothesized associations between board composition and auditor choice. Findings: After controlling for firm-specific characteristics, results show that independence, diversity and size are statistically significant and increase the likelihood that a KSE-listed company selects a high-quality (Big 4) audit firm. Role duality is also statistically significantly but decreases the likelihood of choosing a Big 4 audit firm. Practical/implications: This research has implications for regulators, shareholders, boards and academics. The paper underlines the importance of the composition of the board in increasing the likelihood of hiring a high-quality audit firm. Regulators can draw upon these results when assessing the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to study the association between auditor choice and board composition using data from the frontier market of Kuwait, thus responding to the call for empirical research into the issue in less-developed markets. Overall, it sheds light on the effectiveness of board composition and provides empirical evidence that it is an important element in the choice of auditors. The findings indicate that board composition may be a mechanism that can promote demand for high audit quality. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

This paper studies the advisory role of the board of directors in takeovers. I develop a model in which the takeover premium and the ability of the target board to resist the takeover are endogenous. The analysis relates the influence of the board on target shareholders and the reaction of the market to its recommendations to various characteristics of the acquirer and the target. I also show that the expected target shareholder value can decrease with the expertise of the board and it is maximized when the board is biased against the takeover. Generally, uninformative and ignored recommendations are not necessarily evidence that the target board has no influence on the outcome of the takeover. Perhaps surprisingly, under the optimal board structure, target shareholders ignore the recommendations of the board, which are never informative in equilibrium. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Do cooperative banks suffer from board deficiencies less frequently and severely than joint-stock banks? To answer this question, we analyze banks operating in Italy during the period 2006-2012 to examine whether the governing bodies of cooperative banks are less effective in carrying out their duties than those of joint-stock banks. Deficiencies in the governing body are measured by sanctions imposed by the supervisory authority. Research Findings/Insights: Findings revealed that the boards of directors of cooperative banks were sanctioned more often than board of directors of joint-stock banks. Furthermore, board turnover mediates the relationship between the cooperative status and board deficiencies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical evidence in support of the weakness of corporate governance in cooperative banks. Methodologically, our approach is novel in that we adopt a measure of board effectiveness/deficiency based on an independent third-party perspective (supervisory authority) that is not biased by the different objective function of the two types of banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings have several policy and managerial implications. We contribute to the ongoing debate on the proposal for flexible regulation of corporate governance for cooperative banks and emphasize that policy-makers and regulators should rethink the corporate governance structures of cooperative banks. In particular, the study reveals how board turnover should be carefully monitored to reduce board deficiencies at the bank level. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act demanded the presence of more financial experts on corporate boards to improve governance. Directors from lending banks require particular attention because of the conflicts of interest between shareholders and debtholders despite their financial expertise. In this paper, we examine whether commercial banker directors work in the best interests of shareholders in providing incentives to the CEO. We find that the CEO's compensation VEGA is lower if an affiliated banker director is on the board. Further, we find that commercial banker directors increase debt-like compensation (Sundaram and Yermack, 2007) and make it less sensitive to risk. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper aims to study the relationship between three characteristics of the Board of Directors (Board Size, Independent Members, and Number of Meetings) and performance (ROA, ROE) in Colombian firms during the 2008-2014 period. The analysis was performed using regression models in a balanced data panel that considered random effects. The results show that BD optimal size for the Colombian case is between 6 and 10 members; and there is no evidence to affirm that the relationship between the characteristics of the studied BD and economic performance is significant.

Expressions of dissent by corporate directors might be a valuable attribute of good corporate governance indicating the existence of an active board, but dissent is not necessarily a sign of independence, and can be disruptive and ill-motivated. Notwithstanding the potential importance of directors' dissent, the subject has been largely neglected in the academic literature, also due to the scarcity of empirical or anecdotal evidence. We examine empirically dissent of directors--expressed either by voting against a resolution of the board, or by resigning from the board--using handpicked data from the Italian market. Differently from the few other works on this issue, we also consider dissent expressed by non-independent directors. After an overview of the existing literature on directors' dissent, we discuss the legal framework of dissent under Italian law. We then present our dataset and discuss some methodological issues. In our empirical analysis, we address four questions: (a) What are the topics that directors more often dissent on? (b) What are the characteristics of dissenting directors in terms of age, gender, education, compensation, and who appointed them, as well as in terms of the organization of the board (e.g., if the positions of President and CEO are separated)? (c) In what types of corporations is dissent more common, in particular with respect to economic performance? (d) What are the consequences of dissent in terms of cumulative abnormal returns and volatility of the shares? Based on the results of the analysis, we offer some conclusions and raise some policy questions. (c) 2017, T.M.C. Asser Press.

We exploit IFRS mandatory adoption as a source of variation in the demand for conditional conservatism to examine the role of unaffiliated bankers on the level of conditional conservatism. We show that firms with unaffiliated bankers on boards of directors experience a significant increase in the level of conditional conservatism compared with firms without unaffiliated bankers on boards. These findings hold after we account for other country-level factors that shape the demand for conditional conservatism. Additional analyses show that the role of unaffiliated bankers on conditional conservatism depends also on firm-specific incentives arising from the contracting environment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the role of corporate governance arrangements on financial reporting outcomes. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Objectives Even though management talent is not, or should not be, a gender-related question, the smaller representation that women have in the executive governing bodies of companies is a well-known fact. Achieving adequate gender diversity on corporate boards does not only constitute a challenge on a level of ethics, policy and corporate social responsibility, it can also be an objective of efficiency, the veracity of which should be examined. Starting from this point of view, the aim of this work is to analyze if an increase in the feminine presence in the Boards of Management of companies leads to an improvement of its economic profitability (measured by the Rentability over Assets -RoA-). Specifically, for this research, we have opted for a sectoral analysis of credit cooperatives, which have been expressly elected for being non-listed financial entities, as well as being very homogeneous in their business model, both for its territorial nature and for the retail banking model implemented. Aditionally these entities incorporate the cooperative principles as a differentiating element of its corporate culture. The intention is nor to analyze the possible barriers that currently exist for the promotion of women to managerial positions, since they have already been included in several studies that analyze this issue, including the case of Spain (Ribas and Sajardo, 2005; Mateos et. al., 2010; Esteban, 2013). On the contrary, we want to know to which extent gender diversity affects the performance of credit unions both as companies and as financial institutions. Methodological approach The methodology that has been applied is based on the Generalized Method of Moments (MGM), used for the estimation of a dynamic linear equation with a panel composed of 78 entities during the period 2000-2014. This has been using the best source of public data of the sector, the Spanish Association of Credit Unions (UNACC). The dependent variable in the model is the economic profitability or rentability over assets (RoA), being the independent variables two measures of gender (proportion of female counselors and gender diversity on boards) and several main indicators of the economic and financial structure of the entities (efficiency, financial profitability, leverage, financial gap and solvency). Firstly, to run the analysis, the independent variables have been included on an individual basis, and then the impact of those related to gender through their interaction with the remaining independent variables, differentiating in both cases the effect according to the economic cycle. Results/Implications/Limitations The results obtained show the low female presence in the councils of the credit unions, since, on average, the proportion of female counselors reaches only 7.7% of the total membership, all of which explains the low value of the average Arithmetic of the Blau index (0,12), since these are not diversified Councils. Therefore, these results confirm that Spanish credit cooperatives have a gender gap even greater than the listed companies, both from Spain (13% in 2014) and from Europe (21% in 2015), according to the Spencer Stuart Board of Directors' Index (2015) and the European Commission (2016), respectively, which may be explained by the lack of regulation on mandatory gender quotas in their Boards. The results also indicate that the existence of a greater proportion of women on the boards of these entities contributed positively to improving their rentability over assets (RoA) through increased rentability over equity (RoE) and financial leverage. However, during the period of economic crisis (from 2008 to 2014) for each percentage point that the proportion of women in the council increased, the rentability over assets (RoA) was reduced by 2.39%, the rest of the variables remaining constant. The analysis of the research hypotheses allows us to observe, firstly, that the gender diversity in the Boards of Directors of the credit cooperatives analyzed is an important element to be taken into account in explaining the evolution of their rentability over assets (RoA), as well as through other economic- financial magnitudes, such as financial profitability, leverage or efficiency (H1 hypothesis). Secondly, the results obtained show that the effect of gender on the rentability over assets (RoA) has been subordinated to the existing economic cycle, since a negative impact is shown directly from 2008 onwards. Indirectly, through financial profitability and efficiency, the role of women has gone from being positive to zero or negative after the beginning of the crisis, depending on the proportion of women or gender diversity, respectively, as well as through the financial gap, therefore the negative effect (H2 hypothesis) becomes more intense. Conclusions/Findings As a main conclusion, it is possible to emphasize that the economic crisis has conditioned both the direct impact of the analyzed variables and the indirect one of gender in profitability. Thus, when we analyze the direct effect of women on the rentability over assets (RoA), we can see that the relationship between women and men is null or negative depending on the economic cycle, while the impact is both positive and negative, depending on the indirect approach used. This study has tried to fill a gap in the literature that analyzes the effect of gender on business profitability, such as the analysis in a sector of unlisted companies and for a broad period of time, which allows to contemplate different scenarios according to the economic cycle. In order to do this, a dynamic linear equation has been estimated by working with a panel of 78 Spanish cooperative credit institutions during the period 2000-2014 using the MGM. By doing this, it has been possible to measure both the direct impact of the proportion of women counselors and gender heterogeneity in the rentability over assets (RoA), as well as the consequences of the interaction with other variables, differentiating in both cases, whether this effect has been conditioned to the financial crisis in Spain (2008-2014). A further improvement of this research could be a qualitative aspect of a more difficult measurement that can be approached with a different methodology, analyzing the capacity of influence on the decisions that each woman can have on the rest of the members of the board in relation with deliberations and decision-making. This problem statement would mean focusing in the analysis of female leadership that can help understand the results obtained in this work, since the numerical increase in the number of women in boards cannot provide differentiation if they do not exercise the appropriate leadership in boards, that are generally composed of an average of 10 to 12 members. This study has been conditioned by a series of limitations, among which, fundamentally, are the non-possession and inclusion of data and valuations on certain characteristics that can be conditioned to the effect of gender on business performance, such as the characteristics of governance and the type of tasks performed by women on the boards. From another point of view, due to the fact that credit unions have a social purpose, it should be of interest to analyze other aspects of governance that allow studying not only the impact of women on the economic profitability of this entities, but also the possible effect that they may have in their social profitability, all of which stands as future lines of research.

This study aims to analyze the effect of gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, as well as the effect of education background of the President Commissioner on the firm value. Gender diversity is measured from the proportion of women in Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, while the education background is measured by the education background of the President Commissioner. In this research, the firm value is measured by Tobins Q. The sample used in this study consist of 70 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange in the year 2012. This study employs multiple linear regression to draw the research results. The analysis results show that gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors significantly affects firm value. On the contrary, the education background of the President Commissioner does not affect firm value. This result support the argument that diversity of boards will, through various ways, affect firm financial value in the long and short term.

The primary purpose of this study was to examine the demographic characteristics of Boards of Directors in the hospitality industry, and how those characteristics can impact a firm's performance during a major crisis. More specifically, using the upper echelons perspective, this study examined the impact of finance-oriented directors, and directors who were outsiders, on a company's stock price during the great recession. Results using companies from the hospitality industry indicate that companies that had the highest percentage of finance-orientated directors tended to fall further and recover less quickly. Yet, in the aftermath of the crisis, companies that performed worse during the crisis tended to increase the percentage of finance-oriented directors. The authors of the study assert that extending the application of the blissful ignorance effect is a logical explanation for the behavior found in the results. (c) 2017 The Authors

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that women who sit on boards of directors, as well as women that are part of an interlocking directorate, have on corporate performance. The investigation is placed within the literature on human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: A director data set for over 32,000 firms based in the USA, composed of 6,218 women and 54,932 men, is utilized. From this, regression and network analysis were utilized. Findings: It is found that female directors' participation in interlocking directorates translates into greater corporate performance when compared to simply examining female representation on boards of directors. Additionally, women involved in interlocks translated into greater corporate performance when compared to men. These results support the resource dependency approach. Practical/implications: Results of this study suggest that when considering female directors, corporate performance is enhanced when female directors already sit on the boards of other firms. Originality/value: This study highlights external network connections to differentiate between human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors.

Even though the financial literature has examined the relation between the composition of the board of directors and firms' performances, few studies have investigated the effect of adopting a specific corporate governance system. Past studies have not found clear evidence of the superiority of a specific corporate governance system in terms of economic and financial performances; instead, they have generally been limited to legal systems where the adoption of a specific system is mandatory. In this paper, we take into consideration the case of the Italian Corporate Law Reform, which gives firms the opportunity to choose, in a non-mandatory way, between different governance systems and in particular between a one-tier model and the pre-existing system prior to the Reform. Using propensity score matching and focusing on a sample of unlisted Italian joint-stock companies, we found evidence of a significant worsening of performances from 2003 to 2013 for corporations adopting a one-tier board after the Reform.

The research question of this research work is whether women and men of German supervisory boards differ in their human capital and therefore gender diversity contributes to diversity in knowledge and skills. The curricula vitae of 264 female and male members of the boards were compared. We find empirical evidence that women and men differ in the following dimensions: number of degrees, kind and level of education, length and kind of professional experience, number of board seats, external versus internal appointment, internationality and number of children. No differences could be found regarding family affiliation. Therefore, we conclude that women in the board broaden the resource portfolio of knowledge and skill in supervisory boards. This result represents an important contribution to the corporate governance research. Further, the study contributes to the human capital theory by analyzing criteria that have been neglected so far. The study provides the basis for solid discussions about women in top management positions. (c) 2017, Schmalenbach-Gesellschaft fur Betriebswirtschaft e.V.

This study examined the influence of gender diversity among company boards of directors and managerial ownership on corporate risk-taking. The sample was manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2013 selected using the purposive sampling method. Data was examined using multiple regression methods. The results showed that gender diversity on a board of directors (BOD) and managerial ownership have no significant effect on corporate risk-taking. This is likely due to the relatively low percentage of both variables in Indonesia, thus, they do not tend to affect corporate risk-taking decisions. The study recommends increasing gender diversity and managerial ownership in the corporate risk-taking process towards sustainable business practices. (c) Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

The recent Italian legislation introducing gender quotas on the boards of Italian listed companies (Law no. 120/2011, called Golfo-Mosca) has modified the structure of these governance bodies, tripling in a short time the number of women in the board. The article starts by this change to analyze, through the results of a web survey conducted on female directors, the consequences of the recruitment induced by the law. In particular, we deepen: i) the socio-demographic profile and the career path of the female directors; ii) their opinion about the Golfo-Mosca law and its outcomes. The research highlights the positive effects of legislation - new highly qualified women in the boards, the improvement of the decisionmaking procedures - and brings out some problems: the difficulty to start longterm changes affecting the situation after the validity of the legal obligation, and the difficult to change the company orientation in terms of equal opportunities.

The Companies Act of 2013 has provided top priority to Corporate Governance (CG). Among the various provisionsrelated to CG, the Act mandates appointment of a minimum of one woman director in the Board. The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI), so as to align with the Act, has revised Clause 49 to add suitable provisions regarding Board composition. Board diversity has also been provided top priority all over the world. However, the position of women Board membership the world over is dismal. The paper analyzed the present position of the women in the Board of Directors of BSE 30 (Bombay Stock Exchange) companies. The main focus was to find out the composition with respect to the inclusion of women before and after the enactment of the new Companies Act. The results of the study show that the status of gender diversity in the Indian Boards is far below the required minimum standards set globally. Certain companies are yet to appoint the required minimum women in the Board, as stipulated by the Act and SEBI. Drastic steps need to be taken to bring in the required diversity in the Indian board rooms. (c) Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.

Gender diversity in the workplace is of importance and the body of literature on gender diversity and corporate performance has consequently grown substantially in line with the increased interest in the topic. There are such contradictory findings on the matter that it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions from the various studies conducted. This research was conducted better to understand the effect, if any, of gender diversity in boards of directors on corporate financial performance. Board gender composition and financial performance of the top hundred companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2014 were analysed using multiple regression analysis and Structural Equation Modelling. Both Tobin's Q and Return on Assets were used as financial performance measures. No statistically significant positive or negative relationship could be observed between board gender diversity and company financial performance. While this is contrary to some literature, that found either a positive or a negative relationship between these variables, a large number of studies similarly found no relationship at all. A possible explanation is that the average number of female directors on boards of the companies studied was below three for each of the five years analysed. This implies a higher risk of tokenism, when there are three or less women on the board, and where women are seen only as symbols because there are so few of them. Another possible explanation is endogeneity, where the number of women on the board is argued to be a factor of company attributes. Or, perhaps, financial performance is possibly more complex than demographics of board members? While not providing any definitive answers, the research raises important questions about female board representation and highlights areas for further investigation. It is also noted that investigating whether female representation can improve financial performance is already indicative of a problem or form of discrimination. The representation on the board must be given according to the merits, skills, and qualifications of individuals regardless of gender. There have been 13 significant studies on this topic worldwide, but not in SA, with disparate results. Gender representivity is a major issue facing all boards, but the question remains - does it make any difference? This research considers the problem, finding no evidence of impact on performance, but highlights some possible issues. The case is made that the focus should be shifted to eliminating the obstacles of equal representation rather than the number of females represented on boards. Copyright The Authors, 2017.

This study examines the effect of gender diversity and board diversity on Malaysian firm performance. This study is different from other studies because instead of using publicly listed companies, it uses 3,735 private companies over 2009-2014. We find that gender has no significant effect on the firm performance but firm's characteristics such as firm age, firm's size, liquidity, and leverage have significant effects on the firm performance. Our research further indicates that ethnic diversity in the board of directors may give better performance to companies. This research implies two important findings for the policy makers. First, the encouragement of gender equality to private companies by policy maker may fail as it does not have any impact. Second, policy maker should not consider ethnic diversity in the board as part of policy because it may reduce the firm performance. (c) 2017 by De La Salle University.

This study investigates the association between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure and diversity of the board of directors (BoD) in Italian listed companies. Diversity of BoD in terms of gender diversity, CSR committees, board average, and independent directors are examined as to their influence on voluntary ESG disclosure. This rating is highly relevant to managers and investors considering ESG issues in their decision-making process. The factors that drive or hinder ESG disclosure are gaining importance. Despite the relevance of the topic, in Italy there is a scarce amount of literature regarding diversity in the BoD. The data set includes ESG data for more than 54 Italian companies for the period 2011-2014. The results indicate that firm's CSR disclosure is associated with independent director and committee CSR. In addition, women on BoDs is negatively correlated while the age of the board is not significant. Based on this study, shareholders and policymakers will have a deeper knowledge on the significant roles that board diversity is playing as a determinant of ESG disclosure.

We show evidence that female board representation is associated with greater innovative success, and thus enhances firm performance in innovation-intensive industries. Firms with female directors tend to invest more in innovation and obtain more patents and citations for given R&D expenditures. An increase of 10 percentage points in the tenure-weighted fraction of female directors is associated with approximately 6% more patents and 7% more citations. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, the positive association between female board representation and corporate innovation is stronger when product market competition is lower and when managers are more entrenched, consistent with increased monitoring by female directors improving managers' incentives to innovate. Furthermore, we find that female board representation is positively associated with performance only for firms for which innovation and creativity play a particularly important role.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Do women board directors change how companies do business? Firms face growing pressure to appoint more women to their boards of directors, yet little is known about the factors that enable female directors to impact their organizations. This study analyzes the representational thresholds that facilitate women's leadership in the area of corporate social responsibility. We test the predictions of token theory and critical mass theory to evaluate the ability of women to impact firm outcomes based on their numerical representation on the board of directors. Our analysis focuses on board composition and organizational outcomes in the Fortune 500 from 2001 to 2010. Our findings challenge the theoretical assumptions that solo and token women are unable to exert significant influence over their organizations, and underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper studies whether director appointments to multiple boards impact firm outcomes. To overcome endogeneity of board appointments, I exploit variation generated by mergers that terminate entire boards and thus shock the appointments of those terminated directors. Reductions of board appointments are associated with higher profitability, market-to-book, and likelihood of directors joining board committees. The performance gains are particularly stark when directors are geographically far from firm headquarters. I conclude that the effect of the shocks to board appointments is: (i) evidence that boards matter; and (ii) plausibly explained by a workload channel: when directors work less elsewhere, their companies benefit.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempt to find the effect duality Role of Chief Executive Officer, board structures and firm financial performance. Specifically, we refer to devote this paper on investigating the relationship between the Duality Role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the CEO tenure, board structures and gender diversity with tow measurement of performance in listed companies in CAC 40. We found evidence provide that board characteristics are positively correlated to the firm' performance. However, our results show a significant association between ROE, ROA and the board of directors' composition. We find significant negative association between financial information and equity-based management compensation. On the other hand, the presence of independent directors on the board seems to affect, positively, the level of financial performance CAC 40 firms. Likewise, the stewardship theory assumption, the CEO duality is very high and is significantly associated with a higher level of firm performance. Our results suggest a constant negative relation between firm performance and CEO's tenure. The results show that there is a significant relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance from our samples CAC 40 companies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of board gender composition, board independence and the existence of a board sustainability committee on the corporate social and environmental performance of Australian firms. Design/methodology/approach: The dataset comprises 2,188 Australian Securities Exchange listed firm-year observations (407 individual firms) from 2004 to 2015. The ASSET4 environmental, social and governance database is used to measure corporate social and environmental performance and their sub-dimensions. Findings: Our results show that firms with higher board gender composition, greater board independence and sustainability committees tend to have better social and environmental performance. This paper also provides empirical evidence of the positive association of these variables on the sub-dimensions of social and environmental performance. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection and various forms of endogeneity. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the relationship between sustainability committees and corporate social and environmental performance in the context of Australia. This study also overcomes the relatively small sample size and shorter study period issues of similar studies in Australia that provide inconclusive evidence on the relationship between each of board gender composition, board independence and corporate social and environmental performance.

Entrepreneurial success in family SMEs is largely determined by the knowledge, skills, and new ideas contributed by board directors, the most important actors in the formulation of corporate strategy and decision making. The composition of family SME boards has traditionally been homogeneous, as such boards usually comprise male family members. Boards' contributions, however, depend on their level of diversity and strategic involvement. This study analyzes the moderating effects of two main sources of board diversity in family firms, family involvement level and gender diversity, as potential means of enhancing family firms' success when exploiting entrepreneurial initiatives. This study also explores whether these two potential moderators depend on the strategic involvement of the board directors. Based on a sample of 230 Spanish family firms, we found that the link between entrepreneurial orientation and performance is stronger in firms with lower levels of family involvement and higher levels of gender diversity in the board. Moreover, the board's high strategic involvement may strengthen the positive impact of gender diversity and change the moderating influence of family involvement from negative to positive.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board of directors' characteristics and performance in family businesses. It offers evidence to the question of whether a family firm (FF) differs from a non-family firm and looks at the possibility of asymmetrical effects between periods of stability and economic adversity. Design/methodology/approach: A panel data approach was applied to a sample of Portuguese firms listed the on Euronext Lisbon exchange between 2002 and 2013. Findings: The results show that FFs are likely to have a lower proportion of independent members and higher gender diversity on their boards than non-family firms. FF performance is positively related to ownership concentration and gender diversity. There are performance premiums for family businesses, which have more gender diversity than their counterparts. These effects also depend on whether the economy is in recession. The evidence suggests that the presence of women on the board and the leverage and size of the FFs have a more significant impact on the performance in periods of economic adversity. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the small size of the sample as it was drawn from the Euronext Lisbon exchange, a small stock exchange market. Originality/value: This study provides input into the academic discussion on corporate governance and FF, an area which is in need of research. In addition, the authors examine this issue in conjunction with generalised economic adversity, focusing on the possible asymmetrical effects that the nature of the board of directors may have on performance in periods of stability and those of economic adversity. The role of board of directors is crucial to the understanding of corporate behaviour and the setting of the policy that regulates corporate activities. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine how friendly boards affect firm innovation. Using CEO-director social connections as a measure of board friendliness, we find that firms with friendly boards create more patents and citations. The positive relation between friendly boards and innovation are more pronounced when firms' advisory needs are higher or when firms operate in innovative industries. Friendly boards are also associated with higher firm value, especially when firms have higher advisory needs or when innovation is an important source of firm value. Our results support the positive view on a friendly board perspective that directors serve as valuable advisors to CEOs. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Various regulatory governance initiatives have strived for board diversity, as diversity stimulates creativity, encourages discussion, and enlarges the board's knowledge base. However, increased diversity results in superior decision-making only when the board is free from conflicts and acts as a cohesive group. In this paper, we extend existing corporate governance research by introducing faultline theory to the board of directors (Lau and Murnighan 1998). The idea is to show how a board's diversity structure can give rise to the formation of subgroups along faultlines. The resulting subgroup formation may, in turn, reduce board effectiveness. Using a sample of U.S.- listed firms between 2008 and 2012, results suggest that boards with strong faultlines are associated with lower firm performance, lower CEO turnover-performance sensitivity, and higher abnormal CEO compensation. Understanding potential unintended consequences of board diversity could be of interest to regulators and companies that plan to appoint new directors to the board.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

The aim of this research is to examine what impact female institutional directors on boards have on corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors who may or may not maintain business relations with the companies on whose corporate boards they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors on boards and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors on boards enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold on boards (11.72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors on boards also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12.71 % on boards), above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the diverse literature on board demographic diversity and to provide avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive literature review of theoretical and empirical studies published in leading management journals from 1989 to 2015. Findings: The literature review revealed several aspects that are related to board demographic diversity. These aspects have been classified into: definitions and types of board diversity, dimensions of board demographic diversity, measurement and outcomes of board diversity, reasons for existing conflicting empirical findings about the relationship between board diversity and firm dynamics, and research on mediators and moderators. Originality/value: Issues pertaining to board demographic diversity identified in this paper have theoretical and practical implications, and include avenues for future research.

The number of female executives has increased remarkably in recent years. We contribute to the investigation of the gender question by examining the relationship between the gender of the CEO and corporate board structures. We propose that gender-based behavioral differences between males and females may lead to differences in a firm's board structure. We find evidence that female CEOs are associated with smaller boards that are more independent, more gender diversified, have a lower ratio of inside to outside directors, a broader director network, and younger directors. We also combine these individual board characteristics to capture the overall monitoring potential of the board. Our findings are consistent with the notion that boards of female CEOs are structured for more monitoring. The results are robust to using a propensity score matching sample, a sample of firms that experience a male-to-female or a male-to-male CEO transition, and to controlling for endogenous matching between firms and CEOs. Overall, our results suggest that differences in board structures between firms led by male versus female CEOs can at least be partially explained by gender-based behavioral differences.

Impact assessments are an important component of a better regulation programme--an initiative of the European Commission launched to improve the quality and transparency of the EU (European Union) law-making process. In the current article, I take a closer look at the Impact Assessment (IA) issued by the European Commission together with a Directive proposing a 40% obligatory female representation on the boards of directors in European public companies. In the IA, the Commission defined an improvement of corporate governance as one of the objectives to be achieved by the Directive. The Commission claimed that the more gender-diverse a corporate board is, the better it will perform. However, it is questionable whether mandatory quotas indeed have such a positive impact on corporate governance. Here I argue that, to properly assess the impact of a given policy, it is crucial to examine how the policy measure itself interferes with corporate performance. I present both field and laboratory studies investigating the influence of mandatory quotas on company performance, individual attitudes and group cooperation. Next, I discuss implications of these findings for the evaluation of the IA quality as well as the legality of the Directive. The current analysis of the IA shows that despite recent improvements there are still considerable flaws in conducting impact assessments of the EU legal initiatives. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

This paper seeks to review the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between bank governance and performance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the existing research and offering guidance for investors and regulators on the major points of consensus and disagreement among researchers on this issue. Although the question of what determines the levels of firms' performance, with special emphasis on the role of the corporate governance, has long been the subject of substantial academic research, it gained increased attention in the banking industry in the last decade due to a series of financial scandals and, more recently, to the global financial crisis. In fact, in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, bank corporate governance mechanisms received heightened attention, accompanied by the renewed interest in the degree of effectiveness of such mechanisms, and their impact on performance. Given the vast number of influences on corporate performance, such as the numerous characteristics of the board of directors, there is an abundant literature on the determinants of performance. Thus, this paper tries to bring together this diverse body of knowledge into a coherent whole. Banks have unique attributes that interfere with the way in which the usual corporate governance mechanisms work. Thus, the main differences between banks and non-financial firms, which justify that some of the regularities found in the literature on the relationship between a set of corporate governance mechanisms and performance do not hold for banks, are also analysed. Then, we extensively review the literature on the board of directors and its impact on performance in the financial crisis and non-financial crisis periods. Finally, we also survey the (very) scarce research on the relationship between board characteristics and bank failures. (c) 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Purpose: Since 2012, the Brazilian Stock Exchange has recommended that listed companies inform them if they have conducted voluntary disclosure. The purpose of this study is to describe the voluntary disclosure by companies listed in the B3 in Brazil and to analyze which characteristics of the board of directors influence this disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The study involves quantitative research using a sample of 285 companies and 575 reports from 2011 to 2014. A fixed-effects regression model with panel data was used for the analysis. Findings: The results were statistically significant for gender and duality variables, which confirms the theory that the presence of women as members of the board positively influences voluntary disclosure and that chief executive officer and chairman of the board positions have a negative effect. The age and independence of the board variables did not present statistical significance. Research limitations/implications: As a theoretical contribution, the authors aim to complement sustainability, finance and strategy research by using agency theory and measuring the variable of voluntary disclosure and the board, which is rarely studied in this context. Practical implications: As social and empirical contributions, a better understanding of this theme in the context of emerging countries, which is the peculiarities of Brazil with little information transparency and well-known corruption scandals, is likely to aid investors. Increased access to company information can help investors better select their investment portfolios and assist in the choice of their board representatives in companies in which they have participation and voting rights. Originality/value: The fact that Brazil is an emerging country, where the lack of transparency of information and corruption in these environments stand out the importance of studying the subject of voluntary disclosure in this context. All data were collected manually specifically for this research. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study aims to explore whether the percentage of women on boards of directors and top and medium-level executive management positions in Jordanian banks had an effect on these banks' financial performance. To do so, the study employs a multiple regression model on data from Jordanian banks for the period from 2009 to 2016. The findings show that, contrary to the findings of many studies from developed countries, there is no statistically significant relation between the percentages of women on boards and top and medium-level executive managements of Jordanian banks and these banks' financial performance. However, due to the apparent advantages of the inclusion of women in such positions, as seen by the findings of many international studies, this study recommends that most Jordanian banks increase their currently small percentages of women on boards and top executive management positions in order to potentially achieve such advantages.

The study investigates demographic diversity, cognitive diversity and internal diversity within Islam among top-level management of firms and their impacts on the financial performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim and non-Muslim women and Islamic religious diversity on corporate boards are investigated. Even though numerous organisations desire to be socially diverse, the significance of diversity for organisational performance remains uncertain. Are profitable companies inclined to improve board diversity or do other characteristics of the company contribute to firm performance? Does the participation of Muslim and non-Muslim women on corporate boards affect firm performance? Does internal diversity within Islam affect firm performance? Data from 330 Malaysian-listed companies in eleven full fledged sectors were used for the period from 2009 to 2013. This study employed econometrics methodology from panel data analysis to fill the research gap in the current management literature. This study used the interaction approach to examine empirically diverse corporate boards and their impacts on firm performance. This discussion included: (1) a combination of gender diversity and ethnic diversity and (2) a combination of gender diversity and foreign participation. The findings suggest that demographic, cognitive and internal diversity within Islam are significant predictors of a firm's financial performance. Ethnic women on boards have a significant and negative impact on firm performance. Hence, companies having high profits are more accountable for encouraging diversity among top-level management.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most studies that have investigated the relationship between governance and performance of banks were interested in the developed countries and to a lesser extent, the emerging countries. In this study, we tried to look from an empirical perspective, at the impact of governance through some internal mechanisms, on the performance of banks in a developing country like Tunisia. According to Kolsi and Ghorbel (2011), the effect of governance on the financial and stock market performance is still unknown. This result goes in the same direction as that of Adjaoud et al. (journal compilation 15, 2007), leading to the lack of connection between governance and traditional performance measures. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of eight Tunisian commercial banks listed on the Stock Exchange over the period 2000-2011; we can conclude that there is no standard governance structure and that each bank should adopt the appropriate governance structure to improve the performance of the financial market, in general, and the banking market, in particular. The verification of this central assumption in the Tunisian context, therefore, is the fundamental contribution of this study. It is for this reason that the results we, even modest, have achieved allow enriching the issue of the impact of some governance variables varying according to the chosen performance measurement, which is a neglected theme in the Tunisian context.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Purpose: According to previous international studies, the impact of external regulation on bank risk is ambiguous. The purpose of this paper is to ask the question, "When do regulations matter for bank risk-taking?" by reporting the first empirical investigation of how the relation between bank regulations (capital requirements, official supervisory power and market discipline) and bank risk-taking is moderated by board monitoring characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Using SYS-GMM, the analysis of the interaction between bank-level boards of directors' attributes (board size, board independence and board gender diversity) and external regulation is based on a sample of 493 banks operating in 54 countries over 2001-2015, accounting for three measures of bank risk-taking. Findings: Regulations matter for bank risk-taking conditional on board characteristics: board size, board independence and board diversity. With the exception of capital requirements, the market discipline exerted by external private monitoring and greater supervisory power are unable to mitigate the propensity to greater risk-taking by banks resulting from larger board size, higher board independence and greater gender diversity of the board. Originality/value: The bank risk empirical literature is still silent as to the interaction between board governance and regulation for the purpose of examining banks' risk-taking. This paper fills this gap, thus making a significant contribution by extending our knowledge of whether and how board governance moderates the relationship between external regulation and bank risk-taking.

There is a significant debate on the real contribution of board diversity in corporate strategies. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of board diversity on the disclosure process within a firm by focusing on risk reporting. The disclosure of this kind of information has become crucial in recent years in capital markets. Results show that gender and ethnic diversity in the boards positively influence the disclosure of information on risks. These findings contribute towards the debate about why diversity matters. Our study has important implications for the director-selection process since our results highlight the importance of considering the diverse background of board members. Regulators can also benefit from this evidence in order to issue recommendations and/or rules on the composition of boards of directors, as mechanisms to improve the disclosure practices of companies.

Using a panel dataset of non-financial public companies in Italy covering the period 2005-2013, this paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between female representation on corporate boards and corporate debt. The presence of women in the boardroom might seem to push significantly on debt leverage and suggest a complementary role in the control and monitoring of agency costs. However, consistent with Kanter's (Am J Sociol 82(5), 965-990, 1977) critical mass theory, that at a level of tokenism women take on a complementary role and at greater levels, their role either becomes a substitute for debt level, or plays a weaker complementary role in debt level and in the monitoring of agency costs. The presence of women board members who are linked to the family firm appears to significantly decrease the degree of debt leverage. Furthermore, the presence of greater female representation in the boardroom decreases the agency costs to the firm. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Gender diversity in family firms is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars across several fields. Despite this, there are few literature reviews that synthesize these research streams in the context of family businesses. To fill this gap, we examined the literature on gender diversity on the boards of family businesses by providing some insights into how the typical traits of family firms' boards interact with the diversity effects linked to the presence of women. This analysis is the starting point for identifying possible research areas not yet addressed by scholars, and therefore defining the research agenda on the subject. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

The present research is focused on studying the effect of board director's characteristics on the real earnings management (management sales manipulation proxy) measured by the abnormal level of operating cash flows. Our empirical study has been conducted on a sample of 29 Tunisian-listed companies over the period ranging from 2009 to 2013. The study finds a negative impact of board size, board independence, and board meetings on the sales manipulation. Concerning the CEO chairman duality, the results show no association with the level of sales management. This leads us to conclude that the board of directors seems to have a significant effect on delimiting the sales management practice. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of board gender diversity on the transparency of corporate political disclosure (CPD). Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical proxies, CPD transparency and policy transparency, are constructed from a data set jointly produced by the Center of Political Activity and the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research. The CPD transparency score measures the level of transparency in voluntary corporate disclosure of the amount of political contributions and the identity of the recipients as well as the titles and names of the executives who authorize the political spending. The policy transparency score measures the level of transparency in the voluntary disclosure of the policies governing corporate political spending. Board gender diversity is measured by the percentage of women on the board of directors. Findings: Higher proportions of female directors are associated with more transparent disclosure of political contributions after controlling for a set of corporate governance and firm-level variables. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine whether and how gender-diversified boards enhance the transparency of CPD. It contributes to the literature by providing evidence that gender-diversified boards enhance corporate governance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the mediating effect of dividend payout on the relationship between internal governance mechanisms (board of directors and ownership structure) and the free cash flow level. Design/methodology/approach: Linear regression models are used to investigate such relationships applying data from a sample of 207 non-financial firms listed on the Gulf Cooperation Council countries' stock markets between 2009 and 2016. To test the significance of mediating effect, the author uses the Sobel test. Findings: The author finds a partial mediation effect of dividend on the relationship between both board independence and managerial ownership and the level of free cash flow. The results confirm the major role of outside directors in corporate governance. This governance mechanism contributes to the protection of shareholders' interests through a generous dividend policy. However, the author finds that large managerial shareholdings increase the level of free cash flow through lower dividend payouts. This result suggests that powerful managers follow their preference of retaining excess cash to their own interests. Practical implications: This paper offers insights to policy-makers of emerging economies interested in the development of the corporate governance. This study provides guidance for firms in the construction and implementation of their own corporate governance policies. Originality/value: The main contribution of the present paper is to examine the dividend payout as a potential mediating variable between internal governance mechanisms and free cash flow. Moreover, it highlights the issue of efficient management of substantial funds in Sharia-compliant and non-Sharia-compliant firms. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a first impact assessment of the Italian quota law in order to explore whether "gender equality by law" contributes to redefining, albeit in part, consolidating and establishing positions of power and decision making. The paper analyses these dynamics by focusing on a specific economic sector, the banking sector. The analysis strives to determine: whether binding quotas are giving rise to an apparent enforcement by building up new distortionary equilibria (such as new forms of horizontal segregation); what extent the financial crisis has impacted on the rhetoric of female representation, and whether it has pushed towards a "regenerative" organizational change aimed at achieving a more inclusive and egalitarian image. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 reviews the theoretical and empirical debate on gender diversity and quota impact. Section 2 illustrates the recent EBA Survey's outcome on gender diversity in the European banking system and focuses on the Italian scenario; Section 3 describes the Italian banking system and gives a first impact assessment on Italian banks of the mandatory gender quotas in Italy (the so-called "Golfo-Mosca law," named after MPs who proposed the law); some qualitative considerations are carried out on the reactions of Italian banks to the financial crisis in terms of "bridge policies" aimed at corresponding to a higher demand of customer satisfaction and fairness. Section 4 concludes and summarizes the finding of the study. Findings: The Italian banking system is not so dramatically ranked among the EU countries as in the recent past. The gender rebalance in management bodies could be considered rather satisfying (the number of female directorships grew by 7 p.p. from 2013 to March 2016). If we compare ten-year-old findings, the number of women on board of directors has tripled. But data clearly show a dichotomy due to significant differences between listed and non-listed banks. In non-listed banks, women are still relegated to an under-represented position, reaching only 11 percent on boards of directors (as against 26 percent in listed banks). The data confirm the results found in non-financial sector that women are significantly better represented on audit boards. In accordance with all previous studies, no relevant changes can be noticed on key-decision roles: no CEOs or Directors general are women in listed banks, and women are always more represented in non-executive functions. Originality/value: The paper analyses the law experience in Italy (law that is considered a best practice by the European Commission also because it is a unique case in Europe) as a significant case study by proving that rules such as temporary binding gender quotas (introduced by law in 2011) can be useful, but not always enough to remove blocking or distortive factors in organizational ladders.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores of the top 30 listed companies in Australia, France, UK and USA. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies covering a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015, the authors examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. Findings: The authors find that board composition appears to have no effect on large firms' CSR scores. This finding remains robust when they used out-of-sample analysis and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory stakeholder theory and institutional theory. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it fills an important gap in literature on CSR and corporate governance, as less is known about how board composition affects social activities. Second, this study controls endogeneity and sample selection bias which are main econometric problems in CG and CSR studies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

With the intention to analyze the effects of different board characteristics on the insurance companies' performance, this research article explores the impact of board gender diversity and size on the performance of the insurance companies in Croatia. It analyzes the impact of characteristics of both boards, the board of directors and the supervisory board on corporate performance. The analysis, conducted using dynamic panel model, covers all insurance companies in Croatia operating in the 2007-2013 period. The main findings suggest that gender diversity at the top positions is not critical for financial success. Specifically, it is established that women acting as presidents of supervisory board deteriorate insurer's performance measured by return on assets (ROA). This is also the case when more women are present in the board of directors. Moreover, the findings of the model measuring performance by both ROA and return on equity demonstrate that financial performance of insurance companies is negatively influenced by the number of members of the board of directors. The article upgrades the existing research by providing new support for the effects of board structure on performance in insurance industry, with specific reference to effects of gender diversity. Moreover, this study extends the existing literature in this field by introducing two corporate governance mechanisms in the analysis, that is, both the board of directors and the supervisory board. Furthermore, it is, to the authors knowledge, the first attempt to describe the effects of diversity in terms of gender on performance in the insurance sector. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Purpose: This study aims to explore how the economic recession and some corporate governance (CG) provisions can affect the performance of Italian gambling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across different business segments. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel sample of 2,135 observations before and during the global financial crisis. Specifically, the roles of ownership, boards of directors, chief executive officer gender and gambling business segments are investigated in the Italian gambling market. Findings: Ownership concentration has a negative relationship with the performance of foreigner- and financial-owned firms, while boards exert a positive role on performance. Interestingly, the financial crisis does not impact the performance of Italian gambling SMEs and some business segments, such as bingo, perform even better during the crisis. Research limitations/implications: Further investigations should analyze the role of single games on firm performance. The consumer- and firm-level examinations offer very different perspectives and scholars should be aware of this when investigating the gambling industry. Practical implications: This study might help both policymakers and other gambling firms, such as casinos, to better understand which appropriate CG model should be adopted and how it can positively influence performance, especially in recessionary times. Originality/value: This study contributes to studies on hospitality and tourism by focusing on the complementary role of gambling SMEs with respect to casinos. It also increases knowledge on the role of CG in privately owned gambling firms, which thus far has been scantly investigated by scholars. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

International Business (IB) research has surveyed firms' internationalization by examining the geographical dispersion of their sales and assets. However, less attention has been devoted to an important facet of their internationalization: the globalization of boards of directors. Drawing on institutional theory, we study the determinants of board foreign diversity by focusing on firms' sub-national socio-cultural context. We theorize on factors such as: attitudes toward immigration and conservatism that may impact the legitimacy of certain governance practices and may exert an influence on firms' propensity to internationalize their boards. Using a sample of S&P1500 from 2004 to 2014, we find support for our theory after using several controls. By bringing to the fore the interplay between sub-national factors and the globalization of boards, our study offers several implications for IB research. More broadly, our research delves into factors related to firms' sub-national environment that are likely to challenge their internationalization. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We re-examine the negative association between leverage and returns while also focusing on the role of boards of directors. To do so, we utilize the unique setting of real estate investment trusts (REITs), their high leverage, and the volatility that the industry experienced during the recent financial crisis. We find that during the financial crisis REIT board activity increased, especially among firms with high leverage. We also find that board activity helps mitigate the previously reported negative effect of leverage on returns during this time period. Post-crisis, we find evidence suggesting that firms with more active boards reduce their leverage if their pre-crisis leverage was high. Further, firms with more active boards have better post-crisis returns. Our findings are robust to using different measures of activity that take into account director experience in real estate and finance. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the demographic diversity at top-level management and its impact on the performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim diversity on corporate boards is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Although many organisations aspire to be socially diverse, diversity's consequences for organisational performance remain unclear. This study specifies the whole distinct mechanism and measures it independently, bridging as the demographic diversity among the board of directors (BODs) and bonding as the firm's financial performance. To maintain the homogeneity factor, the empirical analysis has been confined to 12 fully fledged sectors and 529 Malaysian listed firms out of 798 firms selected on the basis of judgmental sampling during the period of 2013. The paper applies the correlation matrix and linear regression model to justify this phenomenon. Findings: The empirical findings suggest that gender diversity (Muslim and Non-Muslim women) is positively significant with firm performance with regards to management, shareholders and market perspectives. It means that both Muslim and non-Muslim women are contributing to firm performance. Ethnic diversity (minority) and Muslim diversity (majority) have no impact on firm performance. On the other hand, interaction variables are positively significant with firm performance. It means that majority and minorities are essential for corporate boards to produce a greater performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research could include more variables such as director's age profile and foreign participation as well as other types of diversities, such as cognitive diversity and corporate diversity. In addition, another possible extension could be the investigation of diversity issues between small scale and large or high and low-profit firms. The findings provide insightful information to firms, as this study suggests that the diverse corporate boards can enhance firm performance. Originality/value: In recent years, diversity issues have been examined with regard to firm performance of the listed companies. Whilst extensive literature exists on diversity issues, this issue is still under debate and has had inconsistent results. The paper attempts to fill the gap in the existing literature, discuss the empirically diverse corporate boards with the interaction approach and impact on the firm performance.

Board diversity has been the recurring theme for discussions both in the academic and corporate environments. The concept of diversity is broad and encompasses not only gender and ethnic variety, but also the diversity of cultural, social, and professional aspects. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of the influence of company boards on corporate policies, by analyzing the effects of board diversity on firms' financial/ capital structure decisions. The results suggest that board diversity improves monitoring effectiveness and is positively related with firm leverage, in line with the effects of reduction of managerial entrenchment by means of stronger monitoring.

Recent literature emphasizes the importance of a director's external network of social connections. I use a sample of closed-end funds to show that internal, within-board connections are also significant determinants of shareholder value. I find that boards with shared education, employment, and family backgrounds exhibit lower market values, higher expense ratios, higher director compensation levels, and an increased likelihood of financial misrepresentation. Director turnover is lower within these boards, and new director appointments are more likely to share connections with incumbent directors. I conclude that internal board networks negatively impact a firm's governance environment and overall monitoring quality. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of corporate governance practices on firms' financial performance, as measured by comprehensive income (CI). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 237 firms from the Standards & Poor (S&P) 500 index during the years 2004-2009, multivariate statistical analyses are conducted to confirm the authors' main hypothesis. Findings: The results indicate that having high levels of corporate governance culture has a positive impact on a measure of firms' financial performance, namely, CI. Furthermore, they indicate a positive correlation between a higher percentage of external directors and financial performance, and a negative relationship between number of board meetings and financial performance. Originality/value: The main contribution of this research is that good corporate governance strategies deliver superior financial performance for businesses in terms of CI. This serves as a method of value creation, which is the ultimate goal of a business. In addition to the use of CI as an indicator of financial performance, a unique measure of corporate governance level is tested. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Gender equality on boards is a global and highly politicized issue. To this day, there is considerable cross-country variation in female board representation. We examine institutional supply- and demand-side factors associated with this issue. Our results indicate that a societal climate of gender equality contributes to more women on boards, mainly through fostering the supply of suitable candidates. Therefore, the glass ceiling should be improved through a societal supply-side effort which needs to complement demand-side (quota) regulation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

This paper explores the role of board characteristics of Indian banks on their market performance. We conducted panel data analysis on a sample of 29 Indian banks that form part of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) 500 index (covering a period of 8 years from 2009-2016). While ten board characteristics were considered as independent variables, Tobin's Q was considered as the dependent variable (Tobin?s Q was assumed to be a proxy for market performance of banks). Findings suggest that only three out of ten board characteristics (average number of boards served, CEO duality and number of meetings conducted) positively affect market performance of Indian banks. Our sample included 29 Indian banks covering a period of 8 years. Also, other corporate governance mechanisms, such as characteristics of audit committee, stakeholder relations committee, nomination and remuneration committee and risk management committee were not considered for the study. Hence caution must be taken in generalizing the results of the study. (c) 2018 AESS Publications. All rights reserved.

The declining financial health of public pension systems is increasingly becoming a budgetary concern for many state and local governments. While the academic literature has identified several factors behind the growth in unfunded state and local public pension liabilities, there is mixed evidence on how the composition of a pension system's board of trustees affects a pension's financial health. This article contributes to this literature by measuring how public pension board composition affects fund financial health as measured by state bond ratings. With a panel dataset of state pensions between 2001 and 2014 our results indicate that elected board members are consistently associated with lower bond ratings (and thus higher borrowing costs) while appointed and ex-officio board members are associated with higher bond ratings. These results are robust to a number of specifications. (c) 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Despite that fact that Iraq has gone very far in the liberalization of women, Iraqi board of directors is still dominated by men. However, gender diversity is one of the largest concepts of board diversity and a major issue within corporate governance where several studies seek to discover the influence of diversity on firm performance. This article aims at examining the effect of women representation on firm performance of Iraqi listed firms using panel regression analysis. The empirical results of this paper provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between female directors and firm performance as measured by Return on Assets while no relationship with the Tobin's q. The important policy implication of this finding is that the Iraqi Stock Exchange and Iraqi Security Commission should incorporate gender diversity in CG practices and encourage women directorship in Iraq.

In recent years, the US and the EU have pursued markedly different agendas in the pursuit of board gender diversity. The EU has taken a more pro-active governmental approach of mandated quotas, whereas the US is relying largely on the endogenous mechanism of shareholder diversity proposals. Despite their obvious allure as a means of bringing about rapid change, evidence is mounting that board gender diversity quotas may yield various deleterious side effects; and quotas may not be as successful in their core aim of promoting gender diversity as initial broad statistical measures indicate. In this paper we critique the expanding EU quota regime, and consider US shareholder proposals as an alternative change mechanism for improving gender diversity in corporate boards. As an alternative to quotas, diversity resolutions are often dismissed as ineffective because the vast majority fail to formally pass (with a failure rate close to 95%). However, on closer inspection, this 'failure' actually results in success. Contrary to the conventional 'folk' wisdom -- in the quest to promote gender diversity on corporate boards, the endogenous (US) mechanism of board diversity proposals has, to date, resulted in similar increases in gender diversity as the exogenous (EU) mechanism of government-mandated gender quotas. Furthermore, the former mechanism is more consistent with recent 'third-wave' feminist theory. We conclude with the policy recommendation that, rather than quotas, the EU should focus on removing the regulatory barriers that inhibit shareholder democracy.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the theoretical relationship between the board composition and the cost of capital (CC) is mediated by risk disclosure (RD) practices. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares techniques are used, and a sample of all the companies belonging to manufacturing industry listed on Standard and Poor's 500 for the year 2009 is studied. In relation to board composition, several recommendations issued by US governance codes are considered: board independence, board size, CEO duality, gender diversity, ethnic diversity, and financial expertise. Content analysis techniques are employed to measure RDs. Findings: The results show that boards that follow governance codes recommendations lead to a reduction in the CC through the disclosure of information on risks. Research limitations/implications: These results provide encouraging opportunities for future research about the real role of the board of directors and suggest the need for the analysis of the participation of directors in firm strategy to better understand the effect of boards on the corporate outcome. Practical implications: This evidence must help regulators and owners to set up adequate corporate governance mechanisms regarding the composition of boards. This evidence also presents direct implications for managers, who can better understand the value-relevance of RDs. Originality/value: This paper provides new insight into the literature, which highlights that the effect of boards of directors on firm outcomes must be mediated by the involvement of boards in specific strategies.

This article reports on a study examining the influence of women on the boards of directors of NHS foundation trusts in England in the light of a recent UK government inquiry into women in senior positions. A high female presence among executive and non-executive directorships did not result in significant differences either in financial return or service quality. However, female chairs or chief executives resulted in significant reductions in negative social outcomes, such as lower clinical negligence costs, without harming financial management. The findings have important implications for gender diversity and gender targets on the boards of directors in business and other sectors. (c) 2018 CIPFA.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

This article studies the gender composition of corporate boards of Russian companies, including its relation to company performance. The analysis is based on a unique longitudinal dataset of virtually all Russian companies whose shares were traded on the stock market in 1998 - 2014. It shows a relatively small representation of women, just 12% of all the seats, while about 40% of the companies did not have any female director. At the same time, both the share of companies that appoint female directors and the share of female directors on boards show a clear upward trend. The econometric analysis suggests a positive link between the presence of female directors on boards and company performance, especially when firms appoint several, rather than one, female directors.

This study examines the extent to which CAMEL variables, bank-specific factors, corporate governance and macroeconomic factors influence the performance of banks in Malaysia. Three-panel data models are used for analysis, which is the pooled ordinary least squares, random effects and two-step GMM models over the period 2003 to 2016. The results indicate that capital strength, bank size, remuneration of the board of directors, the duality of the CEO-chairman and economic growth have a positive effect on bank performance, whereas management efficiency, liquidity and loan growth have a negative effect on performance. The findings suggest that the performance of banks is affected not only by bank-specific factors but also by governance and macroeconomic factors. Evidence on the relationship between governance and performance indicates that increasing the number of independent directors is simply not enough to influence performance. Our findings provide justification for regulators to consider having a set of eligibility specifications to become a bank director to ensure that governance in the banking industry is further strengthened.

This paper investigates whether and how lead time in CEO succession matters by comparing disruption costs in firms with planned retirements to those with unexpected CEO departures due to death or illness. Using a comprehensive manually-collected dataset of CEO turnovers from 1999 to 2008, I find evidence that firms with planned CEO retirements have significantly longer lead time and lower disruption costs. Specifically, longer lead time is associated with more favorable cumulative stock performance and firm operating performance around the outgoing CEO's departure. In fact, firms can save approximately $136 million when there is lead time to plan for succession. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

This paper analyzes firms' choice of replacement CEOs after unexpected CEO turnovers, and the impact of the replacement decision on shareholder wealth. More specifically, I investigate whether the selection of replacement CEOs from the board facilitates a smoother leadership transition. I find that while selecting replacement CEO from existing board members allows the company to quickly fill the CEO position, thereby reducing uncertainty and transitional costs (measured by new CEO turnover, senior management turnover and delay), it may not be beneficial to shareholders. I provide evidence that replacing departing CEO with a board member is negatively associated with stock performance for up to two years. This paper is a step forward towards the understanding of the roles boards play in the CEO succession and new CEO hiring process. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

Gender diversity in corporate governance is a popular topic in management environment studies. One of the most significant components of this concept is women in boards. Due to the inequalities of women in boards there are a number of academic studies on women in top management. This chapter explains gender diversification problem in boards. Furthermore, reasons for workforce diversity in decision-making levels are determined. The role and critical mass of women members in different cultures are discussed. Finally, it introduces the representation levels of women in the boards of BIST 100 companies in Turkey. Data is obtained from annual reports, websites, and related documents of companies.

This study compares the board features of major listed bank and non-financial firms in Europe. We find that at the industry-specific level the structure of bank board's is similar to that of non-financial firms, although banks tend to have more meetings and committees. Second, when we consider country-specific board diversity, bank boards are similar across countries apart from in Spain where the bank boards have a higher presence of older directors, a lower number of independents and foreigners, and more meetings. Finally, when we look at domestic-specific board diversity differences we find no statistically significant differences. All in all there is not much difference between bank and non-financial boards.

Women and men do not participate in the national or global economy to the same extent. One of the critical factors in gender equality is access to the boards of directors in both private and public companies, as this is where the highest levels of power are concentrated. Sometimes the result of this historical tendency to exclude women is accompanied by an allusion to "smoke-filled rooms," where important decisions are made by powerful people. However, with a release of a law to establish gender quotas in Icelandic boards of directors, both the smoke and the men-only corporate boards vanished away in the largest corporations.

Women's representation on the Boards of Directors of public companies is growing in the world, and today it averages 12%. In Russia this figure is twice as low - women hold only 5.7% of corporate board seats (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 2015). None of the chairpersons of Russian corporate boards is a woman. At the same time, the role of women as members and chairpersons of audit committees is becoming more prominent. Women are holding positions of corporate secretaries. While more and more women head large Russian businesses, they are still considered very effective middle managers rather than good top managers. Many women hold positions of finance director or chief accountant. But in general, according to the studies of the gender representation in corporate governance, Russia is far away from such developed countries as Norway, France, Sweden and Italy. At the same time the proportion of women in Russian executive and especially legislative bodies is quite visible. This chapter focuses on the results of the few studies on the role of women in corporate governance. Special emphasis will be put on functioning women as members of the boards of directors of Russian companies with state participation as well as on personal experience of one of the authors serving as non-executive director. This chapter aims at analyzing economic and financial performance of companies with women on their corporate boards, examining whether the women's representation on the corporate board contributes to company's growth and development, or whether it is just a tribute to the 'breaking the glass ceiling' trend.

Business can play a critical role in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Contextually, business reporting on the SDGs can support organizations in planning, implementing, measuring, and communicating their SDG efforts. This study investigates the relationship between early adoption of SDG reporting and a series of organizational factors by combining data from two databases--provided by the Global Reporting Initiative and Orbis--to identify the organizations that addressed the SDGs in their sustainability reports and their respective structural characteristics. The study, using a logit model based on data from 408 organizations worldwide, indicates that early adoption of SDG reporting is related to a larger size, a higher level of intangible assets, a higher commitment to sustainability frameworks and external assurance, a higher share of female directors, and a younger board of directors. The study contributes to the academic and practical understanding of factors related to the decision to engage early in new sustainability frameworks and practices.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose: Using a data set of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, this paper aims to empirically assess the effects of ownership structure and board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, this study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, two stage least squares (2SLS) regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, together with a two-tier board system and no chief executive officer duality, the stronger the firm's performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holders' ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership are all positively related to firm value. Research limitations/implications: Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value: First, unlike most of the previous literature on Western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies used a single indicator of firm performance, this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using 2SLS estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation.

This study analyses the impact of women leaders on environmental performance in a sample of 96 listed banks in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region from 2011 to 2016. Gender diversity in leadership positions is explored through women in the board of directors, chief executive officer gender, and the interaction between these two aspects. This study sheds light on inconsistent results in prior literature by testing three theoretical perspectives: gender difference, critical mass, and homophily. The main results suggest that there is nonlinear relationship between women directors and the environmental performance of banks and that female chief executive officers play a strategic role in shaping this relationship, by confirming the homophily perspective for the banking sector. Therefore, leader gender diversity is an important driver of environmental sustainability in banks, which are increasingly involved in environmental issues either directly, as companies, or indirectly, through their lending activity.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

Going beyond the mere participation of female directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major boards of directors' roles (advisory versus monitoring) is best played by female directors in order to make a difference to shareholders. More specifically, we investigate the impact that advisory and monitoring female directors have on managerial opportunism with a specific focus on earnings management. Using sample of US firms, we find evidence suggesting that female directors holding monitoring roles mitigate managerial opportunism, as measured by discretionary accruals. In contrast to the current argument that advisory directors in general are better able to sustain and improve earnings quality, we find no evidence that suggests that advisory female directors are significantly associated with lower managerial opportunism. Overall, the results remain robust after controlling for potential endogeneity problems, corporate governance, and external auditor quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyze the efficiency of banks under board gender diversity and to examine the determinants of bank efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: Data for analysis were sourced from annual reports of 21 banks for the period from 2009 to 2017. A two-step framework was used: first, an examination of efficiency scores with and without board gender diversity computed using data envelopment analysis; and second, a regression of board gender diversity as a determinant of bank efficiency using panel estimation on an unbalanced panel data. Findings: The results reveal that gender diversity promotes bank efficiency up to a maximum of two female directors on a nine-member board of directors, suggesting a threshold effect on bank efficiency. Board size improves bank efficiency. Board independence is negatively related to bank efficiency. Also, powerful chief executive officers are detrimental for bank efficiency. Finally, the authors find that ownership structure, bank size, bank age and loan-to-deposit ratio are important factors affecting bank efficiency. Research limitations/implications: All bank-year observations with no female representation on the board were excluded. As such, this paper is limited to 21 banks. Future research should look at a larger data set and account for dynamic endogeneity. Practical implications: The paper contributes to bank governance structure, namely, gender composition of boards, and provides an insight for regulators and shareholders to estimate the role of men and women on boards. Originality/value: The novel feature of the efficiency model used is that it incorporates board gender diversity as an additional input variable, in line with the preposition of proponent of resource dependency theory.

We examine the resource provision role of the board of directors in ensuring substantive corporate sustainability practices. Specifically, we examine two channels of resource provision (i.e., the presence of non-executive directors with previous experience in environmental issues--EEDs--and network connections of EEDs) that can affect a firm's ethical and environmental behavior. Using greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from FTSE 350 firms, as a measure of environmental performance, we show that the presence of EEDs on the board is associated with lower GHG emissions. Further, firms with better-networked EEDs have better environmental performance. A possible mechanism is that firms with EEDs invest more in environmental technology. These results suggest that, in addition to the traditional role of shareholder value maximization, the board of directors also caters to the interests of wider stakeholders of the firm by facilitating substantive ethical practices.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the relationship between boards of directors' demographic diversity and firms' financial performance. In particular, we highlight how women and ethnic minorities can affect Middle Eastern SMEs' financial performance. Using an unbalanced panel of 1,855 firm-year observations of 371 boards of directors from nine Middle Eastern countries, our results support the positive impact of women and ethnic minority group members on Middle Eastern firms' performance. However, our evidence implies that when Western ethnic minority members increase, firms' performances tend to decrease, because these board members are appointed for regional and international board reputation legitimacy, personal business agendas, and links to the external corporate environment.

The most successful and longest-enduring family firms are progressively encouraging the active presence of women on their corporate boards. Why is the presence of women on boards so important for family firms? And how can policy makers and controlling owners encourage the active presence of women on family business corporate boards? By integrating the literature on women in governance and the goals of family businesses, we take a step toward increasing shareholder awareness of the economic and noneconomic benefits that women can bring to the family business boardroom. Using theory and empirical evidence, we show that the presence of women on corporate boards can be instrumental for the controlling owners of a family business to achieve prosperity and success, to preserve family cohesion, and to improve the reputation of the family and business simultaneously. Furthermore, we discuss the socioemotional and economic ramifications of excluding women from the family business board of directors. We conclude with four practical recommendations for encouraging the active presence of women on family business boards. (c) 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the moderating effect of the board of directors in the relationship between tax planning and firm value. Focusing on a sample of 105 European firms during the period 2005-2012, we found a positive relationship between tax planning and firm value. In addition, we found that board independence, board diversity, and CEO's dual functions have a significant and negative effect on the relationship between tax planning and firm value. The paper makes two contributions. First, it gathers the first evidence on the shareholder valuation of Europeans firms' tax planning practices and offers insights into corporate behavior. Second, the analysis examines an eight-year period considering the sensitivity of the board of directors and attitudes to tax planning time. (c) 2019 The Authors

Bank governance has received special attention after the financial crises of 2008 that have occurred. Nevertheless, the literature presents seemingly conflicting evidence on the implications of governance for bank credit risk quality. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of corporate governance variables of board size, board composition and board gender diversity on credit risk. Panel data regression analysis is applied to a sample of listed banks from the Tunisia during the 2000-2014 period. We improve the robustness of our results by employing four measures of credit risk commonly used in the literature as the dependent variable in our study. Our results show that the higher the number of board members, the lower the quality of credit is and, consequently, the credit risk increases. The concentration of power within the board of directors may increase bank risks when the cumulative functions of CEO and chairman negatively affect the weight of the board and make it less effective. Also, our findings highlight the importance of board independence and the presence of foreign directors in enhancing credit quality. Nevertheless, we document that the NPLs ratio increases and NPL coverage ratio decreases in the presence of state directors. Finally, we find evidence that the presence of a woman on board influences credit risk, as it is argued that female directors may differ from male directors with regard to their risk attitude, and this, in turn, may influence board's monitoring ability and its decision-making process. Therefore, this evidence provides beneficial information for supervising authorities, stakeholders and academics, and banks should take this into account during the composition of their board of directors.

China's listed companies have two-tier boards comprising of a supervisory board and a board of directors. The supervisory board has the responsibility to oversee and monitor the board of directors. Similarly, the role of the independent non-executive directors (INEDs) is to advise and monitor directors. In this paper, we investigate the main board structure hypotheses namely the scope of operations, monitoring and negotiation hypotheses for a sample of Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Our results provide evidence to support the three hypotheses. Interestingly, we find that the larger the size of the board of directors, the larger the supervisory board size. Moreover, we find that the higher the proportion of INEDs, the smaller the supervisory board size and this implies that INEDs are perhaps a substituting mechanism for the supervisors' monitoring role. Finally, we argue that as the Chinese governance structure combines both the German and the Anglo-Saxon models, this creates a conflict between the two boards with respect to the monitoring role. Our results, therefore call for a comprehensive reform in the Chinese governance mechanism. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

Purpose: The structure of corporate governance, as one of the important elements to be considered based on the different characteristics than other companies, such as women, expertise, tenure and management is different. But two measures for the presence of women in the board of directors and the size of director's board are considered as corporate content characteristics that can affect corporate tax strategies in avoiding tax or taxes timely pay off. The purpose of this paper is to understand the demographic characteristics of the board of directors structure on the board and tax avoidance in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Design/methodology/approach: Sample includes the 505 firm-year observations from companies listed on the TSE during the years 2012-2016 and research hypothesis was tested using multivariate regression model based on panel data. Findings: The results indicate that female presence on the board of directors reduces the corporate tax avoidance. Additionally, firms with a larger size of board of directors are associated with more tax avoidance. Originality/value: The current study is almost the first study which has been conducted in Iran, so the findings of the study not only extend the extant theoretical literature concerning the tax avoidance in developing countries including emerging capital market of Iran, but also help investors, capital market regulators and accounting standard setters to make informed decisions.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

This study examines the stock price response to Document 18, a regulation released in China in 2013 requiring independent directors with political connections to resign from the boards of directors for publicly listed firms. We document a significant positive price response in the window surrounding the directive's promulgation date. This response is also of important economic magnitude. Our findings suggest that on average, the market views the costs of hiring politically connected directors as outweighing the associated benefits. Consistent with this view, we document that politically connected directors often shirk their board duties, as evidenced by their poor rates of attendance at board meetings. Further investigations show that the value decreasing effect of politically connected directors is apparent mainly for firms in regulated industries and varies with earnings management practices. However, the market views politically connected directors favorably if firms have significant business transactions with the government. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the influence of gender diversity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG) and economic and financial performance of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 68 non-financial public companies comprising the IBX100 index of BM&FBOVESPA. For that, it was used panel data modeling, correlation and ranking by TOPSIS method. Findings: The results suggest a significant relationship between CG and economic-financial performance when mediated by gender diversity. This relationship was not observed between CSR and economic-financial performance. Thus, it can be concluded that in a diversified board of directors, in terms of gender, better monitoring of managers can occur because of the increase in their independence in decisions, as well as performance increase. These results diverge from the literature on the influence of women's participation in corporate boards in CSR. It is assumed that this result is because of the fact that the participation of women is recent in Brazil. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are the number of companies analyzed, the choice of ISE index to verify the CSR variable and the metric used to verify the CG mechanisms. Originality/value: In general, this research contributes to the literature of the area, especially in Brazil, in confirming that the mediating variable gender diversity makes the relationship between CG and performance more significant.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board diversity on the performance of firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) in France, by using five different measures of CSR across 89 Frenchcompanies from 2012 to 2015. The findings revealed that board diversity measured by gender is positively related to (SCR) performance. Moreover, after controlling CEO age and board characteristics, this study finds supporting evidence for a positive association between board diversity and CSR. The findings of the study emphasize the mass theory and are consistent with the argument that board diversity boosts firms' ability to satisfy the need of their stakeholders. The findings also confirm that board diversity is necessary to improve corporate governance. Our results remain robust using different measures of board diversity and methods of analysis.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the behavioral agency model (BAM) by focusing on the moderating role of CEO gender on the relationship between CEO stock options and risk "systematic vs idiosyncratic" and the performance consequences "positive vs negative" of these option incentives. Design/methodology/approach: Data on CEO's stock option portfolios are collected from the Standard & Poor's (S&P's) ExecuComp. This paper uses a panel data analysis for matched samples of CEOs in S&P's 1,500 listed firms over the period 2006-2013. Findings: The results indicate a more conservative, risk-averse posture in the case of female CEOs than for male CEOs when they are compensated with stock options for idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. The results also confirm that female CEOs in low systematic risk contexts, although more conservative, take more prudent risks that produce better long-term outcomes as compared to their male counterparts. Practical implications: Important implications for the design of optimal CEO's compensation packages emanate from this study. Findings provide useful tools for board of directors to design CEO's pay packages that take into account the different risk behavior of male and female CEOs with the aim of enhancing firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence within the area of stock option-based compensation by focusing on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk when the effect of CEO stock option is analyzed and performance implications of awarding options to male and female CEOs.

Purpose -- This chapter aims to evaluate the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards of directors and its impact on firm financial performance. Design/Methodology/Approach -- This study utilized both a systematic review and a meta-analysis, using a sample of 40 published studies, which gleaned financial indicator and observation data from 28 different countries. Findings -- As indicated in previous studies, while positive, there was no significant correlation found between the number of women serving on the boards of directors and firm financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications -- The heterogeneity between the various studies analyzed may present difficulties in making general conclusions. The chapter could also be subject to publication bias, as the selection criteria included may indicate a need for further peer review. Future meta-analyses should include data associated with other financial indicators. Practical Implications -- This study shows how composition ratios of men/women serving on corporate boards should be addressed in terms of proving for a greater diversity of leadership perspectives. Originality/Value -- Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have analyzed country environments as moderators for the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards and firm financial performance. The present study evaluates possible differences between the impact of the number of women serving on the board of directors on a variety of financial indicators (ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q).

The participation of women in top-level corporate boards is subject to intense public debate. Countries are considering binding quotas to increase the share of women on boards or have already implemented such rules. Although research on board diversity suggests positive effects on corporate governance and firm performance, the mechanisms through which these benefits materialize remain mostly speculative. This study focuses on boards of directors in a large sample of listed companies in 15 European countries and finds that female representation on nonexecutive boards is associated with reduced turnover, an increase in tenure, and also a higher performance-turnover sensitivity of executives.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the association between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance measured by return on assets (ROA). The question is whether an effective corporate governance mechanism is able to increase the firm performance of Bursa and Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Klang Valley, Malaysia. The main purpose of this study is the in-depth analysis of the corporate governance mechanism and construction industry Malaysia via Bursa and CIDB. Design/methodology/approach: Following the primary and secondary data comparative approach, data are collected from 46 listed construction companies and 250 CIDB-registered SMEs for the financial year 2015. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation test are reported, and model estimation is performed using logistic regression. Findings: The empirical outcome shows that the corporate governance mechanism is significant in case of the CIDB Malaysia-registered SMEs. While, it has insignificant impact on firm's performance for Bursa Malaysia. Practical implications: This paper offers evidence specifically for Bursa and CIDB Malaysia construction industry. It can also provide guidance to the board of directors for the subscription of shares under the corporate governance measures at Bursa Malaysia. The findings also suggest that CIDB should increase awareness regarding institutional investment to assist the securities market to develop further. Originality/value: This study gives an indication about corporate governance, specifically for the CIDB-registered SMEs and Bursa Malaysia. It also discusses the matter of firm performance under the light of corporate governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between gender and ethnic diversity in managerial positions and Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) operating performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ two-stage Heckman correction models on an unbalanced panel of US Equity REITs for the time period from 2000 to 2015. The second-stage model uses multiple operating performance measures regressed on a dichotomous variable that indicates if the REIT promotes diversity in middle management in addition to a vector of control variables. Findings: The results indicate that REITs that promote diversity in middle management with profit-and-loss responsibilities have lower operating performance than comparable counterparts. That is, gender and demographic diversity is negatively related to REIT performance as measured by return on assets, return on equity and funds from operations. Practical implications: The analysis indicates that while gender and ethnic diversity is socially responsible and may provide many benefits, diversity among managers and decision makers has to be carefully implemented in order to achieve positive financial results. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by investigating whether diversity in leading managerial positions, other than in top officer ranks and on the board of directors, have an impact on REIT operating performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and company performance and how a board's ethical commitment can influence this relationship. Prior studies documented mixed evidence on the corporate governance and corporate performance relationship, which can be due to the influence of a board's ethical commitment and will shape the corporate governance mechanism in the company and, in turn, influence performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected data for two years, i.e. 2013 and 2014, from the biggest 500 Malaysian companies listed in the stock exchange. Corporate governance is measured based on the requirements of the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG), while a board's ethical commitment is measured based on the MCCG and various international best practices. Corporate performance is measured based on return on equity, return on assets, net profit margin, market-to-book value and TobinQ. Findings: A board's ethical commitment was found to be significant in increasing the strength of the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance. The findings are robust to the alternative performance measurements and lagged one-year corporate performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides further evidence on the importance of ethical practices to improve corporate environment and, hence, sustain a company's performance. This study, however, was conducted on only large companies with a limited data collection period. Practical implications: This study provides an indicator that the policymaker and regulatory authorities need to double their efforts in promoting and encouraging a board of directors to take a bold step in improving its ethical culture. Shareholders and investors need to use their power and rights to demand the company to improve their governance and ethical practices. Originality/value: This study is original, as it measures a board's ethical commitment from various sources of local and international best practices such as Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Norway, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey, the UK and the USA. It also contributes to the literature and theoretical understanding of the interaction between a board's ethical commitment and corporate governance on corporate performance, particularly in developing countries like Malaysia, which is scarce in the literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the perceptions of independent directors in Vietnam about their roles and challenges when sitting on the boards of listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses mailed questionnaires to collect data. The authors sent surveys to 810 independent directors from 354 listed companies and received feedback from 170 respondents. Findings: The authors examine several aspects of independent directors' work on the board (such as the roles of and challenges for independent directors) as well as board environment (such as information provision or board interaction). Findings suggest that independent directors in Vietnam place more emphasis on their advisory role than their monitoring role. In addition, they also point out their challenges including information asymmetries and the influence of controlling shareholders. These challenges are significant and they prevent independent directors to properly execute their independent role on the board. These findings reflect the unique features of corporate governance in transition economies. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature through providing an insightful view about the nature of the work performed by this type of director in a transition economy. The study is also one of the first studies to use a qualitative instrument to provide an explanation of how controlling shareholders influence independent directors on boards of directors.

Shareholders, the board of directors, and potential future employers are continually assessing any CEO's quality. As documented by an extensive literature, such assessment plays a critical role in corporate governance because it generates incentives (good and bad), introduces assorted risks, and affects the various battles that rage among the relevant actors for corporate control. Consequently, assessment (or learning) is a key perspective from which to study, understand, and possibly even regulate corporate governance. Moreover, because learning is a behavior notoriously subject to systematic biases, assessment is a natural avenue through which to introduce behavioral and psychological insights into the study of corporate governance.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

We examine the relation between reserve management and a set of audit committee characteristics of property-liability insurers, using reserve errors as a proxy for reserve management. We find that insurers with three audit committee characteristics have more conservative loss reserve estimations: larger audit committee size and more members with accounting expertise, and more audit committee meetings. Our results also find that three recommendations of the 1999 Blue Ribbon Committee can make corporate audit committees more effective: a minimum audit committee size, a minimum level of accounting expertise, and a minimum number of audit committee meetings. These results were obtained when we controlled for board of director characteristics, firm-specific characteristics, and Sarbanes-Oxley. Some board composition variables (e.g., director ownership) also have an impact on reserve management during our study period. The evidence overall suggests that the audit committee and some board characteristics have an impact on reserve management (earnings management) even in a regulated environment such as the insurance industry.

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

This study aims to investigate both relationship and influence of gender diversity in the company's board of directors and financial ratios on company's performance. In Indonesia, the number of females as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) leading public companies is quite numerous. It allows researcher to compare the performance of companies with different gender diversity statistically. The study investigated 364 companies from 9 sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in the period of 2014-2017. Balanced panel data regression was used to analyse whether gender diversity on the board of directors and financial ratios affected the company's performance. The results of the estimation showed that Price to Book Value, Debt Equity Ratio, Current Ratio and Total Asset Turnover influenced the company's performance. Although the influence of gender diversity was not significant, the results of the difference test proved that there are differences on company's performance, led by either female CEOs or male CEOs. These positive results will support the development of gender diversity in Indonesia's business world. (c) 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the mechanisms that were being used to enhance board accountability of Ghanaian listed banks, and how board accountability can be improved. Design/methodology/approach: The 2011 and 2016 annual reports of listed banks on the Ghana Stock Exchange were examined, and a survey questionnaire was sent to board members of nine banks. Findings: The results show that the directors of Ghanaian listed banks prioritise a shareholder approach to accountability, with a shift towards stakeholders. Audit committees, external audits and internal audits were the main mechanisms used by these banks to enhance board accountability. Some of these mechanisms were not used effectively by a number of these banks. Practical implications: Board accountability can be improved by appointing very competent people to the board, the national adoption of a mandatory code of corporate governance, regular rotation of external auditors and requiring non-executive directors to stand for re-election more frequently. Our research identifies weaknesses of accountability mechanisms and offers timely recommendations for banks and regulators to build stronger corporate governance systems. Originality/value: This study obtained valuable opinions of the boards of directors, provides insights on boards of Ghanaian listed banks and contributes to the literature of corporate governance and accountability in Africa.

The present research article is an attempt to add something new and revalidate the influence of already existing corporate governance dimensions related to the board of directors on listing-day performance of the Indian initial public offering (IPO) firms measured through underpricing. Like other emerging market economies, firms in the Indian economy are also characterized by concentrated ownership held by an owner or a promoter in the context of the Indian corporate environment. In the backdrop of this concentrated complex ownership structure, the present study analyses the influence of the board of directors on underpricing when the appointment of such directors is largely an affair handled by such owners, whom they are given the task to monitor. The sample consists of 471 IPO firms which went public during the time period from January 2003 to December 2017. Results obtained from the regression analysis show that the board size and board committees act as information signals for Indian IPO firms having a significant and negative relation with listing-day initial excess returns. Other board-related dimensions of governance do not have significant influence on underpricing. Overall board variables have a very miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing in Indian IPO firms. (c) 2019 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Using a detailed dataset on the meeting sub-structure of the board, this paper investigates the time trends and cross-sectional determinants of internal boardroom control. First, I document that the principal governance reform following Sarbanes-Oxley was the removal of the CEO as a participating member in board monitoring and investment decisions. Consistent with this being against the preferences of the average CEO, I find that CEO power is negatively related to monitoring work handled outside of the CEO's presence and positively related to board-time spent in the executive committee. Together the results highlight internal operations as governance concerns of the modern board. (c) 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Structural sources of power have shifted dramatically in corporate America. Recently, the fracturing of the corporate interlock network threatens corporate managers' capacity to act as a unified group in support of their shared interests, potentially destroying managerialism and elevating shareholder power. Paradoxically, however, the fracturing of the corporate elite has not led to a widespread retreat of managerialism. Corporate managers have replaced their collective structural resources, embedded in their board interlock network, with organizational structural resources located within their firms. By adopting lone-insider board structures where the CEO is the only employee on the board of directors, CEOs establish brokerage positions within their focal firms, allowing them to preserve their autonomy even as the broader network withers. Firms nested in cohesive communities were the first to adopt lone-insider boards, supplementing and eventually replacing closure with brokerage as a structural resource. These alternative structural resources operated to preserve managerialism during different times. Network closure traditionally helped to preserve managerialism against shareholder pressure, but this effect disappeared as the network fragmented in the mid-2000s. In its absence, managers increasingly relied on organizational brokerage positions to maintain their autonomy. Consequently, managerialism remains surprisingly robust in the era of a fractured corporate board interlock network because top managers have become more focused on establishing positions of power within their own firms.

This article reviews the literature on the social networks of directors as examined in major finance and accounting journals. The empirical literature in finance and accounting confirms the existence and the significant role of these networks on accounting choices, governance or performance. After clarifying a number of concepts, we summarize the academic knowledge about the influence of board networks. We are able to suggest possible extensions to this line of research, using both different perceptions on network effect between finance and accounting and methodological developments put forward in some articles.

The emerging markets undergo constant transformations and changes, and thus, a change of strategy can be critical for companies. However, the impact of R&D investment on firm performance and the role of the board of directors that makes decisions about a company's innovative activities remain inconclusive. This paper investigates the relationship between a board of directors' composition and structure in innovative companies and firm performance. Using the panel data of innovative Russian public companies that made R&D investments in 2011-2013, we found a positive relationship between the boards' independence and ROA as an indicator of firm performance. Moreover, it was shown that innovative companies that establish a strategy committee will on average have a higher ROA ratio than innovative companies without such a committee. Innovative firms in emerging markets might consider creating strategic committees and increasing board independence to enhance their performance and increase the number of successful R&D investments.

Purpose -- We examine gender diversity in Spanish multinational companies to test whether their policies in the different countries (i.e. institutional contexts) in which they operate (mainly Latin American countries) are consistent with institutional norms. Design/Methodology/Approach -- After reviewing the relevant literature, we compare longitudinal gender employment data for some of the largest Spanish multinationals. We then extend the analysis to different organizational levels as well as cross-sectionally, to their Latin American subsidiaries. Findings -- While not universal, the largest Spanish multinationals show progress in their compliance of gender recommendations within their national borders, in spite of the voluntary character of the relevant legislation. In addition, their subsidiaries sometimes exhibit better gender proportions than the national averages in Latin American countries. Research Limitations/Implications -- The study's emphasis on some of the largest Spanish multinational corporations cannot be considered representative of all Spanish companies or of subsidiaries in those host countries. Practical Implications -- This study may be of use for politicians, boards of directors, and other decision makers that need to be factually aware of the way these firms manage workplace diversity. Originality/Value -- This study shows that some of the largest Spanish firms are slowly exhibiting responsible behavior with respect to female employment, both longitudinally and in their subsidiaries. The fact that this is not a consistent tendency lends support to the argument that existing legislation should have stronger normative pressures, such as fines and penalties for noncompliance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to create a strong connection among the gender diversity literature in the stream of gender quotas in the international context and the main legislation on gender diversity - the Law 120/2011 "Golfo-Mosca" - in Italy requiring listed companies and companies under the public control to implement policies for increasing board diversity. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a structured literature review method to propose relevant issues on this topic applying an innovative analytical framework based on the "article focus." Additionally, an interview to a CEO of an Italian Bank has been done. Findings: In this step, results seem to underline the prominence of literature analyzing "woman in board of directors" promoting board diversity in the light of good governance. Additionally, this analysis is functional to the proposition of interesting insights from the Golfo-Mosca Law's analysis in Italy emphasizing primary effects of its application during past seven years. Originality/value: Findings of this paper are original, as it is the first time that a research connects results from the structured literature review on gender issues and the related Italian law to draft emerging and thrilling issues in the light of transparent and responsible corporate governance system.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

The aim of this research is to show how the capital structure policy is affected by earnings management and corporate governance characteristics. This study is performed on a sample of SBF 120 listed companies over the period 2009-2014. Raman and Shahrur's (2008) model is used for calculation of discretionary accruals. Using two fixed-effects models, we confirm the significant relationship between earnings management and capital structure. Also, we find significant relationships between capital structure and some board of directors' characteristics such as size, independence and CEO duality. Finally, we find significant influence of institutional participation and profitability on capital structure policy. These findings add new evidence to the existing literature about capital structure determinants and provide a confirmation of the significant effects of both earnings management and board of directors' characteristics on the company's debt level.

Considering the importance of good corporate governance in the banking industry, the study has been designed to investigate the managerial perceptions on interrelationship among good corporate governance, risk management, and ethical investment of the commercial banks of Bangladesh. Bangladesh has been selected as a field of study for three reasons. Firstly, banking is the leading sector in Bangladesh. Secondly, banking sector has been highly criticized in the recent times due to Bangladesh Bank scandal. Thirdly, banking is gradually being challenging services in Bangladesh. As a financial intermediary, bank has to ensure good corporate governance for smooth operations and reducing agency problem. As a trustee, bank deals with the money of others through various schemes of investment. Ethical investment known as social responsible investment is an indicator of good corporate governance. A structured questionnaire has been used to gather perceptions of managers of the sample banks. The results suggest that the most important factors for effective CG were the board of directors, auditors and managers of the various departments. The study also finds that risk taking behavior of the bank is influenced by the direction of board of directors. In this study corporate governance variables have been categorized with some sub-indices. Board's structure with independent directors and well communication with supervisors ensure the efficient risk management practices in the banks where internal audit system and transparent disclosures of the board ensure the ethical investment practices.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

Putting together the puzzles from all the previous chapters, this chapter starts to explore and explain how the discourses of legitimacy and paradigm, as discussed in Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6, are manifested in the specific governance structure in Chinese banks. Reflecting on the production of the board of director in generic corporations then banking organizations, the chapter studies specifically the organization and behavior of the board of directors in Chinese banks, which embraces the orientation of the bank board, its composition, the board size and its independence. Illustrating the hybrid nature of the paradigm discourses of the enhanced shareholder primacy and diversified stakeholder theory and relevant legitimacy discourses, the board of directors in Chinese banks are observed to be heavily guided toward sustainable profitability to the shareholders, active support for economic development, and balance of interests of various stakeholders. Similar representation of discourses of legitimacy and paradigm is demonstrated in the board composition, the board size, and the board independence in Chinese banking industry.

This article aims to shed light on the involvement of women who play governance roles in family businesses. For this purpose, we present the results of empirical research carried out on a sample of 233 Italian medium-sized family businesses, analysed from 2007 to 2014. Our analysis has a twofold objective: (1) understand how the presence of women on the boards of medium-sized family firms has evolved in recent years; (2) investigate factors that can influence the presence of women on the boards of these companies. To achieve this goal, we first conducted a descriptive analysis to understand better whether and how the involvement of women in governance roles had changed over time. Then we carried out a regression analysis to explore whether and how firms' governance characteristics can influence the involvement of women on the boards of directors. This paper contributes to enriching studies on women in family businesses by focusing on women's involvement in governance roles. While previous empirical research mainly refers to large and listed firms, we focused on medium-sized family businesses, which are playing a central role in many economies. In addition, our study increases the extant literature on this topic by considering specific firms' governance attributes. In fact, we posit that the female participation on the board of directors could be influenced by family involvement in ownership, the generational stage in control and the age of the board members.

Corporate governance remains a privileged field for researchers in management sciences. The interest in looking at the governance bodies is that they are supposed to play a very important role in driving the business towards the goals set efficiency and effectiveness. Determining the composition and the ideal functioning of these governance bodies is an ultimate goal for researchers and practitioners, but the road is still long because the conclusions of the studies made up to this day on the subject do not unanimously. One of the topics (and little discussed) about the effect of gender diversity on the effectiveness of the board of directors.The purpose of this article is to present a contribution in the analysis of the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors on the financial performance of Moroccan banks. After a presentation of the mission of the board of directors and its objectives, we presented the main theories, which evoked our problematic, then to present a synthesis of the works, which studied the impact of the presence of the women on the performance of the banks and finally an empirical analysis of this relationship. This analysis is made from the data of six Moroccan banks over a period of 10 years. The results showed that there is only one positive and significant relationship between the presence of women and the financial performance expressed by ROE and ROA.

In the last decade, the study of the effect of women's presence in management bodies has grown. Many researchers are interested in this topic and have tried to approach it in different ways. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the study of gender diversity in the board of directors and the performance of the company. Our contribution is to present a synthesis of the main research on the effect of gender diversity on the board of directors. To achieve this goal, after a theoretical review, we used articles that are derived from the databases namely: Scopus, web of Science and Jstor. The synthesis of the main conclusions of these articles is made according to the object of the study, two axes of research are distinguished: the effect of the diversity of the board of directors on the effectiveness of the board of directors and the performance of the company and the effect of the presence of women on risk taking in firms. The article is enriched by examples of European countries that have applied quotas for women, and this is intended to show the effect of these quotas on the effect of the presence of women on boards of directors, their effects on its functioning and also their effects on business performance.

Integrated reporting is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. It is a tool capable of better representing the capacity of companies to create value over time. In recent years, attention to this new reporting tool has grown in both professional and academic fields. However, despite past research that has analysed many aspects of integrated reporting, the integrated reporting quality and its determinants are still little explored. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the effect of board characteristics on integrated reporting quality according to an agency theory approach. The findings, based on a sample of 134 international firms, show a positive relationship between the size, independence, diversity, and activity of a board with integrated reporting quality. This study contributes to enriching literature in this area in various ways. First, it broadens the scope of application of agency theory; second, it identifies further internal determinants of integrated reporting quality. This is the first study that analyses the impact of the characteristics of a board as a determining factor of integrated reporting quality. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

As a result of recent climate change impacts, environmental sustainability has received enormous attention from scholars and policy makers. Environmental innovation is one of the major ways of acting in harmony with the environment, but it also requires a significant amount of resources and strong corporate commitment. As boards of directors have great influence over the strategic direction of firms and are responsible for corporate environmentalism, we examine the likely relationship between board gender diversity (BGD) and environmental innovation measured as process innovation and product innovation. Based on a relatively large dataset (10,334 firm-year observations) of U.S. listed firms, we find that BGD has a significant positive association with environmental innovation. Furthermore, we also find that this relationship is more pronounced in less profitable firms and in environmentally sensitive industries. Our results remain robust to endogeneity issues and alternative proxies. We interpret our results under upper echelon and gender socialization theories and suggest important implications for policy makers. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board composition on environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting in the Gulf countries. Despite the vast literature on the significance of ESG disclosure on firms' performance, trust and reputation, there are relatively few studies on the influence of board structure on ESG disclosure in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Gulf countries are witnessing a fast growing capital markets and having serious efforts to attract foreign investments to divert their economies from the oil and gas reliance. This could be facilitated by illustrating firms' good citizenship and communicating the fulfillment of their social obligation. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines publically listed companies between 2008 and 2017. Thomson Reuter's database is used to collect the ESG disclosure scores and governance information. The authors apply multiple panel data regressions and sensitivity testing to ensure the robustness of the results. Findings: Examining publically listed companies for a 10-year period shows that higher board independence and female board participation facilitate the transmission of a firm's positive image by improving social responsibility. Independent boards of directors and participation among women serve as catalysts to strike an effective balance between firms' financial targets and social responsibilities. In contrast, boards chaired by chief executive officers are less supportive in executing a social agenda and consequently reporting their ESG activities. Practical implications: The results suggest that firms that appoint a sustainability and/or governance committee tend to engage in more impactful social and environmental activities and communicate their societal engagements more effectively. Social implications: The paper recommends that policymakers, executives and shareholders in the GCC countries support board participation among women, independent directors and formation of sustainability committees to facilitate engaging in effectual social activities. Originality/value: Empirical evidence regarding the relationship between board composition and ESG disclosure in the Gulf countries is limited. Prior literature mainly provides results on developed countries in which the governance system is mature and well structured. This study provides useful evidence regarding the Gulf countries that lack privatization and where corporate boards tend to be dominated by families and governments.

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' roles namely strategy, service and control roles and ambidextrous innovation. This study also aims to determine whether the independence and gender diversity of boards have mediating effects in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a quantitative approach, the authors conducted a survey on all Tunisian-listed firms. A partial least square method was used to analyze the quantitative data. The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of boards' members of the surveyed firms followed by a thematic analysis of the discourses to discuss the results. Findings: Results revealed that ambidextrous innovation is negatively linked to board's control role. The outcomes of this research show also that ambidextrous innovation is positively associated with board's service role and that the gender diversity moderates positively this link. Findings do not indicate a significant relationship between board's strategy role and ambidextrous innovation but show evidence that the relationship is negatively moderated by independent directors, while positively moderated by gender diversity. Originality/value: This research sheds light on the effects of Boards' roles on ambidextrous innovation and the moderating effect of board's gender diversity and independence as well. This paper addresses the gap in the literature as this thematic has not been studied, offering key insights with regard to corporate governance of companies looking to achieve ambidextrous innovation.

We test for a link between CEO power and risk taking in US banks. Banks are more likely to take risks if they have powerful CEOs and relatively poor balance sheets. There is little evidence that executive board size and independence have a dampening effect on the channels through which powerful CEOs influence risk-taking and some evidence that institutional investors reinforce the risk-taking preferences of powerful CEOs.

Although equity financing is a core value in Islamic finance, it is rarely used by Islamic banks which prefer other instruments such as markup or leasing contracts. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential determinants of equity financing. Shariah supervisory board (SSB) is regarded as crucial in promoting equity financing. We use hand-collected data on equity financing and governance structure of 88 Islamic banks in 16 countries between 2009 and 2014. Our findings reveal that Islamic banks' equity financing is influenced by the characteristics of SSB. Specifically, the duality of SSB members positively affects equity financing whereas the existence of a Shariah department within banks has a negative impact. We also find that the role of SSB in Islamic banks is influenced by the characteristics of the board of directors (BOD) and the banking environments. The impact of SSB on equity financing is reduced in the better banking environment, possibly suggesting substitution role between SSB and institutional and Islamic environment. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the impact of female directors (FDs) on investment efficiency in a competitive environment. Considering Chinese market, where corporate governance practices are weaker than other developed countries and empirical evidence regarding the role of female directors in shaping investment efficiency is absent, this study fills this gap by studying the role of the female directors in investment efficiency in a competitive environment. The results show that FDs improve the investment efficiency in the firms as they play a monitoring role, discipline the management, reduce agency problem, and improve efficient allocation of resources. The results also exhibit that FDs significantly curb the overinvestment problem. However, FDs do not play a significant role in reducing underinvestment problem. The study facilitates to understand the factors that help in efficient allocation of resources in an economy. This study can be helpful for the policymakers while devising corporate policies to promote and encourage gender diversity in higher management. (c) 2019, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.

This paper presents a methodological framework for constructing a non-parametric index of corporate governance for banks. The index is constructed by aggregating six distinct dimensional indices capturing different dimensions of corporate governance, namely board effectiveness, audit function, risk management, remuneration, shareholder rights and information, and disclosure and transparency. For aggregation, a tailored version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach which is popularly known as constrained 'Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD)' model is employed. This approach is unique and distinctive in the sense that it requires no a priori knowledge of weights, and assigns endogenous weights obtained from actual data to individual dimensions of bank governance in order to construct a composite index of corporate governance. This methodological framework has illustrated by applying it for a data set of 40 Indian banks operating in the year 2017. The data set has been compiled using 58 governance regulations as defined by relevant jurisdictions. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Given that ideological differences are likely to become an increasing source of conflict within organizations, we introduce ideological diversity as a new board-level diversity construct and hypothesize its effects on CSR performance. We hypothesize that ideological diversity can have a negative effect on CSR performance through social categorization mechanisms. Alternatively, we introduce a competing hypothesis that suggests a positive effect of ideological diversity on CSR performance through information processing mechanisms. We test our hypotheses on a panel of 372 Dutch municipality boards from 2014 to 2017 using a fixed effects OLS regression. These methods allow us to control for unobserved heterogeneity and is supported by the Hausman test we perform. Results support a negative relationship between board ideological diversity and CSR performance, indicating that a high level of ideological diversity leads to a lower performance in CSR. We discuss the implications of these findings for the board diversity and CSR literatures. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether female directors have an effect on company financial performance in a patriarchal emerging country that has a collectivistic culture with a substantial gender equality gap and is characterized with a paternalistic management culture. In addition, it aims to investigate whether the affiliations of female directors matter performance-wise in a setting where the majority of the companies are ultimately controlled by large business groups including families. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a unique hand-collected data set that covers all non-financial public companies quoted at the Borsa Istanbul between the years 2009 and 2017. To investigate the relationships between the presence and ratio of female directors and company financial performance, the current study uses the pooled ordinary least squares method, as well as the firm-fixed effects method to overcome potential omitted variables problems and various generalized method of moments methods to overcome potential reverse causality problems. Findings: The findings of the current study demonstrate that the presence and percentage of female directors both have a positive effect on company financial performance in a cultural setting where the opposite might be expected. They also present evidence suggesting that the effect becomes larger as the level of the independence of female directors becomes greater. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates that the presence of female directors on boards has a positive effect on company financial performance, even in a cultural setting that is very different from those of countries where the majority of previous studies on female directors are conducted on. In addition, it demonstrates how company financial performance varies with the level of the affiliation of female directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to reexamine the link between board racial diversity and firm performance. It focuses on the mechanism through which board racial diversity could affect performance. The paper proposes and empirically tests the role of employee productivity and R&D productivity in the relationship between board racial diversity and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a mediation analysis framework with the bootstrapping method to test both the direct and indirect effect of board diversity on firm performance. The data used in the study come from S&P 1500 with variables composed from COMPUSTAT, Institutional Shareholder Services and Wharton Research Data Services. Findings: Contrary to prior findings, the results indicate that there is neither direct effect of board racial diversity on firm performance nor is there an indirect effect through either employee productivity or R&D productivity. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used in the paper are based on large public firms, the results may not generalize to small or private firms. Practical implications: The findings of the paper suggest that not all diversity measures matter in the same way and firms should carefully make board appointments to reduce the perception that they select directors for any reason other than qualifications. Originality/value: The paper advances the literature on board diversity by examining two previously unexplored mediating variables of employee productivity and R&D productivity. It also uses more rigorous mediation analysis with bootstrapping method and a validation sample to improve robustness of the results. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Rationale: This study aims to contribute to settling the lack of consensus regarding the determinants of bank performance, not only by considering bank governance, but also by including factors such as CEO compensation and risk management committee. Previous literature has included bank governance and considered only large banks in their surveys. The exclusion of other factors such as small- and medium-size banks may render the findings of these studies limited in applicability. Objective: The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of internal governance on bank performance. Methodology: To achieve this goal, we used annual data of a sample of ten Tunisian commercial banks listed in the Tunisian Stock Exchange observed during the period 1998-2015. We use the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the parameters of our econometric model. Results: Our study finds that the correlation between the size of the board of directors, the state's inclusion, and the presence of independent directors is positive and significant. On the other hand, we have found that CEO compensation, as well as foreign and institutional investors negatively affect the performance of the banks. Conclusions and implications: Tunisian banks are invited to broaden their size through appropriate restructuring, adopt new remuneration policies and define the optimal number of directors representing the state within the board of directors. Our results suggest managerial implications that can be of great value to ensuring the success of Tunisian banks. The latter should favor a higher presence of independent directors to reduce the bank control ineffectiveness caused by having a significant number of foreign and institutional investors in the board of directors.

This work seeks to contribute to the debate about whether or not family businesses are more innovative than other kind of companies, and explore the specific effects women on boards have on innovation, comparing family and non-family businesses. Data collected from Spanish listed companies belonging to innovative sectors between 2003 and 2017 confirm that being a family business impacts positively on the number of registered patents and the proportion of women on boards exert a positive influence on R&D and patents. Moreover, the proportion of women on boards influences innovation in a different way when family and non-family businesses are compared, and depending on whether female directors belong or not to the family of control. Therefore, the results obtained suggest some relevant recommendations for research and practitioners, providing new insights into the debate on the benefits of family companies for innovation and of gender diversity of their boards.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of gender diversity among the board of directors (BOD) and Shariah supervisory board (SSB) members on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for a sample of 19 Islamic banks for the period 2010-2018 were collected to test the research hypotheses using pooled ordinary least squares estimation method. Generalized least squares estimation method was used to confirm that the results are robust. This study lagged the explanatory variables by one period to control for potential endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that Islamic banks with more gender-diverse BOD and SSB are expected to have better financial performance. In addition, this paper finds that an increase in Islamic banks' size may undermine the positive impact of gender diversity among SSB members on Islamic banks' financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only on Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to data constraints; thus, the results may not be generalizable to Islamic banks in other countries. Practical implications: Improving financial performance is crucial for banks, especially for Islamic banks, to sustain their fast-growing share globally. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to provide insight and understanding in the selection and appointment of BOD and SSB members at Islamic banks. Social implications: By having women represented in the BOD and SSB, Islamic banks will benefit equally from valuable abilities across demographic groups in the society. Furthermore, if the members of the BOD and SSB are properly selected, Islamic banks with more gender-diverse boards can effectively contribute to enhancing social welfare of various segments in the society. Originality/value: This is the first study, as far as is known to the authors, that provides empirical evidence on the influence of gender diversity among BOD and SSB members on the financial performance of Islamic banks. This paper is expected to be used as a reference by the shareholders and customers of Islamic banks in ensuring that the BOD and SSB have the best optimal composition that maximizes their profits.

Drawing on resource dependence theory and group diversity research, this paper examines how board gender and racial diversity impact corporate divestitures. We argue that due to the diverse experiences, knowledge, and perspectives that female and racial minority directors bring to the boardroom, it is more difficult and time-consuming for the board to reach a consensus and pursue a common course of action. Consistent with this argument, our results indicate that board gender and racial diversity lead to longer divestiture completion times and a lower divestiture rate. Additionally, we argue that due to their cognitive heterogeneity, diverse boards likely exchange a greater variety of information, engage in more thorough discussions, and implement greater oversight of divestitures, leading to more positive divestitures returns. Offering mixed support for this argument, we found that while gender diversity increased divestiture returns, racial diversity was associated with lower divestiture returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of women directors on US Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) value and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Archival financial and board of director data for the 1999-2019 period are collected and analyzed using panel data regression analysis. Findings: The main findings indicate that women directors' presence renders a modest positive effect on REIT performance but only when they reach critical mass on REIT boards; and that women directors have no effect at all on REIT value. Additional findings indicate that women directors are more common on REIT boards after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act but less common on boards in which the REIT founder is the chief executive officer. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first research on the effect of a gender diverse board on REIT value. It is also the first paper documenting a positive relationship between board gender diversity and REIT performance. This paper fills a research gap, as it is one of the few papers focused on gender diversity within the REITs board composition literature. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the impact of corporate governance on performance of sugar mills. In order to study this relation, a model is constructed in which ownership structure and independent directors are taken as independent variables. Whereas firm performance is analyzed by using proxy variables such as return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and sales growth. Moreover, size of board, working capital management (WCM) and philanthropy are taken as mediating variables between governance variables and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The data of 32 sugar mills listed at Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period of four years (i.e. 2014-2017) is used for this research. Moreover, to investigate the model, generalized least squares statistical method is used to measure the relationship between variables. Findings: The results revealed that there is significant but positive relationship between independent directors and ROA while ownership structure and ROE have significant but negative relationship. Thus, the board of directors should make it sure that all stakeholders and organizations should increase the nonfamily ownership in firms for better corporate performance. Moreover, philanthropy and WCM mediate the relationship between corporate governance and firms' performance. Practical/implications: This research work will be helpful in the corporate governance, and further researchers can conduct their study by considering executive/nonexecutive director and institutional owners as governance variables. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study how Corporate Governance effect the performance of firm.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

This paper aims at discovering the association between earnings management (EM) and gender diversity in boards of directors as a predictor of the corporate social performance (CSP) of non-smallmedium-sized enterprises in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The existence of a broad literature on the topic allows us to assess EM and its relations with CSR. We used an OLS regression analysis and the accrual quality measure as an EM proxy to investigate our sample of 697 Italian non-small and medium-sized enterprises. Our main results reveal that the presence of women on boards of directors results in the adoption of fewer EM practices. Therefore, our empirical findings support the notion that boardroom gender diversity as an instrument of CSP reduces the use of EM practices. The results of this paper are of most relevance to policymakers and academic communities focused on promoting CSP and CSR. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

This study aims at investigating the associations of board of directors' size, board of directors' meetings, firm size and firm leverage with firm performance among energy industry in Saudi Arabia for periods ranging from 2005 to 2018. The final sample in this study consists of 56 observations. The ordinary-least square regression shows that board size is associated positively with firm performance. Further, the results of this study repot that board meetings, firm size and firm leverage are associated negatively with firm performance in the context of Saudi Arabia. The results of this study are important for policy makers at the country and corporate levels on issues related to corporate performance. Further, the results of this study can be used in future research to gain a deeper understanding of the issues of corporate performance. (c) 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of board quality, audit quality and audit report lag on firm performance of manufactured Saudi's listed companies. The framework of the study is developed based on the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory that board quality, audit quality and audit report lag are associated with the firm performance. This study used 180 observations for the periods ranging from 2015 to 2017. The board quality is measured by two independent variables; board size and board meetings, audit quality is measured by the auditor brand name, the audit report lag is measured by the year-end to the date of the auditor's report, and firm performance is measured by the ROA and ROE. Using the pooled OLS Regression, the results show that out of four hypothesized independent variables, only audit quality has a significant and positive association with firm performance and audit report lag has a negative and significant association with firm performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to board and audit in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the quality of their board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

This study examines the effect of Islamic banks' dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on technical efficiency; and whether the effect of such governance mechanisms varies between normal times and global financial crisis period. The results show that Shariah supervisory board contributes to reducing an Islamic bank's technical inefficiency. During the GFC, both SSB governance and regular board governance generate an incremental efficiency gain to Islamic banks, but the effect is more pronounced for SSB governance. The key findings on the governance-inefficiency relationship are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity of corporate governance. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A company's board of directors plays a critical role in making decisions relating to strategy, high-level structure, and the appointment of the CEO. The role of the board and its impact on corporate performance has been well studied; however, the diversity of the board of directors and the corresponding correlation to the level of corporate innovativeness has not been previously investigated. Here, we provide a critical analysis of board members' diversity as it relates to innovative corporations in what is considered a mature industry in transition to a bioeconomy: the pulp and paper industry. Our findings contribute to the body of knowledge on the role of board member diversity in shaping company culture and how that drives, shapes, and sustains innovation. (c) 2020, The Author(s).

Managerial oversight is strengthened and firms' strategic performance improved when boards are gender-diverse. Yet the rate of women's appointment to corporate boards is decelerating. This study proposes an explanation for the unexpected attenuation rooted in social movement dynamics, particularly cross-movement influences originating from the contemporary governance reform movement. Seeking to alleviate managerialist tendencies, the governance reform movement has compelled major changes to board structure, composition, and activity, as well as the broader logic surrounding corporate boards. By definition, social movements' cognitive and structural advances manifest "spillover" effects - unintentional impacts affecting the opportunity structure, and ultimately progress, of neighboring campaigns. Drawing on social movement theory, a conceptual model is outlined explicating the mechanisms by which governance reform's broad enactments have incidentally impeded board gender diversity's advance. Theoretically-grounded strategies for reversing those effects are also outlined and the study closes with a discussion of implications for research, practice, and policy. (c) 2020

Purpose: Responding to the call for research into the behavior of family companies to provide better understanding of corporate governance, this paper aims to examine the impact of boards' effectiveness on the investment in monitoring costs (i.e. audit fees, internal audit function budget and executive remuneration) and how this relationship is moderated by family control. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 2,176 firm-year observations of Malaysian listed companies is used. The ordinary least square regression is used to examine the associations. Additional sensitivity tests are performed. Findings: The study finds that there is no relationship between boards' effectiveness and the demand for monitoring costs for the full sample. However, the findings of sub-samples (family and non-family companies) indicate that a family company with an effective board is less likely to invest more in monitoring, suggesting that the complementary association between the board's effectiveness and investment in monitoring is a more dominant relationship than the substitution relationship in non-family companies. These findings show that the boards of directors of Malaysian family companies perform a deficient monitoring role, where the presence of family controlling shareholders in management may reduce their independence and efficiency in performing their monitoring role. The findings remain robust after performing additional sensitivity tests. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance in a unique setting (family companies), where conflict of interest is created between controlling insiders and minority shareholders (Type II agency problem). It provides insight for Malaysian policymakers in assessing the issue of expropriation in family companies and enhancing the policy related to its boards. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show that social relations in a corporate governance platform between members of supervisory boards and between members of supervisory and executive board tiers can serve as an alternative viewpoint for understanding mechanisms of social selection in corporate governance networks. The study shows that through the lenses of social network analysis, it is possible to identify and understand how the process of corporate governance member selection unfolds within companies and how that selection process may have been potentially influenced by the cross-board relations, such as interlocking directorships. Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well.

This paper investigates whether firms with more effective boards have lower firm risk. We show a strong negative relationship between board effectiveness (BSCI ratings) and firm risk. Furthermore, we show that several individual components of board effectiveness are negative and statistically related to firm risk. In particular, board independence, board structure, board system and board decision-making lead to lower firm risk. Our findings have implications for firms' costs of capital that is, effective boards are likely to result in a reduction of agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control and in turn, a reduction in the overall cost of capital for firms.

Gender diversity in boards of directors has the potential to add value to the organizations that promote it. Under the premise of theories such as: agency, resource dependence or stakeholders, there have been several studies that have analysed the relationship between the number of women in the boards and the economic and financial results of the companies. However, the review of these papers allows us to obtain two clear conclusions. First, that the results are not conclusive, since positive, negative and non-significant relationships have been found between both variables. And the second, that most of these studies have been carried out on large companies listed on the Stock Exchange Market, mainly Public Limited Companies and Limited Liability Companies. In this way, this paper tries to contribute to the literature on this topic, analysing the gender diversity in the board of the Spanish agri-food cooperative societies and their influence on the profitability of the company. Specifically, 1171 cooperatives of the agri-food sector in Spain have been analysed, using statistical regression techniques. The results show that there are significant differences depending on the type of board, classifying them according to the degree of parity of each one, and the ROE and ROA profitability measures. In addition, in the case of the ROA, a positive and significant relationship is also observed between the percentage of women on the board and this variable of profitability.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

Based on the stakeholders and mass critical theories, this study analyzes the relationship between gender diversity on the board and the adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices of listed companies from Colombia and Mexico. Using a panel data composed by 477 observations during the period 2011-2016, empirical results show that the participation of women on the board increase the profitability and the international presence of the company, while the effect is negative over the leverage and environmental and social performance of the company. Nevertheless, the presence of three or more women on the board significanlty improves the CSR on the environmental and social dimensions. Similarly, the size and independence of the board enhance the CRS compliance. In this sense, the obtained results support the premise of the mass critical theory, which affirms that the presence of at least three women on the board motivates to a higher corporate performance. This research has practical implications for those responsible for issuing gender and CSR policies in Latin America.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether shareholders are convinced by earnings management. This study also explores how board gender diversity (the presence of female directors on the board) may influence the extent to which shareholders are convinced by earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate the stock market reactions to the September 11 terrorist attack using the standard event study methodology. The authors then run a cross-sectional analysis to investigate whether the market reactions are influenced by the extent of earnings management. Furthermore, the authors test how board gender diversity affects the degree to which earnings management influences the stock market reactions. Findings: The study results show that the market reactions to the attack are substantially mitigated for firms that exercise more upward discretionary accruals, implying that earnings management is successful in convincing shareholders. Additional analysis corroborates the results, including propensity score matching, instrumental variable analysis and using Oster's (2019) method for testing coefficient stability. Crucially, the authors find that board gender diversity helps shareholders see through earnings management better. The presence of female directors significantly weakens the extent to which shareholders are persuaded by earnings management. Originality/value: This study is the first to explore the effect of earnings management on shareholder wealth using the September 11 terrorist attack. The research design is less vulnerable to endogeneity and is thus much more likely to show a causal effect of accounting accruals on shareholder wealth. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Many "High-Tech" firms enjoy high market valuations despite negative earnings and low cash flows due in part to what many see as future bountiful earnings and cash flows, which is a cause for concern. How can corporate governance help? Do well-informed boards assist corporate success through better governance through their influence on financial policy: Capital Structure and Cash Holdings? We test these effects in "High-Tech firms" by segmenting firms into four levels based on technology intensity. We examine differences in board composition and the resultant influence on capital structure. Our fourteen-year sample period includes post-dotcom bubble years and post-Sarbanes-Oxley, which mandated the inclusion of financial experts on corporate boards. We defined two types of firm designated well-informed boards as a result of this analysis. We contribute to the literature in many ways. Using regression analysis and graph theory techniques, we found the educational makeup of high-tech firms to be significantly different from low-tech firms and that they approached capital structure with caution. Low-tech firms rely on board member network connectivity and agency theory's explicative powers. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This theoretical study sought to investigate the effect of corporate governance on the financial performance of commercial banks in a turbulent economic and political environment. A lot of studies in corporate governance and firm performance have focused mainly on the manufacturing and other sectors with the exclusion of the financial. The current study focuses on this neglected sector in the assessment of the effect of corporate governance on performance of commercial banks in a turbulent economic and political environment. The results from the investigation indicate that the rights of shareholders, transparency and disclosure and board operation enhance performance and eventually improve shareholders' value. The results of the research give a strong support to the idea that good governance framework is crucial in the financial sector as it positively influences firm performance. The desktop study also reveals that during times of high political volatility, the board of directors could try to make profit maximization the main goal in order to drive the bank towards making profits as the chances of making losses will be very high. This comes from the fact that the board is expected to manage all the bank's forms of risks, through both the risk management committee and the audit committee. The study scrutinized the effect of corporate governance on the performance of commercial banks. It is evident that corporate governance performs a major function in the overall growth and success of banks. The findings of this study advocate and support good corporate governance practices in commercial banks as a tool of curbing bank collapsing. (c) 2020. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates the impact of women directors on financial outcomes--return and risk of Indian companies. It applies fixed and random effects Tobit regressions to examine the effect of female directors on financial outcomes (returns and risk) of the firm, controlling promoters' shareholding, leverage, firm growth and age, board size and board meetings. The study does not find any support to agency and resource dependence theories because the proportion of women directors in most Indian boards is too small to make much impact. However, it has a moderating influence to reduce variations in accounting profits and stock returns. The investors reward also meeting the regulatory quota of woman member on the boards by higher market returns indicating a signalling effect. The study adds an understanding of quota induced women directors' influence on the firm's financial outcomes. However, the regulators should be cautious in mandating induction of women members on the boards as they might be inexperienced or lack the needed grounding to effectively influence board processes.

This study examines the influence of minority shareholders on the transfer of corporate governance practices into companies in other countries where they invest. By analysing UK firms that acquired a minority ownership in foreign firms between 1993 and 2014, we find evidence of better corporate governance in the board structure of target foreign firms following UK firms taking a minority shareholding, the extent and nature of the changes varying depending on the quality of investor protection in the country the foreign target firm is located. Our findings contribute to the on-going debates on the spillover effect of better corporate governance practices via cross-border mergers and acquisitions as well as relationship between internal (board of directors) and external (country's quality of investor protection) corporate governance mechanisms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether managerial ability affects the quality of corporate environmental financial disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: Regression analysis is used to examine the association between managerial ability and the quality of corporate environmental financial disclosures. Findings: The results of primary empirical tests find a negative association between projection errors of corporate environmental capital expenditures and managerial ability. Overall results suggest that (1) managers appear to be equally capable of making relatively accurate projections of total corporate capital expenditures, and (2) managers with higher managerial ability are capable of estimating the projection amounts that appear to be significant, yet do not deviate substantially to what they intend to spend in the subsequent year(s) for legitimation purposes. Research limitations/implications: The data collected and analyzed include only publicly traded companies in the environmentally sensitive industries in the USA; therefore, the results should not be generalized to non-US listed, private and non-publicly traded businesses. Practical implications: Results of this study provide practical implications for stakeholders in their decision-making. For instance, understanding how different levels of managerial ability affect corporate environmental disclosures quality assists the board of directors in their evaluations of the performance of current top management. Furthermore, when contemplating new laws, governmental agencies and legislators can consider how managerial ability might affect the likelihood of environmentally sensitive businesses to comply with full disclosure and other reporting requirements. Social implications: Information regarding top management's ability to carry out socially acceptable environmental practices is very valuable for investors who are interested in socially responsible and green investing. Originality/value: This study contributes to and links between two research streams: managerial ability in management literature and environmental financial disclosure literature. This is the first study that empirically tests whether the managerial ability is a determinant of the quality of corporate environmental financial disclosures. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Objectives Nowadays, the study of gender diversity in the business environment is becoming considerably relevant, due to the incorporation of women into the working life. Social advances have enabled women to leave behind their limited roles at home, and their inclusion in the labour market has gone beyond the compliance with ethics and legislation. Family firms have played a key role in the inclusion of women in the workplace, due to, among other reasons, the existence of shared roles and the overlapping of family and business values. However, and surprisingly, there are not many studies investigating the role of women in family firms. In recent years, the academic interest has been focused on gender diversity, namely on the inclusion of women on boards of directors and in top management positions. Specifically, the latest research analyses how gender diversity on boards of directors and in top management positions affects different measures of firm performance, focusing on profitability measurements. However, the obtained results so far are not conclusive at all, revealing that the presence of women on corporate governance bodies can have a positive, a negative or even a non-significant influence on firm performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is shedding some light on this controversial topic, by analysing whether the presence of women in three corporate governance bodies, i.e. the board of directors, the general meeting of shareholders and the top management team, of agri-food family firms influences the firms' economic efficiency. Methods To develop the empirical part of this study, a sample of 147 family firms pertaining to the agri-food industry has been used. The final sample was obtained from a wider study analysing the general characteristics of a representative sample of Spanish family firms. In this regard, the data presented in this article come from two different sources: on the one hand, the financial and economic data were obtained from the SABI (Sistema de Analisis de Balances Ibericos) database of Bureau Van Dijk; on the other hand, the qualitative data were obtained from the database provided by the Spanish Institute of Family Businesses and the Spanish Network of Family Business Chairs, based on a survey conducted in 2016. The proposed hypotheses were checked by performing ordinary least-squares regression analysis. Findings The obtained findings suggest that the presence of women on the boards of directors of Spanish agri-food family firms has a positive and very significant influence on economic efficiency. Moreover, the presence of women at the general meeting of shareholders also has a positive and significant influence on the firms' economic efficiency. However, the presence of women in top management teams does not exert a significant impact on economic efficiency. Contributions The present article offers several contributions to the literature. First, this study is pioneering in considering the role exerted by female directors, shareholders and managers in the economic efficiency of family firms. Although women have exerted a fundamental role within business families, their influence in the firm sphere has been very limited. In this vein, our work answers the call for further research on gender issues in family firms. Second, this study shows that gender diversity on both the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders of Agrifood family firms has a positive impact on business efficiency, revealing that women influence economic and business development. In this sense, not only is the presence of women attributed to an increase in economic efficiency, but also to an increase in social performance. Third, with regard to the agri-food industry, this study makes an important contribution at both the theoretical and the empirical level. Studies related to the agri-food industry are usually experimental studies based on comparisons and evaluations to improve production systems, as well as technical studies to achieve sustainable use of natural resources. However, there are few studies aimed at analysing the management of agri-food family firms, with special attention to the participation of a vulnerable stratum, such as women. As a fourth contribution, we have a sectored study of family firms, which allows to present more precise findings in an important industry for the society and the economy at a global level, which is the agri-food industry. Practical Implications The present work contributes to give visibility to those women present in the corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, since it reveals that female participation favours the economic and financial results of these firms. Although it is true that previous studies have analysed the effect of female presence in cooperative firms, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are not studies addressing this issue in agri-food family firms. Furthermore, from a legal perspective, this work highlights the level of influence that both the Organic Law 3/2007 of March 22nd 2007, for effective equality between women and men (BOE, 2007), and the Law 35/2011 of October 4th 2011, on shared ownership in agricultural holdings (BOE, 2011), have had on the incorporation of women in ownership and management positions in agricultural holdings. Therefore, the obtained findings in this study may be an incentive to promote the restructuring of corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, increasing the presence of women in them. Limitations The contributions of this study are no free of limitations, which, in turn, may provide opportunities for future research. First, we have focused on the economic efficiency of agri-food family firms. Thus, the obtained findings may not be applicable to other industries. However, from our point of view, it is of utmost interest to evaluate the role of women in agri-food family firms to the extent that in southern Spain the agri-food industry is especially relevant for the regional economy, as well as because the issue of gender diversity in the business environment is acquiring special interest in recent years. Another limitation of our study is that we have considered the female presence in three corporate governance bodies, even though the participation of women in any other corporate body can be beneficial to firms. A final limitation would be that the analysed family firms are located in Spain and thus, it would be necessary to determine whether different findings are obtained in other countries or regions. Originality The study of gender diversity in the business environment has emerged as a fruitful field of research in recent years, but the current knowledge regarding the influence of women on firms' outcomes is still scarce. This paper contributes to the family business literature, both in terms of corporate governance and in terms of gender, by offering some conclusions regarding the presence of women in different corporate governance bodies. Furthermore, this paper provides new research avenues that will provide a better comprehension for scholars and specialists for future investigations in the field. (c) 2020, CIRIEC.

Purpose: Considering that the heterogeneity in the composition of deliberation and management bodies can promote a differentiated impact on earnings distribution policies of companies, the purpose of this paper is to examine the marginal influence of female participation on the board of directors and executive board regarding decisions associated with dividend policy in companies operating in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is composed of non-financial companies listed on the B3 Stock Exchange between 2010 and 2015, which encompasses 261 companies (1,084 observations per year). The tests aim at explaining the probability of earnings distribution and the payout level of companies through variables that measure the female presence - considering that the explanatory economic attributes of decisions over dividends are kept under control. The econometric analysis was carried out through the descriptive analysis of the variables and LOGIT and TOBIT tests of inference estimated with fixed effects and meeting all econometric requirements. Findings: The proportion of women in both deliberative and executive bodies affects marginally the dividend policy of Brazilian companies. The female presence in management bodies contributes to a higher probability of earnings distribution and increase in the payout level; such tendency is moderated when women are in the board of directors; so, we do not reject the hypothesis of female influence on dividend policy decisions in Brazil. Originality/value: One can find such investigations in foreign environments, but such tests had not been accomplished in Brazil so far. We discuss, therefore, in an unprecedented way, the heterogeneity in deliberative (governance) and executive (management) bodies and its outcomes in strategic decisions made in Brazilian companies, focusing on the female insertion and on fundamental decisions that are related to the relationship among stakeholders, which is the dividend policy per se.

The aim of this study is to theoretically and empirically provide evidence on the association of the royal family board members, the number of board of directors and the board of director meetings with the choice of auditor for 505 non-financial listed companies in the Saudi Stock Exchange during 2012-2015. This study identifies two types of audit firms: (1) Big-4 and (2) Non-Big-4 auditors. Using pooled logic regression, this study documents the likelihood of Big 4 audit firms being associated with a company which has royal family board members, the number of board of directors and the board of director meetings. The outcomes of this study have significant implications on the issues surrounding auditor independence in the Saudi Arabian setup. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

We utilize a sample of spinoff firms that need to form a new board of directors, to shed light on the chief executive officer (CEO) influence hypothesis. We find spinoff boards with a CEO who was the parent firm CEO to be similarly structured to the boards of industry and size-matched peers, whereas spinoff boards with nonparent CEOs are structured for greater monitoring. Consistent with our board structure results, the CEO compensation and replacement decisions of parent CEO spinoff boards are more lenient toward spinoff CEOs, whereas those of nonparent CEO spinoff boards are more consistent with protecting shareholder benefits.

In this paper, by means of econometric models, we investigate the relationship between risk governance and performance of the Eurozone's Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), over the period 2014-2018. The results of the quantitative analysis show that the choice to appoint a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) can be useful to shrink the bank risk-taking. Furthermore, we find that the importance attributed by the bank to the CRO-in terms of membership of the board of directors and in terms of remuneration-is positively correlated to both profitability and bank risk-taking. In addition, the analysis shows that the activity carried out by the Risk committee can be helpful to break down the risks. (c) 2020 Sciedu Press.

By looking at the unique data set during the period from 2011 to 2015, this research presents evidence that a firm's decision to hire a tainted outside director (OD) onto its board produces significantly improved firm performance. I defined tainted ODs as ODs that are (were) senior executives at other firms where class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of an investor group that had suffered a financial loss in a stock. Especially, for the firms that appointed tainted OD as the chair of audit committee, their industry-adjusted return on assets is significantly increased by 6.8%. These results mean that under the presence of career concerns theory, tainted OD's history directly related to a previous securities class action lawsuit is a unique experience that modifies and disciplines their future behavior and eventually helps improve firm performance. Thus, through appointing tainted OD as an audit committee chair the firm might be able to reinforce the monitoring and transparency of its board, resulting in significantly better firm performance than any other control firms.

We develop a model to examine implications of empowering shareholders to replace directors. We find that shareholder empowerment functions as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can weaken ineffective boards' incentive to hold on to their position. On the other hand, it can induce both effective and ineffective boards to behave strategically to avoid a potential dismissal. As a result, empowerment does not necessarily increase firm value; in some cases, empowerment exacerbates the agency problem it is intended to address. Giving shareholders the power to set board compensation (have a "say on pay") can mitigate these problems. However, even when empowerment benefits (harms) the shareholders, firm value may decrease (increase). Finally, we discuss empirical and policy implications of the main findings. (c) CAAA

Extant research finds inconclusive evidence about the CEO horizon problem. One possible explanation is that board of directors, especially compensation committees, intervene to mitigate the CEO horizon problem. In this study, we examine whether the characteristics of board of directors and compensation committee affect their effectiveness in mitigating the CEO horizon problem. We find that retiring CEOs are more likely to reduce R&D expenditures when CEOs have more power, and director tenure is longer; retiring CEOs in firms with large board of directors and compensation committee are less likely to manage accruals.

The governance literature finds that independent directors from lending banks (commercial bank directors or CBDs) bring both financial expertise and conflict of interest between shareholders and debt holders. We examine how the presence of CBDs affects the implicit incentive of CEO turnover. Using BoardEx and DealScan data, we hypothesize and find that CBDs make the CEO turnover more sensitive to both performance and risk. Post-CEO turnover analysis reveals that firm performance improves and risk decreases in the presence of CBDs. (c) 2020 Korean Securities Association

By analyzing the literature regarding the peculiarities of the Corporate Governance (CG) structure and their impact on the companies' performance, it is possible to understand that the characteristics of the CG, especially of the Board of Directors (BoDs), strongly affect companies. Particularly, it is renowned that the diversity of members, as well as their identity, can influence the obtainable results. Among all different kinds of diversity, the gender element was chosen in the present work, because although it has been studied by several scholars, its relationship with the companies' performance still remains partially unexplored. Furthermore, other important personal characteristics of members of BoD are considered in the present study, in line with how it is represented in both organizational and professional identity theories. Starting from another work done by the authors (Tutino et al., Corporate governance, CSR and financial performances: what types of relationships exist between these dimensions? In: Corporate governance: search for the advanced practices, pp 231-240. https://doi.org/10.22495/cpr19p12, 2019), where was studied what characteristics of BoD could influence the performance, the aim of this paper is to analyze the diversity of the BoD' members, with the focus on gender, as well as to verify if in the world of "women in business," some characteristics (as knowledge, skills, personal characteristics, level of education) are determinant and influence the thought process of directors and how they make decisions, which can impact strategy formulation, therefore the performance of companies. To understand how the personal features of the members of BoD could be more perceivable regarding both the financial and CSR policies, the work is carried out using quantitative analysis on the data of the most capitalized Italian listed companies on December 28, 2018. The findings demonstrated that the ones who are more interested on the topic of sustainability inside the Board are women that have recently joined the board, whose education is in the area of engineering. On the other hand, the members that give more attention to financial performance are men that have been on the board for a long period, despite their age, who belong to the audit associate profession. The value of the present work is represented by the possibility of bridging the gap highlighted above, with reference to the relationship between the corporate governance structure and company performance. Another important aspect brought to light by this study concerns the specific characteristics of the board members that most influence strategic decisions and therefore performances.

The number of women in the boards of directors has increased in a lot of international firms, in recent years, with the help of the gender quotas, but we do not know whether this fact leads to an increase in gender equality. Based on a literature review about gender diversity, business performance, and perceived gender equality, the present research investigates if perceived gender equality is present in the Italian listed companies, which are subjected to mandatory gender quotas, analyzing if differences between men and women exist. Given the fact that almost all Italian listed companies have reached the minimum threshold imposed by the law (20%), we analyze whether and which differences exist in perceived gender equality, between men and women, using a questionnaire based on previous studies in literature review. This paper contributes to expand the empirical studies and literature review emphasizing the relevance of identifying the presence of gender equality in the Italian listed companies to a better understanding of the perceptions within the boards of directors and to the differences between the two genders.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

Our study investigates the effect of both the presence and percentage of female board directors on corporate financial performance. The main results of the study show that the presence of female directors in boards has a potential positive effect on corporate financial performance, while the percentage of females in boards has no significant effect. This result is due to the weak participation rate of females in boards of directors within the study sample, where their participation rate does not exceed 2.6%. Results of this study suggest increasing the percentage of females' participation in the board of directors because of their positive effect on the firm's financial performance. Therefore, these results might be useful for decision-makers, legislators, and policymakers in the GCC countries, who may support this by issuing regulations that support the participation of females in firms' boards of directors.

The international literature has deepened the importance of analysing the composition of BoDs in order to understand their effectiveness and efficiency. Along this path of research, this chapter aims to investigate the board diversity reviewing the main contributes developed on this topic. Specifically, the chapter illustrates the different sources in terms of diversity in the boardrooms, putting in evidence the role of regulations and institutional investors at promoting the growth of this diversity. The analysis is proposed through a cost-benefit approach, to illustrate the potential advantages and the relative risks connected to the diversity in BoDs. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

This chapter aims to set the ground, providing a brief definition of the corporate governance according to worldwide practices and focusing on the role and the functions of the board of directors. To reach this goal, a punctual review of the different theoretical frameworks coping with this topic is provided, putting in evidence the main differences as well as the principal points in common. Specifically, the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, the stewardship theory, the resource dependence theory, and the institutional theory are analysed. Moreover, the role of BoDs is analysed together with the features and the overview of "good" corporate governance practices according to existing literature and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

This study investigates the effect of gender diversity in firm's boards of commissioners and board of directors, board size, CEO gender and independent commissioners gender on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) measured by the level of CSR disclosure. The sample comprised of 130 listed manufacturing companies in 2014. Using multiple linear regressions, the result shows that the gender diversity in boards and the size of the board of directors both have a positive effect on CSR. Meanwhile, the other variables have no effect on CSR. The results imply the important role played by the corporate governance mechanism in terms of the gender diversity and board of director's size on corporate social responsibility.

In the management of agency problems, the board of directors is an essential tool for monitoring the activities of the managers. The board of directors has specific characteristics associated with its effectiveness and efficiency, which can be transformed into the general performance of the company. This study aimed at providing evidence regarding the characteristics possessed by the East Africa community companies' board of directors and their influence on the companies performance. Simultaneous system of equations and annual data from 16 companies for a period between 2003 and 2017 was used in the study. The study observed that the market performance measures to be highly influenced by the changes in the characteristics of the board such as board size, the proportion of women, proportion of independent directors and proportion of foreign directors. On the other hand, the account performance measures were less influenced by the board characteristics, and only ROE was more associated with the changes on board characteristics. During this period, the market was more overwhelmed by new information regarding the board characteristics as compared to the performance of the account measures.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines the relationship between board attributes and firm performance. In accordance with agency theory, effective board of directors plays a key role in establishing good corporate governance and enhancing firm performance by mitigating earnings management. Based on panel data set drawn from Tunisian listed firms over the period 2011 - 2017 and while using dynamic panel GMM estimator to alleviate endogeneity problems, a U-shaped relationship was found between board size, board independence and firm performance. Indeed, results show that a higher firm performance is confirmed if the board size is composed of at least 6 members and 15% of independent board members. For a robustness check, this study measures a composite score of the effectiveness of board of directors to capture the aggregate impact of board's effectiveness on firm performance. The findings of regression analysis find a significant positive relationship between the board effectiveness score and firm performance. Indeed, there is a synergy between mechanisms that act together to enhance firm performance in the Tunisian context. Copyright (c) 2020. Mejda DAKHLAOUI And Imen FREDJ.

Corporate governance has long been the subject of interest for researchers in business administration. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices decided by boards of directors are now a key issue in the decision-making process of companies. The relationship between the governance structure and CSR policies is crucial to defining the companies' strategic view. In this paper, we identify how the characteristics of corporate governance impact CSR disclosure. Our findings show that a large board of directors reduces the probability of adhering to practices that involve stakeholders more closely in company activity, while companies with more independent directors have a higher level of stakeholder protection almost by definition. Thus, there is a need for additional ways of involving stakeholders in company activity. Our results also reveal that an overlap between the roles of the CEO and the board chairman is an undesirable influence on a CSR report. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In this research, we empirically investigate the impact of the board's female representation on corporate financial and sustainability performance after the introduction of the minimum gender quotas in Italy in 2011 (Golfo-Mosca Law). We studied the 40 companies of the FTSE-MIB index for 3 years 2016-2018. Using yearly regression analysis, pooled analysis, and differential analysis, we find that the female involvement on both boards has almost no significant effect on the financial performance; however, a significant association is found with the corporate sustainability performance. The robustness checks using differential analysis confirm the later relationship in which firms that improved female representation had also an ethical score upgrade. Interestingly, we also provide that there is an optimal level of gender quotas that maximizes sustainability performance and beyond that, a negative impact on performance might be detected.

Investigating a sample of firms from the S&P 500 Index (between 2004 and 2015), the paper addresses the relationship between the representation of Women on Corporate Boards (WOCB) and the Corporate Social Performance (CSP). It adopts the instrumental variable quantile regression panel data (IV-QRPD) model, suggested by Powell (2016), to solve endogeneity and heterogeneity issues. The article shows a strong "threshold effect": the impact of board feminization on CSP is nonlinear and changes along the quantiles of the performance distribution. Highlighting a contextual and multilevel phenomenon, the paper contributes to the CG literature offering main achievements on board's dynamics and inclusiveness. (c) 2020

Boards of directors have recently become more attentive to their stakeholders' concerns, providing more transparent information and adopting more sustainable business strategies. This study investigates the influence of a critical mass of women on boards on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure score and its three components separately. Using a sample of the FTSE-MIB listed companies in the 2005-2017 period, we show that reaching a critical mass of female board members--going from one or two women to at least three--enhances the level of ESG disclosure. The results also show that the critical mass of female board members has a positive influence on every component of the ESG score, with the highest contribution of women reaching the governance score. These findings provide insights to shareholders and policymakers and suggest that a critical mass of female board members is particularly effective in improving transparency, and it can be seen as a mechanism to transit to stakeholder governance, fostering more sustainable behavior in firms.

Using conventional regressions and generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs), we examine the relationship between corporate governance (CG) and earnings management (EM). We also examine whether governance quality moderates the association between EM and CG for a sample of British and Egyptian companies. Our findings show that: (a) UK firms are likely to have lower levels of EM if they: have smaller boards, are dominated by independent outside directors, and have a low percentage of female directors; (b) Egyptian firms are likely to have lower levels of EM if they: have larger boards, are dominated by independent outside directors, and have a low percentage of female directors; (c) The governance quality (control of corruption) has a significant hidden effect on EM. Since our results provide empirical evidence that the board of directors plays a vital role in mitigating EM, these findings might lead to an improvement in the credibility of financial statements for investors in both the UK and Egypt. As policy implications, our findings inform regulators and policy-makers that corruption has a very strong hidden effect on EM and that they can deter EM by controlling the corruption level in their countries.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance. In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors' prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Management published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Academy of Management

In this paper, we show how corporate governance reforms and research have been mutually reinforcing in emerging markets and propose a research agenda going forward. Acknowledging the by now broad recognition of corporate governance as a key development driver, we show how work on corporate governance in emerging markets has led research globally by focusing on the deep issues of ownership structures, property rights and organisational forms. Using the papers presented at the latest international conference of the Emerging Markets Corporate Governance Research Network, we illustrate how analyses of board structures, specifically gender diversity, has contributed to understanding of board dynamics and informed corporate governance reforms. Considering ongoing economic and socio-political trends, we conclude with a general research agenda for corporate governance in emerging markets. (c) 2020

The purpose of this research is to synthesise and critically evaluate the extant literature investigating the role of board of directors as a core element of corporate governance in corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Adopting a systematic review approach, a sample of 67 studies from 18 highly regarded scholarly journals published between 1992 and 2020 is examined. Distinguishing between two board attributes of director characteristics and board structures, our study uncovers similarities and inconsistencies regarding the effects of various board characteristics and board structures on CSR performance. First, our study reveals that these attributes do not work in isolation but interact with each other and the context in which they are embedded in shaping CSR performance. Additionally, our review identifies substantial variation in conceptualisations, theoretical frameworks, the use of measurements and the contexts across studies providing a basis to offer a comprehensive synthesis of dominant scholarly discourses and an organising lens for future scholarship.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether the board of directors (BoD) diversity affect corporate social performance (CSP), an alternative measure of corporate performance based on social outcomes. The article distinguishes between a structural diversity of boards (proxied by director independence), and a demographic diversity in boards (proxied by gender diversity) and our concept of CSP. The sample is constituted of the firms listed to the FTSE-MIB index, which comprehends the most Italian capitalized listed firms. The analysis, covering a ten-year period (2010-2019), provides evidence that independent directors positively affect CSP and that gender has no effect on CSP. We also tested the association between BoD and CSP separately for family firms (FFs) and non-family firms (NFFs) to investigate whether FF status is a contingent condition modifying the effect of board features on CSP. Our result provide evidence of it. (c) 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Empirical evidence suggests that the effect of board gender diversity on firm performance remains inconclusive. We argue that, during the times of crisis, firms likely need more monitoring and different advice than they normally do, thereby highlighting the role of female directors, who bring new ideas and different perspectives to the table. Consistent with this argument, the results show that the presence of female directors on the board significantly improved firm performance during the Great Recession of 2008, but such benefits from board gender diversity are not found outside the crisis period. In particular, during the Great Recession, an increase in the percentage of female directors by one standard deviation is associated with a rise in the return on assets of 8.41%. Several robustness checks confirm the results, including an instrumental-variable analysis and a dynamic panel generalized method of moments. There is also evidence that the beneficial role of female directors during the crisis is not sufficiently reflected in the stock markets. (c) 2019 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2019

Prior research documents that information transmitted via director networks affects firms' policies and real economic activities. Given a manager's potential monopoly over firm information, it is important to analyze whether information transmission through director social networks undermines the manager's control. Specifically, we explore whether information flow through director networks influences managers' ability to hoard bad news. We predict and find that the extent of external connections of the board of directors is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Additional analysis implies that this evidence is driven by firms with more powerful executives, with weaker auditor monitoring, or subject to strong investor protection, and by directors with greater monitoring incentives or responsibilities and directors with less firm-specific knowledge. Collectively, our research lends empirical support for the monitoring view under which better-informed directors narrow the scope for bad news hoarding evident in stock price crash risk. In another series of tests, we fail to find evidence consistent with the information leakage view under which directors pass sensitive firm-specific information to connections that trade on the information before its public release. Other analysis helps dispel the concern that the endogenous match between directors and companies is spuriously responsible for our core results. Our empirical findings have important implications on how social networks affect the proper functioning of capital markets. (c) CAAA

The literature on gender diversity in boards of directors has expanded significantly in recent years, due to the fact that women are increasingly holding higher management positions within the company hierarchy, clearly demonstrating that certain characteristics of women have a positive impact on different areas within the company. The objective of this paper is to analyze scientific articles on the presence of women in boards of directors, based on a literature review, in order to learn about the evolution of this concept over time. The search conducted for this paper produced 300 documents from the Web of Science, with a final total result of 168 documents after passing the initial results through various filters. VOSviewer software was used to analyze the information, which enabled the creation of bibliometric citation, co-citation and co-word maps. The results reveal the most relevant authors and studies on this subject and identify the most current studies, the main topic of which deals with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in addition to highlighting the characteristics of women that are of vital importance to boards of directors within the current context: empathy, open innovation, concern for the needs of interest groups and a heightened perception of risks.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand the circumstances under which board behavior is affected by gender diversity. The "reasoned action approach" is used as a lens through which to assess the extent that the behavior of the board varies with its gender diversity. Research Findings/Insights: The study uses archival data from a panel sample of 80,395 directorships observed between 1998 and 2012. Boardroom gender diversity is significantly related to director personal responsibility (board attendance), CEO accountability, and risk taking. Our findings highlight the key importance of the exposure of male directors to women directors on boards beyond the focal board. This suggests a positive externality or a spillover effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The empirical findings of this study highlight the importance of allowing for the operation of social norms when studying boardroom decision making. Experience gained by male directors of working with women directors on other boards, beyond the focal board, is shown to enable women directors to contribute more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers encouragement to policy makers' intent on increasing the presence of women on corporate boards. These results point to a spillover effect: there is an observed impact of women on boards that acts not only directly on the board on which they sit but also through the network of boards on which their male counterparts sit.

Previous studies show regulation and corporate governance play an important role in affecting CSR processes and outcomes. The stakeholder engagement (SE) process represents a good practice of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and, at the same time, an aspect of substance over form, within the CSR policies. In spite of its relevance, SE represents a little explored field of research. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if the improvements in SE processes are actually driven by regulation rather than by some elements of corporate governance. The study examines the effect of the regulation and some board's characteristics on SE. Specifically, in 2017 the introduction of EU non-financial information Directive (Directive 2014/95/EU) shifts the disclosure of non-financial information from the voluntary to the mandatory realm: in this mandatory context, the quality of the SE process that is indirectly disclosed in non-financial information, could improve. By using a content and statistical analysis, through performing 4 two-way Analysis of Variance, the study reveals that the effects of the introduction of the Directive 2014/95/EU on the stakeholder engagement process have been limited and the improvements in SE before and after the introduction of the Directive link to the Board of Directors characteristics. These findings are interesting for academics, by enriching the academic debate on mandatory versus voluntary disclosure and the relationship between board attributes and sustainability, for policy makers, by providing suggestions to favour organisational change of the firms, and for managers, by identifying the desirable characteristics of the Board of Directors.

Does the appointment of more women and ethnic minority directors on corporate boards help combat discriminatory work environments? This empirical study addresses this question by exploring the occurrence of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Drawing from social identity theory and empathy-based perspectives, we propose that a greater presence of female and minority directors on boards reduces the likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits given their propensity to advocate for underrepresented groups in the workplace. Our analysis of data from 452 US firms from 2010-2015 indicates that a higher proportion of female and minority directors on boards is associated with a lower likelihood of such lawsuits. Specifically, the likelihood of such lawsuits is lower where there are three or more (a critical mass) female and minority directors. "Token" appointments (one or two female or minority directors) do not reduce the occurrence of these lawsuits. Further, the joint presence of minority and female directors on boards significantly reduces the likelihood of such lawsuits. Finally, we found that female CEOs help in reducing the occurrence of such lawsuits when the board has two or more female directors. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of greater gender and ethnic diversity on boards in combating workplace discrimination. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the relationship between women's participation on the board of directors and the company's financial performance in a sample of 45 Colombian companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange (CSE) (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia). Design/methodology/approach: Using 50,214 financial records of 45 companies listed on the CSE during 2008-2016, the authors performed panel data regressions to explore the relationship between the measures of gender diversity on boards and the impact on corporate financial performance. Findings: The authors show that the participation and presence of at least one woman on the board of directors are positively associated with firm financial performance as measured by return on equity (ROE), but not as measured by Tobin's Q. This second indicator is positively associated with firm financial performance when there are at least three female directors on boards of 10 or more individuals. Practical implications: The findings also provide evidence supporting the development of managerial and organizational mechanisms that strengthen female presence at the highest level of governance. Originality/value: The study demonstrates that female presence on boards has a positive impact on firms' financial performance, but the degree of diversity impacts differently ROE and Tobin's Q. These findings are based on a study of an emerging economy in Latin America, and data on similar economies are scarce. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

Purpose: This study aims to intend to check if female board representation affects performance and risk and to analyse the evolution of the demographic aspects of the presence of women on boards in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a sample of 150 Brazilian publicly traded companies from 2010-2018, with different measures of firm performance, firm risk and women's presence on the board. The study approach is based on a set of ordinary least squares, quantile and panel data regressions. Findings: The presence of women on the board has a positive effect on all of our accounting and market performance measures. However, the result of the impact on risk is not conclusive. The study also found that the number of females on the board has a more significant effect at the lower levels of firm performance measured by return on equity, but at the higher levels when measured by Tobin's Q. Regarding return on assets, the more significant effect happened on the extremes of the performance distribution. The study findings point that market investors place more value in female presence on the board than in director positions. Originality/value: By estimating the impact of women's presence on the boards of directors in firm performance and risk, this study aimed to verify this impact in different aspects of the company. In addition, the authors did so in a sample with many years, making it possible to evaluate the historical evolution of the feminine presence in the boards of administration as well as in the groups of directors, assisting Brazilian legislators with new evidence about the possible impacts of Draft Law 7179/2017.

Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the debate on the relationship between board diversity and performance, a hot topic for scholars and shareholders. A number of studies have found contrasting impacts of board diversity on firm performance and this paper adds new and original evidence in the context of the automotive supply chain focusing on gender, age and nationality diversity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a triple stage empirical analysis. First, the authors use linear models according to different performance indexes for investigating diversity (gender, age and nationality) within the board of directors and executives. Second, the authors investigate the issue of diversity in different contexts such as position in the supply chain, nationality of the owner and family/corporate ownership. Finally, the authors use non-linear models to find a better combination of diversity in terms of gender and nationality for retrieving some managerial implications. Findings: First, the authors demonstrate a robust positive effect of women in board representation on firm performance in terms of profitability and firm risk. In the case of, age and nationality the results are more equivocal in particular for the former. Second, the authors depict board diversity in different contexts as follows: positioning in the supply chain, type and nationality of the final owner. Again, gender heterogeneity is more adequate in the complex firm as Tier 1 suppliers, corporate and foreign company. Originality/value: The authors focused the analysis on a specific industry, shedding light on the main specificities linked to operating in certain phases of the supply chain, a substantial novelty in this field. The empirical evidence is based on a very large data set containing quantitative and qualitative information on a representative sample of 1,538 firms operating in the Italian automotive supply chain, one of the most relevant in Europe.

This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency.

Purpose: This study sheds light on the determinants related to the corporate board of directors and the firms' ownership nature of tax aggressiveness strategies of Tunisian listed firms and what could be their effect on its level in a postrevolution context. Design/methodology/approach: Our research considers only nonfinancial firms listed in the Tunisian stock exchange during the 2011-2017 period. It is based on unbalanced panel data. Findings: Findings suggest that women presence on the corporate board, CEO duality, the managerial and institutional ownership regularize significantly the level and the management's behavior of engagement in tax aggressiveness practices and reduce the firm's overall risks of its consequences in terms of tax positions stability. Research limitations/implications: Our investigation considers only nonfinancial firms to avoid noisy results and for the significant differences between accounting standards within financial and nonfinancial firms, besides sample homogeneity and comparability considerations. Practical implications: This study provides evidence that some governance mechanisms, even reasonably dedicated to consider the risk of tax aggressiveness and to prevent its consequences, have a paradoxical effect and amplify the tax aggressiveness' level rather than defending the firm's viability and its financial stability. It offers signals to managers about specific governance attributes that strengthen and/or control the extent of tax aggressive strategies. Social implications: This research gives a particular road map for society, investors and practitioners to depict the firms' level of tax aggressiveness and especially to understand its attributes related to the corporate board of directors and the ownership's nature through evidences from a postrevolution context. Originality/value: Our research contributes to prior literature by examining the effect of corporate board characteristics and different ownership natures on the extent of tax aggressiveness during and after the revolution period in Tunisia and confirms and infers some prior findings of tax aggressive determinants in underdevelopment context.

The current study investigates whether board age diversity affects company financial performance and risk, and whether diverse work-related values held by directors of different ages are the underlying cause of any effects via a sample of listed companies from Turkey, which has a collectivistic and paternalistic culture. In order to investigate these effects, various 2 Stage Least Squares Instrumental Variables models are employed. In addition, to investigate through which channels age diversity may affect company performance, directors' personal values are also considered via propensity score matching. Even though directors' values are not observable, it is assumed that their ages reflect their values. For this purpose, the current study utilizes the World Value Survey data. The findings suggest that board age diversity has a positive effect on both company performance and risk, but do not suggest that intra-group conflicts in terms of work-related values are the underlying causes of this positive effect.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the relationship between audit partner and firm industry specialization and board of director independence on the decision by Taiwanese firms to use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) flexibility concerning reporting interest income and expense and dividends received in different sections of the statement of cash flows. This flexibility existed in Taiwan for the first time in 2013, the year that Taiwan switched from its own generally accepted accounting principle to IFRS. Design/methodology/approach: Using 2013 data for a sample of 1,227 firms, 354 of whom changed their reporting classification, this study examined the interaction effect of board independence and partner-level and firm-level auditor industry specialization on the cash flow reporting decision using logistic regression. Findings: The results show there is a substitute relationship between board independence and partner-level industry specialization on the change in cash flow reporting classification, but a complementary relationship between board independence and firm-level auditor specialization. Further, both partner-level and firm-level auditor industry specializations have a complementary (but negative) relationship with board independence as to whether the firm is likely to report interest expense paid in the operating or financing activities sections. Practical implications: An important implication is that knowing the levels of audit firm and partner specialization and how independent the board is, is useful for researchers and regulators in investigating auditor-client relationships and understanding the influences of variables investigated here on the outcome(s) of accounting policy and regulatory changes. Originality/value: This study improved the field's understanding of the impacts of audit partner and firm specialization, board independence and relevant interactions on cash flow reporting choices.

We investigate the role of culturally diverse board of directors on firm outcomes in China. We examine whether the diverseness of the educational, professional and cultural backgrounds of board members influences firm innovation. We find that firms whose directors have international experience are more innovative. In addition, the positive cultural diversity effect is more pronounced for returnee directors with postgraduate and science-related degrees, and longer international work experience. Further, the directors who gain international experience from the countries with higher standards of management practice, corporate governance and intellectual property rights protection have a higher impact on corporate innovative activities.

Drawing on the notion of "faultlines" and the upper echelons perspective, we argue that the gender faultline strength of a board of directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly, while gender faultline strength negatively relates to strategic change under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for the hypotheses. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

This paper examines the impact of the gender and ethnic composition of corporate boards (board of directors and audit committee) on stock liquidity in the context of South Africa. More specifically, we focus on the interaction effects of gender diversity and ethnic diversity on stock liquidity. Using a sample of listed South African firms for the period 2009-2013, we find that firms with more female or black directors on corporate boards are associated with a higher level of stock liquidity. However, the interaction effect indicates that the positive impact of ethnic diversity on stock liquidity is attenuated with the greater presence of gender diversity. These findings are explained through board effectiveness and corporate information flows. (c) 2020 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand

The literature investigating corporate governance (CG) disclosure has predominantly stressed the monitoring role of the board of directors, analysing the association between information about the board's independence and firm market performance. Drawing from managerial studies, the governance literature has recently recognized corporate performance is affected by a wider set of directors' personal traits. However, CG reporting does not currently require disclosure of most of these characteristics. We believe knowledge of directors' personal traits is valuable for investors if these characteristics are indicators of company performance. Drawing on a sample of listed Italian family firms, we embrace a wide set of hand-collected information that captures directors' profiles to verify their association with Tobin's Q. Even if such associations are casual, we infer that information about board members' profiles beyond CG report disclosures is useful for market participants. The results from the regression analyses show that information about directors' personal details, educational backgrounds, and work experience in specific professional areas is predictive of market performance, and that the market evaluates board members' personal information that is currently ignored in CG reports. The study offers practical contributions to standard setters, highlighting the need to extend CG reporting requirements for directors' personal profiles. Further, the evidence contributes to drawing the attention of preparers and users to board of directors' profile information that is currently not disclosed in CG reporting.

This study examines the effect of board of directors' expertise and tax avoidance on corporate debt. We find that there is no association between financially expert outside directors on the board and corporate debt, which is contrary to some prior research findings. However, we do find a positive association between the proportion of financially expert inside directors on the board and debt. We also find that the debt substitution effect is significantly intensified by the presence of outside directors on the board with financial expertise, which suggests that the advice offered by these directors better informs managers to make decisions about the trade-off between the benefits and costs of debt and non-debt tax shields. We find no such effect for inside directors. Overall, this study extends the literature on corporate governance, tax avoidance and corporate debt.

This research investigates the relationship between fat cat firms and crash risk. Our empirical results find that under industry fixed effects, fat cat firms are positively associated with stock price crash, demonstrating that a self-interested board of directors leads to a serious agency problem. We find consistent results after we control for other types of fat cat firms, sample selection bias, endogeneity problem and use different measurements of crash risk. Finally, we also report that under the within-firm scenario, the more frequently firms are listed as fat-cat firm announcements, the worse agency problem it encountered, which causes fat cat firms to have higher crash risk.

Purpose: This study aims to discuss the determinants of Islamic banks' efficiency. It tries to explore the source of Islamic banks' inefficiencies to propose solutions to guarantee an acceptable level of technical efficiency of such banks in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this objective, the authors use a parametric approach, especially, the stochastic frontier approach, using production function and panel data analysis. The authors apply a package Frontier 4.1 for the estimation process, which is composed of two principal steps. In the first step, the authors estimate Islamic banks' efficiency scores in different GCC countries based on an output distance function. In the second step, the analysis highlights the impact of managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance, scarcity of Shari'ah scholars, the board independence and chief executive officers' (CEOs) duality on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Findings: This study's results document that managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance and the board of directors' composition, especially, the board's independence, can largely explain the technical efficiency scores of Islamic banks in GCC countries. Especially, the authors find evidence that managerial-specific education is negatively associated with the inefficiency term. The coefficient of the Shari'ah scholar's variable has a positive sign indicating that the more there are Shari'ah experts, the more the bank is efficient. In addition, CEOs' duality seems to have no significant effect on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Practical implications: GCC Islamic banks need to improve the presence of independent members on the board of directors. In addition, these banks are invited to count more on Shari'ah auditors and educated staff characterized by a high level of competency in the domain of Islamic banking and finance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that highlights the effect of managerial-specific education in Islamic accounting and finance and scarcity of Shari'ah scholars on Islamic banks' efficiency.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

This study investigates a communication game between a CEO and a board of directors where the CEO's career concerns can potentially impede value-increasing informative communication. By adopting a policy of aggressive boards (excessive replacement), shareholders can facilitate communication between the CEO and the board. The results are in contrast to the multitude of models which generally find that management-friendly boards improve communication, and help to explain empirical results concerning CEO turnover. The results also provide the following novel predictions concerning variation in CEO turnover: (1) there is greater CEO turnover in firms or industries where CEO performance is relatively more difficult to assess; (2) the board is more aggressive in their replacement of the CEO in industries or firms where the board's advisory role is more salient; and (3) there is comparatively less CEO turnover in firms or industries where the variance of CEO talent is high.

In their pursuit to garner resources and support for their IPO, the issuing firms prepare well on all fronts. Corporate governance, specifically board structures, is a critical issue that affects the decision quality and also influences the investors' psyche. Building on theories of agency, resource dependency and signaling, this article attempts to study the effects of presence of foreign directors on firm-specific and board-related characteristics of IPO issuing firms. Adding to the scant literature on national diversity, this study concludes that foreign directors do signal a firm's intent of internationalization and contribute to strengthening corporate governance but national diversity does not translate into IPO returns. Exploring a sample of Indian IPOs issued from April 2001 to March 2017, this study finds that presence of foreign directors on the boards brings about differences in governance mechanisms wherein internationalized boards were found to be stronger on governance front. Larger boards, more committees, less number of related directors, better board interlocking were the benefits that manifested from presence of foreign board members. Issue size and issue price of shares at the time of IPO are found to be significantly higher for firms with foreign directors on their boards reflecting better acceptance among the investors.

Prior research has found that characteristics of the audit committee influence the incidence of financial restatements, as does demographic diversity on boards of directors. We draw upon work team diversity research to examine the impact of relations-oriented and task-oriented diversity in the audit committee on the likelihood of fraud-related and error-related financial restatements, respectively. We argue that these two types of demographic diversity work differently through greater vigilance of the audit committee in reducing the occurrence of financial restatements. Using a matched sample of fraud-restatement, error-restatement and non-restatement U.S. firms between 1996 and 2010, we find that relations-oriented diversity is associated with a lower incidence of fraud-related restatements, while task-oriented diversity is associated with a lower likelihood of error-related restatements. We also find that the involvement of audit committee members on other board committees moderates these relationships. We discuss the important role of work team diversity mechanisms in evaluating the effectiveness of board audit committees. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We investigate whether female presence on firms' board of commissioners and board of directors is associated with a higher dividend policy. Using panel data on 525 publicly listed firms in Indonesia between 2011 and 2018, we find that the impact of females' presence on firms' boards on dividend policy depends on their role as either an executive or a non-executive on the boards. Female directors are negatively associated with cash dividend payments, while female commissioners are positively associated with dividend payments in the case of only family-controlled firms. Our results provide insights into corporate governance practices in a two-tiered board system in a developing country. (c) 2021 PBank Indonesia Institute. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to bridge the gap in the scarce and inconclusive literature concerning the impact of gender diversity on earnings quality by positioning this relationship within an institutional context. It aims to investigate the moderating effect of different cultural dimensions and accounting values on the relationship between board gender diversity and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an international sample from 46 countries (3,092 public firms) for the year 2017. A two-level hierarchical linear regression model is used to test the moderating effect of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and Gray's accounting values on diversity and accruals quality relationship. Findings: The findings suggest a positive relationship between board gender diversity and earnings quality. Results hold valid after controlling for endogeneity effect. More importantly, regarding national culture, results indicate that power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, professionalism, uniformity, secrecy and conservatism moderate the relationship between female directors and accruals quality. Furthermore, different levels of female representation are essential on boards of different societies to use the benefits of gender-diversified boards in enhancing earnings quality. Research limitations/implications: The study provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of various worldwide movements toward increasing board gender diversity. Additionally, the results speak directly to gender quota regulatory bodies suggesting that "no size fits all" for gender quota requirement. Originality/value: The study contributes to the stream of literature concerning gender diversity and earnings quality by investigating this relationship through the lens of national culture and emphasizing the importance of considering institutional factors in examining social interactions.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We survey non-executive directors in emerging markets to obtain detailed information about the inner workings of corporate boards across a variety of institutional settings. We document substantial variation in the structure and conduct of boards as well as in directors' perceptions of the local legal environment. Our analysis indicates that directors who feel adequately empowered by local legislation are less likely to vote against board proposals. They also form boards that play a stronger role in the company's strategic decision-making. The evidence suggests that a supportive legal environment allows directors to focus more on their advisory role rather than on their monitoring role. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the effects of a board's diversity on firm financial performance using a sample of 76 companies listed on FTSE100 over the period 2010-2015. This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. (c) 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

Research Question/Issue: Do enforcement actions impact banks' board composition? Based on a unique sample of sanctions imposed on Italian banks by the country's banking supervisory authority from 2009 to 2015, we investigate whether supervisory enforcement actions affect changes at the board level. Moreover, we examine whether changes at the board level after a sanction are effective in reducing the probability of further sanctions in the future. Research Findings/Insights: The findings reveal that sanctioned banks change their board composition following a supervisory sanction. We further test whether these changes improve bank governance and find that, under certain conditions, they may reduce the probability that the board is sanctioned again. Robustness tests confirm the results. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical evidence that supports the role of supervisory enforcement actions in inducing banks to adopt changes at the board level. Given that the relationship between supervisory sanctions and changes in board characteristics is still neglected, we contend that our results may increase the understanding of the effectiveness of enforcement actions in improving board characteristics. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We believe that our results have policy implications by making a clear and concrete contribution to the ongoing debate on the revision of the principles for enhancing corporate governance and banking supervision.

Recent corporate governance scandals have been attributed to a lack of board independence because of the influence CEOs have over their boards. However, CEOs can also affect board efficacy without compromising its independence by strategically choosing directors. We offer a theoretical framework to examine how CEOs can strategically choose director characteristics (such as expertise and skill set) to influence the inner workings of the board. We examine how director expertise affects the board's equilibrium voting strategies and show that some "passivity" on the part of directors can in fact be desirable equilibrium behavior. More importantly, we show that managers can strategically appoint independent outside directors to influence board voting in their favor. Surprisingly, contrary to what we might expect, we find that opportunistic (principled) managers may not always appoint the least (most) able directors to the board. We also examine whether CEOs would prefer a "captured" board (i.e., an insider-dominated board) and show that the value of director input (i.e., the board's advising role) and the financial markets can discourage CEOs from pursuing such appointments.

Using a sample of 47 Portuguese and Spanish firms for the period 2010 to 2017, the authors study the relationship between female presence on board and firm's accounting (ROA and ROE) and market-based (MTB and Tobin's Q) performance. They find that women on the board of directors is positively related to firm's performance, as well as the gender of the CFO and the proportion of women on the listed key professionals, when we consider the market measures of performance, not being so consistent for accounting performance measures. Results were sensitive to the performance measure used. The results reinforce the political options of European Commission gender established quotas, revealing that in the Iberian countries these quotas are not being effectively implemented, even if results suggest that women on board in fact exert positive influence over market performance. This also led us to think that financial markets may also react in a positive way when the CFO of the company is a woman instead of a man, despite the sample limitations both in terms of gender and number of firms.

The chapter analyzes female involvement in medium-sized family businesses in Central Italy. The empirical analysis focuses on 233 firms over the period 2007-2014, to understand how female representation in corporate governance has evolved in recent years, and to pinpoint the factors tending to encourage/discourage female involvement in the board of directors. A descriptive analysis was conducted, enabling a fuller understanding of how female involvement in governance roles has evolved over the years. A regression analysis was performed to determine if and how specific governance characteristics - such as family ownership and generational stage - may have a bearing on the female presence on the board. The results confirm that female representation is favorably influenced by a strong family presence in the ownership of the business, while family firms under first-generation control exert a negative influence on female involvement.

We investigate the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and environmental performances of firms. Our central focus is the extent to which a country's economic status (developed, developing) can shape such a relationship. We find evidence that gender diversity is positively correlated to environmental performances of firms. Interestingly, this correlation is not only stronger in developing countries but also increasing in gender diversity. These findings have considerable importance in terms of policy. Promotion of gender diversity in developing countries, where abatement costs are the lowest, would improve global environmental quality in a costeffective way. This is best achieved through building institutions and strengthening them. The benefits of such policy go beyond developing countries frontiers, particularly when global environmental problems (pollution, global warming, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, etc.) are concerned. These benefits can be a leverage for an efficient implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) both as gender diversity stands as a goal by itself and also because it facilitates achieving other environmental-related SDGs.

Board models like the one-tier board, as used in the US and the UK, or the two-tier board, as used in Germany, provide a basic governance structure that enables the use of specific governance strategies. It is the use of specific governance strategies, not the choice of a board model, which determines the role of the board in alleviating agency problems between owners and managers, controlling and non-controlling shareholders, and shareholder and stakeholder constituencies. Based on this finding, the choice of the suitable board model should be left to private parties. The market for corporate control is known as a removal strategy that alleviates the agency problem between owners and managers of potential target companies. To achieve this effect, it must be ensured that takeover defenses are taken in the interest of shareholders rather than to shield the incumbent board from removal by the acquirer. The governance options include focusing board structure through the allocation of decision-making power to independent directors in the US or to the supervisory board in Germany, and, as an alternative, reinstalling shareholder decision-making, thus removing the board from its coordination task in the UK. Counter-intuitively, one might group US and German law together, despite differences in basic structure and the adoption of UK control shift regulation by the European Union.

This study aims at identifying the determinants of gender diversity and nationality diversity in the boards of Vietnamese listed firms. The data are hand-collected from 257 companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange (HOSE) and 214 companies listed on the Ha Noi stock exchange (HNX) in the period 2015-2017. The main analyzing methods include Pooled OLS, REM, FEM, and GMM. The research results show that gender diversity is determined by three factors, industry, family firm, and board size. Concerning the determinants of nationality diversity of the board, there is evidence that firm size, foreign ownership, state ownership, and proportion of foreign sales predict the nationality diversity. Based on these results, some administrative implications are proposed to improve the structure of the board, including expanding business scale, promoting exports, limiting the increase in the number of members on the board of directors, reducing state ownership, and increasing foreign ownership.

The board of directors' diversity plays a crucial role in the firm's decision-making process, which includes risk management. This study proposes a multidimensional index to measure board diversity. We use the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 between 1996 and 2013 to analyse the relationship between board diversity and credit risk. We find an inverse and significative relation between board diversity and credit risk, which means that diversity matters in credit risk, and more diversity leads to less credit risk.

The aim of this research is to investigate the corporate governance frameworks of listed Swiss bank, to evaluate their performance across several indicators and identify strengths and weaknesses of their internal guidelines and code of best practice. More specifically, we use the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, the Basel Committee Guidance on Corporate Governance for Banks and the Swiss Code of Best Practices for Corporate Governance to develop a framework to evaluate the corporate governance of Swiss banks relative to factors such as board structure, board composition, transparency, compensation and risk management To meet the aim of the research, we collect qualitative data from publicly available yearly reports, corporate governance documents and codes of conduct from a sample of listed Swiss banks. We find that, overall, Swiss banks have a sound corporate governance framework. However, board gender diversity is low. Also, there are differences between smaller and bigger banks in board composition. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the corporate governance structure of listed Swiss banks and they can be a useful tool for the banks, which can use our findings to implement enhancements to their corporate governance frameworks.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

In this paper, the effect of gender diversity in board and independent audit teams on banks' earnings management behavior (EMB) is analyzed. I use the data of a sample of 308 firm-year observations that comprise of Turkish banking sector from 2003 to 2018, which is analyzed using panel least squares regressions. First, the null EMB of banks which operate in Turkey is tested. The relative effect of gender differences in the board of directors-BoDs and the independent audit teams on EMB is tested. Gender differences are proxied by the gender of the CEO (chief executive officer), the ratio of female members in the BoDs, and the gender of the lead auditor. The results reveal that banks manage earnings by using loan loss provisions. After testing EMB, gender effects are analyzed and implications are made. According to the results, the gender of both the CEO and the lead auditor has a significant effect on EM of behavior of the banks. The accrual level is higher, and EM behavior is constrained for companies audited by female lead auditors or female CEO board members. The multiple regression results of whole gender effects are mixed. The paper finds evidence of the mitigating effect of CEO's and lead auditor's gender on EMB. However, the evidence reveals that the board's female members' ratio is not associated with a propensity for earnings management. Results of the integrated analysis show that companies of which audited by female lead auditors and executed by male CEOS have higher loan loss provisions level that reverses the EMB of banks operating in Turkey.

As a key part of the fourth industrial revolution, technology companies have become the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Surprisingly, however, these companies have been overlooked by studies of gender diversity in corporate governance even though their highly distinctive features may cause major differences in gender diversity with respect to companies in other sectors. The goal of this chapter is therefore to provide the first characterization of gender diversity in the corporate governance of large technology companies--specifically those with the highest market value--and explore the relationship between gender diversity and business performance. To achieve this goal, descriptive statistical analysis is used. Data correspond to the period 2005 to 2017. The findings confirm the under-representation of women on the boards of directors of 162 publicly listed companies. The findings also show that the most profitable companies are those that have the greatest female rep-resentation on their boards of directors. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Using a sample of GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) listed companies for the period 2012 to 2018. This paper aim is to investigate the association between higher board education and firm performance by applying the OLS method. The results documented a significant negative association between board higher education and firm performance. This means higher educated directors' knowledge might be the barrier to enhancing firm performance. (c) 2021 IEEE.

The supervisory role the board of directors is an essential corporate governance control mechanism, particularly in countries where external mechanisms are not well developed. The composition of the board based on gender can affect the quality of this supervisory role and thus the financial performance of the firm. While some national capital market regulators, such as UK, Germany and Australia, have introduced recommendations and disclosure requirements, other countries, such as Norway, Spain and France, have by legislation a minimum requirement of women's participation in a company's board of directors. While the matter of board gender diversity has captured researchers' attention in recent years, most empirical results use US data. The present paper attempts to contribute to the growing literature of non-US studies investigating the link between gender diversity in the board and firm financial performance by focusing on the UK. We use panel data analysis and find that gender diversity--as measured by the percentage of women on the board and according to two indices--has a positive effect on firm value. That means that it is the balance between women and men that UK companies should focus on instead of merely the presence of women since the latter alone does not have any impact on firm performance. Our study also suggests that investors in the UK do not penalize firms which increase their female board membership and that greater gender diversity can generate economic gains.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices affect corporate financial performance (CFP) indicators at Turkish listed companies. The impact of ESG disclosures on the firm-level CFP of companies listed on the Borsa Istanbul Corporate Governance Index (XKURY) over the period 2007-2017 is investigated using the corporate governance principles of the Capital Markets Board and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) environmental indicators. The contribution of this study is that it explores the influence of twenty independent ESG variables, comprising company disclosures, on CFP in an emerging market. The results of the study reveal a negative effect of environmental disclosures on CFP. Stakeholder involvement in management contributes to operational efficiency in the social dimension of ESG. Provisions related to shareholder rights and the board of directors has a positive impact on CFP in the governance dimension. (c) 2021 The Authors

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Design/methodology/approach: From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016-2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies' websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis. Findings: The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a company's decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)' global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairman's independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision. Research limitations/implications: The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies' decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers. Practical implications: The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairman's independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms. Social implications: Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure. Originality/value: The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies' social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.

Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n = 61 boards, n = 315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties. (c) 2021 The Author(s)

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

This paper explores the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting and financial performance and the moderating effect of board gender diversity on that relationship. Using a panel data set consisting of a sample of French companies listed on the SBF 120 during the period 2008-2015, we find a neutral effect from CSR reporting using Tobin's Q variable to measure performance, whereas a negative effect is observed with the ROA variable as a performance measure - findings that support the trade-off hypothesis. We also find that CSR reporting enhances corporate financial performance through the positive moderating role of gender diversity on the board. Thus, this research provides theoretical and empirical insights into the issue of gender diversity in relation to CSR. Regulators and stakeholders should be aware of the potential effect of engagement in CSR reporting and of the benefits of having a gender-diverse board.

Purpose: This paper is an empirical study of the effect of the characteristics of the Sharia supervisory board (SSB) on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using 42 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Islamic banks outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and non-Islamic countries during the 2011/2018 period, a random-effects generalized lease square method for the regression analyzes is applied. Findings: The obtained results show that the characteristics of the SSB affect the financial performance of Islamic banks. The results also affirm that a large-sized board of directors and the number of SSB meetings improve banking performance while the cross-mandate seems to destroy it. On the other hand, the SSB members' competence and reputation and the proportion of women sitting in SSB have no impact on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives a comprehensive literature survey on the effect of the characteristics of the SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Practical implications: This study offers insights into the practitioner and Islamic banking regulators interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies that investigate the effect of the characteristics of SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks in particular in Islamic banks in the MENA region outside the GCC and in non-Islamic countries.

This study examines whether the board of directors' compensation schemes affect stock market valuations for banks in a dual banking system (Islamic and conventional banks). We employ an international sample of 11 countries for the period 2010-2015. Our results show that for the full sample (i.e. irrespective of the bank type), board of directors' compensation has a significant and positive impact on stock market valuations. For different bank types, we find that the positive effect of the board of directors' compensation on market valuations holds only for conventional banks, with insignificant evidence for their Islamic counterparts. We, also, examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory board's compensation on Islamic banks value. Our results show that investors positively perceived and priced information related to this boards' compensation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the indirect relationship between board gender diversity and capital structure decisions and to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French non-financial listed companies over the period 2006-2019, this paper uses structural equations modeling, difference-in-differences using propensity score matching and chow test to highlight these effects. Findings: This paper finds that the relationship between the board gender diversity and the capital structure is mediated through the information transparency channel and firm risk taking channel. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of board gender diversity on capital structure decisions varies through the approach adopted (voluntary, enabling or coercive). Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the study is to the knowledge the first to examine whether and how board gender diversity affects capital structure decisions through two mediations channels, namely, the information transparency and the firm risk taking. Second, the study is one of the first to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom: coercive, enabling or voluntary approach.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Cyber risk has become one of the greatest threats to firms in recent years. Accordingly, boards of directors must be continually vigilant about this danger. They have a duty to ensure that the companies adopt appropriate cybersecurity measures to manage the risk of cyber fraud. Boards should also ensure that the firm disclose material cyber risk and breaches. We examine how the board's gender composition can influence the extent of such disclosure, based on a sample of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 Index over the period 2014-2018. Results show evidence of a positive association between the presence and level of cybersecurity disclosure and board gender diversity. However, the board must boast a critical mass of at least three women before this positive impact can be observed. Our findings contribute to the debate on the importance of gender diversity by adding the concept of the positive influence of heterogeneity on cyber disclosure. We also augment the literature on the critical mass of women in boardrooms by providing empirical evidence that three or more women constitute the threshold for better governance. Our study has important implications for investors, stakeholders and regulators. If investors wish to increase cybersecurity disclosure, they should ask for more diversified boards. Our findings support regulators in their efforts to increase women's representation on boards by providing empirical evidence of better outcomes with this type of board composition.

We examine the effect of dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on Islamic banks' liquidity creation. We also investigate whether managerial ability is a channel through which such governance mechanisms influence liquidity creation. Using data for 110 Islamic and conventional banks from 11 countries for the period of 2005-2015, we find that better Shariah supervisory board (SSB) governance increases on-balance sheet liquidity creation but decreases off-balance sheet liquidity creation. This result is robust to an analysis of subsamples, to individual governance attributes, to interactions of dual governance mechanisms, and when controlling for endogeneity issues. Our results reveal that both SSBs and regular boards of directors affect liquidity creation by enhancing managerial ability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines two dimensions of diversity on the board of directors (BOD) and the sharia supervisory board (SSB), namely, gender diversity and educational diversity, and their influence on risk taking by Islamic banks. The study extends the literature by examining whether the influence of gender and educational diversity on Islamic banks' risk taking differs based on whether the bank is publicly listed. Based on a sample of Islamic banks in twenty-six countries, the findings suggest that greater representation of women on the BOD decreases the insolvency risk at listed Islamic banks and that the educational diversity of BOD and SSB members has a significant influence on Islamic banks' risk taking, conditional on whether they are publicly listed. The results are robust to market-based risk measures and the use of a difference-generalized method of moments estimator and propensity score matching technique. (c) 2021 The Authors

Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to use a new broad board effectiveness index, which has been created from several internal attributes of board of directors and to investigate the association of the overall index regarding stock price crash risk. Design/methodology/approach: The authors create a new board effectiveness index from a comprehensive set of board attributes, including the number of board meetings, the number of board attendances, the expertise of the directors, the size of the board and the number of independent directors, in order to test with the stock price crash risk by using panel regression models with fixed effects. The two-stage least squared regression ensures endogeneity issues. Findings: An increase in board effectiveness index lowers firm-specific crash risk. Moreover, female directors enhance the board effectiveness. Originality/value: With a new broad board effectiveness index, this paper is unique from other studies as the authors focus on the overall index rather than on a single dimension of board attributes.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

Given the contrasting empirical results of the literature, the question of the influence of the presence of women on corporate boards of directors (WOCB) on the corporate social performance (CSP), we revisit this problem by developing a semi-parametric approach to capture the non-linear effects of this relationship. The results show that sociological diversity, organizational learning, and pluralistic regulation all play critical roles in CSP. Feminization of the Board successfully helps to the enrichment of its decision-making by increasing the total cognitive, knowledge, and skill diversity. Nonetheless, when a threshold value is achieved, the positive marginal impact of Board feminization on CSP declines while WOCB grows, implying a diminishing marginal utility. (c) 2022

Purpose: The authors estimate the effect of the gender composition of company boards on firm performance by exploiting variation in the percentage of women after the implementation of a 2011 Belgian policy reform, which introduced a gender quota for listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze the evolution of firm performance between companies that were subjected to the quota law and compare it with the performance of similar firms that were not subjected to the law. This difference-in-difference (DiD) approach allows the authors to avoid the potential bias resulting from unobserved firm characteristics. Findings: The authors find that the quota policy resulted in the replacement of about one male director by a female one in the average firm between 2010 and 2017. However, this increase in diversity appears to have negatively affected some firm performance indicators. The authors find statistically significant negative effects for 10 out of the 23 financial indicators included in this study, while the other 13 indicators showed no significant effect. Originality/value: The originality of this research lies in both the methodology and the findings. The policy reform that the authors study can be regarded as a natural experiment so that the DiD method provides estimates of the causal effect of the gender composition of company boards on firm performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that presents causal evidence of negative effects of gender quota on organizational performance. These results cast doubts on the business case argument for gender quota and show that results from correlational studies are likely to be biased upward. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Purpose: The direct nexus between board characteristics, earnings management (EM) practices and dividend payout is examined in this study, followed by an examination of the indirect mediation impact of EM practices in the nexus between board characteristics and dividend payout. It aims to provide new empirical evidence from the Jordanian market, which is an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study population consists of all service firms that were listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) between 2012 and 2019. Due to the lack of availability of their complete data during the period, four service firms were omitted from the population; hence, a sample of 43 service firms was acquired over the time frame (2012-2019), yielding a total of 344 firm-year observations. Moreover, panel data analysis was employed in this study, and data for the study were acquired from yearly reports as well as the ASE's database. Findings: Based on the GMM estimator findings, board size and independence have a negative and significant influence on the EM, but CEO/chairman duality has a positive and significant impact. Simultaneously, the impacts of female representation on the board of directors and the number of board meetings were both positive but insignificant. The findings also found that four board characteristics, including board size, female representation on the board of directors, CEO/chairman duality and the number of board meetings, had a significant negative or positive effect on dividend payout, while board independence did not. Additional findings show that EM practices have a direct negative insignificant effect on dividend payout, whereas EM practices partially mediate the relationship between board characteristics and dividend payout. Research limitations/implications: The current study's limitation is that it only searched in Jordanian service firms listed on ASE from 2012 to 2019 to fulfill the study's objectives; thus, we urge that future work explores the study models for other sectors, whether in Jordan or other growing markets such as the Middle East and North Africa. Practical implications: The findings of this study may be utilized by analysts, investors and other strategic decision-makers to enhance Jordan's financial market's efficiency and efficacy. These findings will improve policymakers' willingness to impose appropriate constraints, perhaps boosting Jordan's financial market performance and efficacy. These findings may also help investors make more enlightened judgments by utilizing board characteristics and EM factors that predict firm dividend policy. Originality/value: Contradictions in the results of earlier investigations inspired the current study, with the findings filling a gap in the existing literature. This study differs from previous studies by constructing a novel research model and analyzing the mediating influence of EM in the nexus between board characteristics and dividend payout.

We examine the relationship between women directors and corporate social performance (CSP) by considering the contingency effects of home-country culture. Drawing on upper echelons and social role theories, we hypothesize that greater women representation on boards positively affects CSP due to their distinctive expertise, perspectives, and knowledge in this area, which strengthen their firms' attention and resources devoted to it. We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors' views and boards' openness to them. Based on data for 3175 firms across 38 countries between 2008 and 2015, our multilevel analysis provides support for most of our hypotheses. (c) 2022, Academy of International Business.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on board gender diversity. Prior research shows that female directors play a beneficial role. The advantage of board gender diversity should be particularly helpful when firms have to navigate an uncertain environment. So the authors hypothesize that firms adjust their board gender diversity in response to EPU. Design/methodology/approach: The authors execute a regression analysis. To minimize endogeneity, the authors execute firm-fixed effects regressions, an instrumental variable (IV) analysis and propensity score matching. Findings: Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors find that firms significantly raise board gender diversity in response to EPU. To draw a causal inference, the authors exploit the 9/11 terrorist attack as an exogenous shock that elevated EPU unexpectedly. The authors' IV analysis corroborates the results. Finally, the authors show that board gender diversity substantially mitigates the adverse effect on shareholder wealth brought about by an unanticipated negative shock attributed to the 9/11 attack. Originality/value: According to the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effect of EPU on board gender diversity. This research contributes to two important areas of the literature, i.e. board gender diversity and EPU. The authors show that board gender diversity is beneficial and firms act accordingly when facing more economic uncertainty. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study examines the effect of board size on the economic impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the US. Using a hand-collected dataset of 508 M&A between 2012 and 2018, we find that board size is negatively related to acquirer excess returns. In an additional analysis, we show that large boards have positive value implications for banks that combine the CEO and chairman roles as well as for large banks. Our findings indicate that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to board size is not necessarily in the interests of shareholders; instead, a more flexible and proactive formulation is needed.

Purpose: Joint board management meetings bring boards of directors and top management teams together to share information and discuss company matters. The authors investigate whether these joint meetings are associated with higher agency costs or information sharing benefits in the context of firm earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: Using publicly disclosed data on the frequency of joint board management meetings in Indonesian firms, the authors examine the relationship between joint board management meetings and earnings management during 2010-2017. Findings: The authors find that more joint board management meetings are associated with lower earnings management. This is consistent with joint board management meetings providing net information sharing benefits. Additional testing indicates that the results are the strongest when firms hold more joint board management meetings than regular board meetings. Originality/value: The findings suggest that in addition to holding regular board and audit committee meetings, formal meetings between boards of directors and top management teams are beneficial to shareholders by restricting opportunistic accounting choices by firm management.

Drawing on institutional theory and homophily network theory, we argue theoretically and support empirically that higher economic freedom reduces the board of director diversity. Using a large U.S. sample of 26,142 firm-year pairs for 1996-2015, we find that firms located in the states with higher economic freedom are less likely to foster gender or ethnic diversity on their boards. The results are robust to a battery of variables that capture differences in economic freedom, gender, and ethnic diversity. The results are also robust to various empirical tests, including endogeneity analyses, such as propensity score matching and the instrumental variable approach. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in company activities, discussions on how to use AI in company management have emerged. Although AI is not legally recognised as a director in company law, there are examples of robot directors such as Vital, which have managed to get a seat in the corporate boardroom. Today, AI is on the verge of playing an important role in corporate governance. However, whether it has a seat on the board of directors or an important role in decision making is still a hot topic. Another critical discussion in the field of corporate governance in recent years is board diversity, which aims to improve the corporate decision-making process and create efficiency. This article attempts to anticipate the potential impact of AI on corporate board diversity policies and regulations. Therefore, this article seeks to examine the effects of the inevitable use of AI in the corporate decision-making process on corporate board gender diversity discussions and regulations under three possibilities: AI as a board member, AI as an enabler to assist a decision maker or AI being used to help decision making such as selecting board members.

Purpose: The gender theory demonstrates that women have made significant contributions to the increases of firm performance and monitoring the management. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the association between audit committee gender diversity (ACGD) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure of the firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female members on the AC and CSR disclosure. The final sample in this study consists of 693 firm-year observations from Iranian listed firms over the period 2012-2018. Moreover, to ensure the robustness of the findings, this study uses a series of sensitivity analysis tests. Findings: The regression results show that ACGD has a significant positive influence on the level of CSR disclosure. The finding is robust to alternative measure of ACGD, CSR disclosure and endogeneity concern. Practical implications: The findings have numerous practical implications for regulators, policy makers, managers and investors. This study has implications for Iranian regulators and policymakers and sends positive signal about recommending or requiring gender diversity on the board and its subgroups such as AC. Furthermore, the findings have implications for the investors, so that they have to make informed investment decisions given both financial factors and ACGD, and eventually invest in those firms with women membership in their AC's composition. Social implications: Concerning with board of directors and the general assembly of shareholders, as the findings suggest the significant role of ACGD in the enhancement of CSR disclosure, boards and the general assembly are to engage women in AC composition to both increase AC efficiency and improve CSR disclosure level. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind that investigates the association between ACGD and CSR disclosure in emerging capital markets, and therefore can contribute to extend the current literature on CSR in developing countries, especially Iran's emerging capital market.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Public corporations often appoint external former founders to their boards in hope that they will encourage a (re-)focus on creating future new business. Seeking to investigate this common practice, we integrate upper echelons theory with imprinting theory, arguing that founding a company indeed represents a formative experience that will leave an imprint on founders and their subsequent board decision-making. Subsequent to their founding experience, however, some founders may be subjected to likewise formative but public corporate experiences, for instance, by taking their own business public or by assuming CEO positions in other corporations, that will lead to a decay of the original founding imprint and its effect. We find support for our reasoning across corporate boards in S&P1500 firms ranging from 2000 to 2012. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Purpose: This study aims to identify a relationship between the presence of women on the board of directors (BOD) of Brazilian companies and the firms' disclosure and participation in projects or initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Design/methodology/approach: The research used an adaptation of the model by Ben-Amar et al. (2017), added two other gender variables and analyzed a sample of 42 companies listed on the Brazilian stock exchange that participate in the Brazilian GHG protocol program. As for the models with the variables of interest, the most significant was the female percentage, Blau's index, the dummy of female presence, the number of women on BOD, total years with the woman on board and the number of committees the board women were. Findings: The results for the sample showed that women were present on the BOD 475 times, against a male presence of 4,538 times. Empirical evidence confirms the research hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between the presence of women on the BOD and the likelihood of participation in the Brazilian GHG protocol program. Research limitations/implications: The fact that few companies are listed on Brasil, Bolsa and Balcao and participate in the Brazilian GHG protocol program. Therefore, the impact of these findings may be reduced when compared with countries presenting more listed companies that have joined this type of program to diminish GHG emissions. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on accounting, discussing carbon accounting in the field of environmental accounting and emphasizing that climate change-related risks greatly influence business and corporate assets. According to an article published by the World Resources Institute Brasil (2019), Brazil is the seventh country with the highest GHG emissions in the world. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This research examines the impact of board gender diversity on CSR disclosure for Tunisian listed banks during the period 2012-2017. Data for CSR disclosure are collected using the content analysis of the annual reports of the banks. To measure the level of CSR disclosure, we used the grid adopted by Branco and Rodrigues (Corporate Communications: An International Journal 11:232-248, 2006, Journal of Business Ethics 83:685-701, 2008). The results show that board gender diversity affects positively the level of CSR disclosure. This implies that the female representation in the board of directors promotes CSR disclosure by listed Tunisian banks. Furthermore, the level of CSR disclosure is affected positively by the bank size and negatively by the directors independence. The paper contributes to the literature on best practices in corporate governance for financial institutions in emerging markets. The results have implications for banks and policy makers in Tunisia. For banks, it shows the relevance of female representation on boards of directors to meet the CSR reporting needs of the users of annual reports. Policy makers can enforce the presence of women in top management position and more specifically on the boards of directors when drafting corporate governance regulations.

Recent post-SOX studies have consistently found that the presence of audit committee (AC) directors with multiple directorships is associated with lower financial reporting quality. An implicit assumption of these studies is that AC directors distribute their effort equally across all their directorships. Using a firm size-based proxy and firm risk-based (i.e. probabilities of litigation and of misstatements) proxies to measure relative directorship importance, we investigate (1) whether and how AC directors who serve on multiple AC directorships allocate their effort to different directorships unequally, and (2) whether the unequal prioritization of effort across multiple AC directorships relates to AC monitoring effectiveness. We find a positive (no) relation between the risk-based (firm size-based) directorship importance measures and AC effectiveness, suggesting that AC directors serving on multiple boards unequally allocate their effort to different directorships based on incentives related to firm risk and not to firm size. Our results have relevance for regulators, boards of directors, investors, and other stakeholders. (c) 2022 European Accounting Association.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

Consumer satisfaction is a widespread measure of company success, and it shows positive interdependence with several key performance indicators of an enterprise. Although many researchers emphasize that women directors have a positive influence on the economic success of a firm, little research has focused on the impact that females on a board of directors have on customer satisfaction. This paper resumes previous insights on determinants of customer satisfaction and shows that a more balanced gender representation in corporate governance bodies can positively affect customer satisfaction with a company.

In this article we investigate the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors and in executive positions on the risk and profitability of75 banks in ten ASEAN countries during the period of 2002-2018.We find that banks with more women in executive positions show higher capital risk, i.e., Z-score and capital ratio. However, the women-led banks have higher market to book ratios and they are more profitable in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Furthermore, our findings shed light on the relationship between gender diversity and financial decision-making in the company by highlighting that the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banks with more executives' women are more risky and have higher profits than the men-led banks. We also find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces performance in ROA and ROE. Bank performance measured by market-to-book (PB), is the lowest when there are females on the board. This highlights the gender differences in investment behavior and the women's needs in banks at Asian region. Given that bank performance has a direct effect on the stability of the financial system as well as on economic growth in the country, it is essential for the regulatory authorities to assess variety of sources which can improve performance and governance in (ASEAN) banks.

This study examines the effect of CEO-connected directors on firm value. Empirical analyses are conducted on US firms between 1999 and 2016 using a local supply of directors as an instrumental variable. CEO-connected directors contribute to the firm by resolving information asymmetry. I find that firms with more CEO-connected directors produce more innovative outputs than those with fewer CEO-connected directors. However, such directors exacerbate managerial entrenchment. Hence, it is necessary to establish rules for the board of directors that reflect firm-specific characteristics, such as information transparency.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

This article studies, over the period 2006 to 2019, both the structure and the evolution of corporate networks built on shared board directors between the largest listed firms of three European countries: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It offers a longitudinal and up-to-date analysis of the state of links between companies through examining interlocking directorates. Contrary to previous studies which have emphasized a decline of interlocks when analyzed at the board director level, we observe relative stability of these networks at the corporate level with a number of connected firms remaining quite stable despite a decline of board ties. As a result, the most central companies remain mainly the same at the national and international level over the considered period. Our findings provide evidence for the resource perspective: access to key resources seemingly pushes firms to continue their network participation despite strengthened national regulations on directors with multiple board seats. This evolution echoes the concept of weak ties of Granovetter (Am J Sociol 78: 360-1380, 1973). Lastly, it is worth noting that it cannot be affirmed that there has been an emergence of a cross-national network which operates to substitute national board ties.

Purpose: The objective of this paper is to analyze in an international setting the relationship between environmental disclosures, carbon emissions and gender equality on the board of directors with the cost of equity (CoE) in the food and beverage sector. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample includes 142 listed firms and 1,562 firm-observations from 35 developed and developing countries between 2009 and 2019. The authors implement a fixed-effects regression model to contrast the impact of the three sustainable variables of interest on the CoE. Findings: The results of this study indicate that firms in the food and beverage industry benefit from a lower CoE due to better environmental disclosures and gender equality. On the other hand, carbon intensive firms are penalized with higher equity costs. Originality/value: This study expands prior research on the effects of sustainable behavior on the CoE in the food and beverage industry by taking into account additional sustainability variables and a greater number of observations, both from developed and from developing countries.

This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of shareholder activism as a change mechanism for improving gender diversity on corporate boards. We provide evidence that shareholders use both internal pressure through private negotiations that lead to a withdrawn proposal, and external pressure by submitting a proposal to vote in the annual shareholders' meeting to draw public attention. While both are impactful, we find that improvement in board gender diversity is more responsive to private negotiations than to social pressure. We also find that shareholders' votes in favor of diversity proposals are higher when a board is less diverse; but it's the very existence of a proposal that matters and not how many votes it receives. Finally, we find that proposals sponsored by institutional investors are more effective in bringing gender diversity to corporate boards. (c) 2020 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

Due to the fast outbreak of COVID-19, and the related request of acting as socially responsible organizations, companies have increased their attention towards the improvement of their CSR disclosure practices. With this in mind, the article examines whether and how women directors impact on the CSR disclosure quality by focusing on the implications of their appointment to the board of directors, also in terms of critical mass and presence on the board of statutory auditors. Relying on hand-collected data of 315 Italian publicly listed non-financial firms observed in 2019, the formulated predictions are tested through logistic regression analyses by using the assurance of CSR social reporting by external auditors as dependent variable. The paper extends prior literature on the relationship between gender diversity and disclosure quality as it provides evidence not only on the impact of the appointment of women on board but also on the effect of their critical mass and presence on the board of statutory auditors. Furthermore, it extends the research on CSR reporting by appreciating its quality in terms of social report assurance by external auditors. Following the recent post COVID-19 policy-making interventions devoted to foster the women's involvement in companies' activities, the paper suggests firms and their board nomination committee to appoint more female directors and auditors as they can improve the level of company disclosure quality.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Gender diversity on the board of directors can influence companies' voluntary disclosure such as their environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG). A growing body of literature suggests that most of the work of the board occurs in committees, which are smaller working groups within the board. In a smaller working group, even a small number of women can represent a higher proportion of the group. Therefore, the influence of gender diversity on a board's decisions can be more prevalent in committees, since women's ideas and opinions can have more of an impact in smaller working groups. By being on committees, women have the chance to actively contribute to board tasks and decisions. This study investigates the relationship between the gender diversity of the board and its main committees and the ESG disclosure of Canadian-listed companies. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between female representation on the board and committees and ESG disclosure. Using a structural equation model, the results suggest that there is a joint influence on ESG disclosure of gender diversity at the board level and at the committee. level. In addition, the study demonstrates that for ESG disclosure, the influence of female representation on committees is higher than the influence of female representation on the board. This study shows that by being on committees, women can better contribute to board decisions and that the influence of board gender diversity is not limited to female representation on the board but also comes from female representation on committees.

Women's representation on corporate boards has recently drawn increasing attention. This study aims to investigate the moderator role of females on the board of directors on the relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and stock price informativeness. This research uses secondary data obtained from the Sahra database with the span of 158 active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Findings indicated that the presence of female directors on the board had a favorable impact on the correlation between EQ and pricing informativeness. That is, firms with more female board members have a greater association between EQ and stock price informativeness. The practical application of this research relates to female CEOs' monitoring roles, thereby enhancing the quality of financial reporting. (c) 2022, Institute of Economic Sciences.

In this study, I examine the effectiveness of a national board gender diversity disclosure requirement, which is, arguably, on the "soft" end of the continuum of boardroom interventions. Using a panel dataset of 1847 hand-collected corporate disclosures from 2015 to 2018, I perform a post-event, historical trend analysis of the efficacy of Canada's 2014 intervention. I find evidence of real progress in the 4 years following intervention against several benchmarks. Specifically, improvements in critical mass are documented, with the proportion of boards with three of more women reaching 18.8% in 2018. Tokenism remains an issue with very little change in the number of Canadian boards with only one woman. Further analyses using a sorting methodology and panel regression analysis reveal that progress toward board gender diversity is achieved by those with board gender targets, board seat renewal policies, and written board diversity policies. In addition, I find that larger companies achieve greater progress and that progress is clustered by industry. (c) 2022 W. Michael Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.

Recently, regulators and investors have shown an increasing interest in the promotion of diversity in the corporate boards of directors. In this paper, we employ data from the Australian bank boards to provide new insights on the diversity-risk nexus, based on a dataset of the Australian banks for the period of 2004 to 2019. We examine board gender diversity from two perspectives across the board and among board leaders. Our results support the context-dependent impact of gender diversity on the board of directors and highlight the beneficial impact on the risk of banks when considering gender diversity and the presence of a dominant gender group in the boardroom.

This study investigates whether CEOs are rewarded for actively making changes. We construct a comprehensive executive dataset from SEC filings and use non-CEO executive turnover to proxy for changes. We find that after executive turnovers, CEOs are less likely to be dismissed, and the change is not temporary. In addition, firm performance improves after executive turnovers. The results suggest that when boards of directors evaluate CEOs, they consider whether CEOs can overcome inertia and initiate changes. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Worldwide, recent corporate financial scandals have raised many questions in terms of risk management and governance of banks. This study examines the impact of risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms on bank performance. Focusing on a sample of large banks, we want to assess the effect of the board of directors and risk management committee features as well as the presence of a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) in the executive board on performance over the period 2006-2017. To examine this relation properly, we employ the system-GMM (Generalized Method of Moments). Results show the importance of the risk management committee in enhancing bank performance. We also find that the presence of a CRO in the bank's executive board decreases performance and that the lower the number of meetings, women, and independent members, the better the banks' performance. Most importantly, results show that establishing risk governance will make banks more profitable and sustainable for the future.

This study set out to determine how corporate governance hierarchies influence the performance of commercial banks in Cameroon. To attain this core objective, a questionnaire was administered to shareholders, members of boards of directors, top management, and nonexecutive employees of nine commercial banks operating in Cameroon. The data mobilized were analyzed using percentages, ordinary least square (OLS) regressions, and robust standard error tests. The findings reveal that the hierarchical effectiveness of internal auditing, executive compensation, and the ratings of institutions and financial markets significantly increase the performance of commercial banks in Cameroon. This was not the case with boards of directors and regulations. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: This study aims to evaluate changes in the presence of women on Spanish boards after the Unified Good Governance Code of Listed Companies (2006) and the Organic Law 3/2007 on Gender Equality, and this study compares the educational background of women and men directors. Also, this study analyses the influence of gender diversity and educational background of women directors on economic performance, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and, ultimately, firm value. In addition, this study explores the differences in board gender composition and its effect on firm value during the crisis and post-crisis periods. Finally, this study analyses the different influence of women directors depending on their typology. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a system of structural equations and a sample of 4,101 directors of 30 Spanish companies listed on IBEX-35 over 2008-2017. Findings: The results show that women's presence on boards has grown since 2008, and they have higher educational background than men. This study finds that women directors improve economic performance and CSR, though results are non-significant for firm value. Women directors with a bachelor's or master's degree increase economic and social performance but reduce firm value. Women directors with business or industry-related studies positively influence CSR but business specialisation negatively affects economic performance and firm value. Originality/value: This study analyses the direct and indirect effect of women directors on firm value, the influence of their educational background and the potential differences arising from the economic situation (crisis) and the type of board position they hold.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This chapter investigates the role of board of directors in corporate philanthropic activities, a strand of corporate social responsibility. We find that independent boards, female directors, and directors' ownership compensation tend to increase the incidence and level of corporate charitable giving. However, the presence of business experts on the board reduces the probability and the level of charitable giving. We also find that CEO power and bonus plan reduce the propensity of companies to donate to charitable causes but have no effect on the amount donated. Yet CEO ownership tends to be positively related to charitable contributions. CEO tenure, on the other hand, positively affects corporate decisions to contribute to charitable causes as well as the extent of such CSR investment. CEO age and expertise do not exert any influence on the decision to make corporate charitable giving. However, older CEOs negatively affect amount donated. Overall, findings indicate corporate governance quality and CSR-contingent compensation contracts as a way of increasing corporate philanthropy.

This chapter discusses corporate governance; they promote governance as a system by which companies and organizations are directed and controlled. Good governance involves a number of aspects that occur in the process of governing. Corporate governance policies and practices define the performance of an organization. The main pillars of corporate governance are accountability, transparency, fairness, and disclosure. The performance of companies and organizations in relation to these pillars determines their overall evaluation in terms of good governance. The definitions of governance and good governance are now folded into a discussion of corporate and nonprofit governance. The boards of directors play a significant role in the overall management and control of corporations and organizations. A corporate board of directors is generally the oversight body that ensures the company's performance meets the owners' or stakeholders' expectations and helps manage/resolve disputes in the process.

Research Question/Issue: We contrast the predictions of gender socialization theory and "fem-power washing" (deceptively positioning as a firm promoting female empowerment without any tangible actions) to investigate whether promoting female directors on the board of directors associates with a reduction in the prevalence of firm-level workplace sexual harassment (SH). Research Findings/Insights: We estimate the incidence rate of SH through textual analysis of US employees' job reviews published online during the period 2011-2021. We find that an increase of one female director is associated with a 21.81% decrease in workplace SH and that firms with high board gender diversity synchronize the reduction in SH with improved social policies (e.g., policies to better employee relations, health and safety, or diversity challenges). Our results do not support the fem-power washing theory but rather imply that nominating female directors may have a profound impact on the firm's ethical culture. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study validates the ethical dimension of corporate governance: Nominating female directors impacts a firm harassment culture and, by extension, a firm's ethical and corporate culture. This study adds to the governance literature that debates the merits of board gender diversity by highlighting an oft-ignored channel through which board diversity affects firm value: ethics and corporate culture. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For boards of directors, having more female directors can curb workplace SH, a behavior that is associated with a severe and lasting negative effect on firm value. For practitioners, regulators, and the business community, this study reinforces the merits of aiming towards more gender-balanced boards. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Our study focuses on the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of banks. Our basic idea is that several determinants of the board of directors could affect the profitability of banks. We conducted an econometric study using an estimate by panel data from a sample of 66 French banks observed over the period 2015-2019. Thus, our research aims to see more closely the nature of the relationship between these banks governance mechanisms and banking performance. The results demonstrated a positive and significant relationship between gender diversity and profitability. In addition, we found a positive impact of the independence of directors on profitability while the impact of the duality of the CEO has negative and significant effects on the profitability of the bank. We also use the Newey-West estimator and the method of weighted last square to confirm the relationship between corporate governance and banking profitability.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of firm financial and operational characteristics on the level of forward-looking information disclosure (FLID) by Egyptian-listed non-financial companies. The present research also aims to investigate the moderating role of gender diversity on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The sample incorporates the non-financial companies included in the EGX 100 of the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE), whose reports were available during the study period from 2013 to 2018. The final sample comprises 49 companies with 294 observations. Statistical analysis is performed using multiple regression analysis. Findings: This study found a significant positive impact of return on assets, leverage, company size and age on the level FLID, while external audit firm type and industry were found to impact the level of FLID negatively. Further, the board gender diversity (BGD) is found to have a moderating impact as it strengthens the effect of financial and operational characteristics on the level of FLID. Practical implications: The present study has some implications for Egyptian companies, investors in the Egyptian market and regulators in emerging economies, which include paying more attention to BGD when selecting the board members by companies as well as following up the female representation in all the listed companies by regulators. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the moderating role of BGD and its impact on the level of FLID in emerging markets. This extends the disclosure literature as the present study brings new evidence from an emerging market regarding BGD moderating role as early research concentrated on the direct impact of BGD on the level of FLID.

In this paper, we analyze whether a firm's governance structure plays a role in corporate sustainability performance. Specifically, we study the impact of busy outside directors (outside directors who serve on multiple boards) on firms' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. By doing so, we are able to test the Overcommitment and the Reputation Hypotheses. We find a positive relationship between busy outside directors and ESG performance. Busy outside directors have a positive impact on not just the total ESG score but also on individual components of ESG. The Environment Score is most affected by busy outside directors, while Governance score seems to be minimally impacted. Contrary to the theory that busy outside directors are overcommitted and detract from firm value, our results lend support to the theory that busy outside directors enhance the firm's sustainability performance because of their involvement, experience and reputation.

This study aimed at identifying the effect of board size and board gender diversity on dividend payout and identifying the role of return on assets (ROA) in moderating the effect of size and board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study population consisted of (45) service shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), during the period (2009-2018), using balanced panel data of (36) service companies with (360) observations. The results indicate that the level of female representation in the boards of service companies in Jordan is still low compared to other countries. The results also showed that board size and board gender diversity affect dividend payout. In addition, the return on assets moderates the effect of board size on dividend payout. The results also showed that the return on assets does not moderate the effect of board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study recommends that regulatory bodies should take a step towards encouraging gender diversity in boards to enhance board of directors' effectiveness, through amending legislations that regulate female participation in boards, such as the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code.

This study investigates the effect of the Chair-CEO chronological age gap on the performance of commercial banks listed on the London Stock Exchange. We examine either the Chair-CEO generational gap (a minimum age gap of 20 years) or the Chair-CEO age difference (+/- or absolute). We find significant evidence for the hypothesis that the Chair-CEO age dissimilarity is likely to increase bank performance. Additional identification attempts include the use of the 2007-2009 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, the positive linkage between age difference and bank performance was more intensified. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines the empirical relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and bank continuity. Moreover, it examines the moderating role of ownership structure, and women on boards of directors as index of social performance (SP) among Iraqi listed banks in the context of social responsibility. The researchers used panel data from 12 years (2008-2019) and applied OLS to verify whether ownership structure and gender diversity modifies the relationship between EQ and bank continuity. The study found that Iraqi banks are in a state of financial instability and that the EQ is significantly low. This paper also provides evidence that managerial and concentration ownership has no effect as moderating variables on an administration's motives towards maintaining a bank's continuity and EQ. In addition, the study found that the presence of women on the board of directors plays a significant role as a moderating variable, as gender diversity in the board of directors improves the relationship between EQ and a bank's continuity.

This paper examines whether gender diversity (GD) on corporate boards influences financial performance (FP) of Indian firms using System Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) methods by considering panel data of 364 firms during 2017 to 2021, comprising of 1820 firm-year observations. The study reveals that the mere presence of a woman director (WD) on boards makes no difference in financial performance. Presence of WDs as a significant portion of the boards and their active roles in the functioning and governance of companies positively contribute to firms' financial performances and economic value creation. Regarding other governance parameters, the study shows that larger boards do not necessarily improve firm performance. Also, independent directors do not necessarily add value to corporate performance and value creation. While a higher promoter's stake is an important factor for Indian companies to drive corporate performance, firms with separate CEO and chairperson outperform firms with CEO duality. The study also reveals that the covid 19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial performance and economic profit generation of the Indian firms. This study is important for several reasons. First, this study considers the period (2017-2021) when Indian companies adopted new financial reporting practices (IND-AS) in line with International Financial Reporting System (IFRS), the mandatory quota system of women directors' appointment is implemented and new corporate governance norms are implemented. Hence, our study contributes to the literature by proving meaningful insights on the role of gender diversity and other corporate governance parameters on financial performance of Indian firms in the light of newly adopted accounting and financial reporting practices. Second, few previous India based studies have mostly used pooled OLS or fixed effect models, and did not address the endogeneity problem in different forms like Dynamic Endogeneity, Simultaneity, and Unobserved Heterogeneity. This paper addresses the endogeneity problem appropriately by using the system generalized method of moments (GMM) while modelling the relation between WDs and firms' FP. Therefore, the findings of this study are more reliable and unbiased and can be useful for effective policy making on gender diversity and corporate governance issues. Third, few prior studies which have looked into the role of WDs on FP of Indian firms, have mostly used return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q as performance parameters. Here, in addition to ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we also use economic value added (EVA) as indicators of corporate performance to understand the role of WDs on economic value creation for companies. The EVA is considered as modern technique to measure the economic profit earned by a firm, and it has gained huge popularity among companies as an improved technique for measuring financial performance for companies. To the best of our knowledge, the role of WDs on economic value creation by firms has not been investigated before particularly in the Indian context. This is another unique contribution of this study. Fourth, the Covid 19 pandemic had impacted global economy severely and India was no exception. Financial performances of most Indian firms were negatively impacted due to the nationwide lockdown and uncertainties about production, revenue and earnings. This study considers both the pre and post Covid 19 pandemic period in examining our central research question using a year dummy. Therefore, our study also captures whether the covid 19 pandemic has actually impacted the financial performance of Indian firms, while modelling this relation. This is another valuable and unique contribution of this study to the literature. The findings of this study provide an understanding of how board gender diversity and other governance parameters influence financial performance of Indian firms in an emerging market context. The outcomes are also explained and aligned with the relevant policy implications in the light of recent Indian corporate governance norms and policies. These findings are useful to the companies and policymakers, as they can use these findings while designing effective boards, which can be useful in improving firm performance. Board of directors, investors, regulators, and policymakers can effectively use these findings to understand how gender diverse boards and other corporate governance parameters influence firms' financial performance under the concentrated ownership pattern.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Board of Directors Effectiveness (BODE) on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies licensed by the Central Bank of Malaysia. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of Shariah Committee Quality (SCQ) on the relationship between BODE and companies' performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 11 Malaysian Takaful companies during the period of 2010-2017. While BDE and SCQ are measured using indices, performance is proxied using ROA and ROE. A panel fixed effect regression analysis is used to test the impact of the BDE on the financial performance of Malaysian Takaful companies and the moderator role of SCQ. Findings: The main finding of this study shows a positive association between BDE and performance. More specifically, boards with a high presence of independent, Muslim and female directors positively contribute to the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Another interesting finding is related to the positive moderating effect of SCQ on the relationship between BDE and performance. This result indicates that a high level of SCQ combined with a high level of board effectiveness improve performance. Practical implications: The finding is of great importance to stakeholders and policymakers to improve their board effectiveness and the quality of the Shariah committee to reduce agency costs and to improve the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Originality/value: This study adds to the prior literature by investigating for the first time the relationship between BDE and performance and the interaction effect of SCQ on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies.

Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Two factors of board composition receive attention as they strongly relate to sustainability issues: gender diversity and board independence. The aim of this study is to test whether the presence of a critical mass of women in boardrooms correlates with firm ESG performance. In addition, we aim to study whether women receiving appointment as executive rather than nonexecutive directors may positively influence ESG performance. Using a sample of Italian companies listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario during 2003-2019, the empirical results show that a critical mass of at least three female directors is necessary to improve ESG performance and that executive women directors represent a crucial component of board mechanisms, in terms of aligning the needs of stakeholders, since they increase ESG performance. Because the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value, we support the idea that female directors in strategic positions in the boardroom may benefit ESG performance. Thus, we support the idea of increasing women's presence on corporate boards and across executive leadership as a measure and a signal of how firms can respond to ESG challenges.

In this paper, we examine the relationship between board gender diversity and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) decoupling and the moderating effect that religiosity has on this relationship. We utilise an international sample of 26,176 firm-year observations that cover the period from 2005 to 2019. Consistent with the upper echelon theory and the gender socialisation theory, we provide evidence that firms with a more gender-diversified board of directors tend to engage less in ESG decoupling, and this relationship is more pronounced among firms domiciled in countries with a low level of religiosity. We also find that the effect of religiosity on the relationship between board gender diversity and ESG decoupling is more pronounced for firms that engage in greenwashing and those operating in controversial industry sectors. Our study contributes to the growing debate on ESG decoupling, offering policy insights to regulators and policymakers into the role of board gender diversity and religiosity in reducing unethical managerial behaviour.

The current study looked at the impact of board of director characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Pakistani setting. The study further added to the body of knowledge by comparing the impact of board characteristics in family versus non-family businesses in an emerging market. The study's sample consists of 139 non-financial Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) listed firms from 2008 to 2019. The level of CSR among sample firms was assessed using a multidimensional financial approach. The random-effect model was employed to test the study's hypotheses. The findings support the dysfunctional view of the role of the board of directors' in family-owned businesses. Overall, board size and CEO duality have a significant negative impact on CSR, whereas board independence has a significant positive impact. While these findings applied to both family-owned and non-family-owned businesses. It was discovered that among family-owned businesses, boards tend to look after the interests of family members, and thus are less likely to support CSR. The findings of this study will assist regulatory authorities, investors, and financial analysts in understanding CSR practices in Pakistani firms, allowing them to review the role of the board of directors in CSR among family and non-family-owned firms.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

Based on a sample of 4,089 multinational companies over the period 2015-2018, this study analyses the role that women leaders play in relation to the implementation of sustainability strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and whether this role depends on the proportion of female presence in management teams. The results show that the commitment to the 2030 Agenda is higher in companies with a woman as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or chairperson of the board of directors, as well as greater gender diversity in both, management teams and the monitoring body. However, the incongruity in the phenomenon of female leadership stereotypes hinders the existence of a complementary relationship that reinforces it. We showed that, consistent with the social role theory, prejudices act as barriers to achieve synergic effects among women in different management positions. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: This study investigates the impact of board characteristics on the stock liquidity of Pakistani listed non-financial firms for the period 2007-2016. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses fixed-effects regression model on a sample of 170 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for regressing the impact of board attributes on stock liquidity while for addressing the endogeneity two-stage least-square (2SLS) and lagged structure models are used. Findings: The study finds that board meetings (BM), directors' attendance (DAT) at BM, board gender diversity, the number of board subcommittees (NBC) and board foreign diversity (BFD) positively affect stock liquidity. Checking the robustness through 2SLS and lagged structure models, it is suggested that the findings are robust to the problem of endogeneity. Practical implications: Outcomes of the study signify the role of novel board attributes in improving the stock liquidity which has implications for investors, the board of directors and policymakers. Originality/value: The authors are the first to investigate the impact of novel board attributes-BFD, directors' remuneration (DR), DAT and the number of board sub-committees on stock liquidity. Up to the best of researchers' knowledge, these board attributes have never been examined before in relation to stock liquidity. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates how women's representation on corporate boards affects financial reporting quality. Drawing on a discussion of existing research, I argue that increasing women's representation on boards reduces undue CEO influence over the board, and thereby, accounting quality will improve. Using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, this paper documents how increasing female representation increases accounting quality. This result holds only in the long run as females gain more experience in the boardroom. In addition, I show that the effect of female representation on accounting quality is attenuated for larger firms and larger boards. This is consistent with the notion that the effect of female representation is likely to be stronger when the information friction is higher. These findings challenge the conventions that underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the influence of board gender diversity on dividend policy and cash holdings in several emerging economies. This study also investigates the nonlinear impact of women on dividend policy and cash holdings and the differences between countries with one- and two-tier board systems. Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes 103 firms listed in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. The data represent all industries except the financial industry. The sample period is the 10 financial years from 2010 to 2019. This study analyzed unbalanced panel data with fixed effect specifications for baseline model analysis. Findings: This study finds robust evidence indicating that women's presence negatively influences dividends and positively influences cash holdings. The findings in the additional analysis are significant and show a nonlinear relationship, supporting the substitution hypothesis. Practical implications: The findings of this paper certainly provided a valuable contribution as a useful empirical guide for policy decision-makers in developing countries, regulators and corporate decision-makers related to board gender diversity. Developed countries have implemented a minimum quota of women boards in the composition of the board of directors. However, there are still few developing countries that implement these policies. Women can reflect or show their values in corporate governance, such as being careful in making decisions and being conservative about risk. These guides policymakers in implementing a minimum quota of women in the composition of the board of directors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the debate on the impact of gender diversity on dividends and cash holdings, especially in ASEAN emerging economies because there is a notable empirical gap relative to developed countries. Moreover, this study contributes to the necessary nuanced understanding of the substitution hypothesis in emerging economies. The results also support the explanation of critical mass theory to account for the nonlinear relationship between the number of women board members and dividends and cash holdings.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In recent decades, there has been a growing demand for companies to take responsibility for the adverse social and environmental effects caused by their activities. As a result, they are no longer only accountable for their economic performance but also their corporate social responsibility. An important pillar of corporate social responsibility is gender diversity in the company as a whole and on the board of directors in particular. The hospital sector, whose activity in itself requires social responsibility, was later than other sectors in its disclosure. This research aims to analyze the influence of corporate social responsibility, together with gender diversity on boards of directors and the COVID-19 pandemic, on the profitability of Spanish private hospitals. In addition, this research studies the dissemination of COVID-19 throughout the Spanish territory, relating wealth and risk. For this purpose, data corresponding to the period 2017-2020 were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis, cluster analysis, and factor analysis. The results show that those socially responsible hospitals show higher profitability, but no causal relationship has been established. Gender diversity negatively influences the profitability of the private hospital sector, although it can be considered non-significant. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the profitability of hospitals, causing a sharp drop. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly influenced by the population density of the territories but also by public health investment, showing a greater propensity to control the pandemic in those regions that allocate more funds to health care.

Prior research has shown that companies' diversity efforts lead to improved company performance and market value. However, measuring and comparing diversity is a challenge for firms since there is not a comprehensive, universally accepted method to measure firm diversity. This study evaluates three publicly available proxy measures (the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index (CEI) ratings and Bloomberg's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, and a Board of Directors gender diversity index) that report on various aspects of firm diversity to assess which are most closely associated with long-term company value using panel regression. We find that higher CEI ratings and Bloomberg's ESG scores are significantly associated with higher Tobin's q levels. A Granger causality analysis found evidence that diversity efforts at firms lead to higher future market performance, not that firms with better market performance are more likely to increase their diversity.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pose a serious threat to human habitats because they are the cause of the increasing number of ecological problems and adverse weather events blighting our planet. Considering the rising trend in environmental concerns and the critical role of the board of directors in strategic corporate decisions, this paper examines the impact of co-opted boards on GHG emissions and the moderating effect of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance-based compensation on the relationship. Using a sample of US firms from 2002 to 2018, the results show a significant negative relationship between co-opted directors and total GHG emissions, i.e., an increase of one standard deviation in the proportion of co-opted directors reduces GHG emissions by 0.27. Additional analysis reports that an increase of one standard deviation in co-opted boards reduces direct and indirect GHG emissions by 0.37 and 1.3, respectively. This implies that firms with co-opted boards ensure the sustainability of their own operations while also making their partner firms environmentally sustainable. Further analysis documents that the influence of co-opted directors on GHG emissions is more pronounced for firms that tie executives' compensation with ESG performance. Our study provides policy implications for regulators against a background of public outcry and stakeholder pressure on firms to mitigate environmental damage and implement environmentally sustainable business practices.

George Floyd's murder caused many firms to reveal how exposed they are to racial diversity issues. We examine investor and firm behaviors after this socially significant event to provide evidence on the valuation effects of the exposure and ensuing corporate responses. We develop a text-based measure of a firm's exposure to racial diversity issues from conference call transcripts and find that, after the murder of George Floyd, firms with diversity exposure experience a stock price decrease of approximately 0.7% around the date of the conference call. We provide evidence that this effect is attributable to race-related exposure and not gender-related exposure. Initiatives taken by firms mitigate the negative market reaction. We document that firms with racial diversity exposure respond by appointing Black directors. The stock market views appointments of Black directors more favorably after George Floyd's murder, except when they are perceived as symbolic. We also find that firms with greater exposure to racial diversity are more likely to establish diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments, appoint DEI leaders, specify diversity goals, increase supply chain diversity, and donate to racial justice causes. Our paper provides evidence that exposure to racial diversity issues adversely affects firm value, and companies address the exposure by taking actions.

The aim of this study was to examine the moderating effect of ownership concentration (OC) on the relationship between impactful female directors and earnings management (EM). The study concentrated on firms with the lowest positive earnings, measured by return on assets. The results showed that OC positively moderated the association between impactful female directors and accrual earnings management (AEM). With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became positively associated with AEM. In terms of real earnings management (REM), the results showed that OC weakened the significant negative relationship between impactful female directors and REM that was found in the direct regression. With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became insignificantly associated with REM. The study is extremely beneficial to policymakers, stakeholders, researchers, and society. It provides empirical findings that could help all parties to re-evaluate the role of the board of directors, specifically impactful female directors, in mitigating EM. The results highlight the impact of the majority shareholders, introduced by agency theory II, an issue that requires more solutions from regulators. (c) 2023 by the author.

This study aimed to examine the interaction effect of the nomination committee's effectiveness on the board of directors' characteristics and firm performance (measured by return on assets and earnings per share). The nomination committee was scored for committee separation, size, independence, meeting frequency, and the number of female directors. The study selected all listed firms on the Bahrain Bourse for two years, 2020 and 2021, using ordinary least-squares regression to examine the relationship. The results showed that the interaction of the nomination committee with some characteristics of the board of directors had a significant impact on firm performance. With the interaction of the nomination committee, board meeting frequency became significantly positively associated with firm performance as measured by return on assets and earnings per share, as opposed to the insignificant results found in the direct relationship. Similarly, with the interaction of the nomination committee, the number of female directors became more significantly positively associated with firm performance using the measurement of return on assets, while it became significantly positively associated with firm performance using earnings per share, compared to an insignificant positive impact found in the direct relationship. The results show that there is a need to re-evaluate the role of the board of directors and strengthen its effectiveness. This study is the first to alert policymakers, businesses and their stakeholders, and researchers to the significance of having an effective nomination committee, which could play an important role in enhancing the board of directors' effectiveness and hence firm performance. It makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the interaction impact of NC (as a score) on BOD characteristics and firm performance.

Although the gender composition of corporate boards and the contribution of female directors to corporate governance have been previously analysed, few studies have investigated the factors that may help contribute to increasing the still scarce presence of women on boards. Therefore, using three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation on a data panel comprising the 100 largest companies in the world according to the 2019 Fortune Global 500 ranking, including data on (re)election proposals for corporate board members, this research aims to analyse the influence of the number of men's nominations, board interlocks, director tenure, geographical area, the sector to which the firms belong, and the relevance of firms on women's nominations for boards of directors. The results show the factors that facilitate the presence of women on boards. In addition, the different influences that remain in the election of female and male directors when considering factors related to the experience, expertise, and networks of directors or the visibility of firms can also be observed. This study contributes to the knowledge of gender diversity on boards, shedding light on the factors that might lead to gender-balanced boards. It could also help companies and policymakers design strategies to build more egalitarian boards. (c) 2023 The Author(s)

This study examines boardroom connections that form when corporate executives sit on mutual fund boards. These connections have the potential to facilitate information flow that informs fund investment decisions. I find that fund trades in the executive's firm anticipate future earnings news and stock returns during the period that the fund and firm are connected. The evidence is consistent with a broad scope of information being transferred through the connections, implying the potential for these connections to have an economically significant impact. For example, trades in the executive's firm predict returns both inside and outside of the earnings announcement period, and trades in stocks in the same sector as the executive's firm also predict returns. This study highlights the potential for the role of fund directors to extend beyond their formal monitoring responsibilities and act as conduits of information.

In this chapter, the impact of board gender diversity on overall firm risk was investigated. Drawing on social identity theory, upper echelons theory, and agency theory, a hypothesis of a negative link between gender diversity on the board of directors and firm risk has been put forward. Using a panel data regression on a sample of large Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) over the period 2016-2020, the author was able to provide empirical evidences supporting the existence of a significant negative impact of the percentage of women on boards of directors on stock return volatility as global firm risk proxy.

We examine the role of managerial talent and its interaction with managerial practices in determining firm performance. We build a matched firm-director panel dataset for the universe of limited liability companies in Italy, tracking directors across different firms over time. We define managerial talent as the individual contribution to the variation of the firms' total factor productivity, estimated using a two-way fixed effects model. Combining the data with survey information on a representative sample of firms, we then document that our measure of talent correlates with ex-ante and ex-post indicators of ability, i.e. managers' educational attainment and their forecast precision with respect to the firm's future performance. Most important, we leverage information on the adoption of managerial practices within the firm to examine potential synergies between managerial talent and structured managerial practices, thus bridging two separate strands of the literature. While talent and structured practices are positively associated with firm productivity on their own, there is evidence of complementarities between the two. These findings hold both in a cross-sectional setting and in a panel analysis that accounts for time-invariant firm heterogeneity. Overall, our results indicate that the effectiveness of managerial practices varies with managers' ability to implement them. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

China is facing an acute portable water problem and presents a picture of severe supply constraints. Thus, China 's water crisis offers attractive business opportunities for foreign water companies as well as domestic private water companies. Hence, the private sector participation in the Chinese water sector is a hot topic. This chapter investigates the impact of gender diversity on board of directors on the financial performance of the Chinese private water companies using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) and unbalanced panel ( random effects ) regression models, which are estimated as the baseline approach on a sample of 19 Chinese private water companies for the period of 2010-2017. The OLS and random effects results show that number of women on board (WB), percent of women on board (%WB), number of female executives (FE), and percent of female executives (%FE) affect the Chinese water companies' financial performance. The results of this chapter are important for researchers, regulators, and policymakers to benefit from policies that encourage board varieties at an individual water company level.

We study the impact of gender diversity in corporate boards on firm value by exploiting a natural experiment setting in India where the government mandated firms to appoint at least one female director on their boards. We find a significantly positive market reaction when firms comply with the mandate but only when they appoint qualified female directors who are not related to promoters. Moreover, market reward is higher for firms headquartered in states with severe gender bias. We show how regulatory intervention mitigates frictions related to gender bias to improve firm value through greater gender diversity when firms respond appropriately. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe. While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) attributes on foreign shareholdings from the perspective of an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined Bombay Stock Exchange listed firms from the Indian stock market and applied a balanced panel data approach with fixed effect estimation technique during the period 2010-2019. Findings: The study shows that CEOs' financial education and a higher level of education positively affect foreign shareholdings. The age and experience of CEO have a positive and significant impact on foreign shareholdings. Firms with male CEOs are preferred more by foreign investors. The effect of CEO busyness and CEO duality is negative on foreign shareholdings. Foreign investors prefer to invest in firms with foreign nationality CEOs. Furthermore, the robustness test reveals that the influence of CEO attributes on foreign shareholdings is stronger for new, small and stand-alone firms than for old, large and group-affiliated firms. Practical implications: The study will be beneficial for a diverse audience ranging from firms' board of directors, regulators and policymakers who are entrusted with the CEO recruitment process. Additionally, firms seeking external financing should disclose CEO information adequately and improve the reporting quality to attract foreign investors, as they consider CEO characteristics as a valuable signal before making investment decisions. Originality/value: In light of the current legislative reforms, this study can be recognized as one of the early studies that explore the relationship between CEO attributes and foreign shareholdings in the context of an emerging economy.

Numerous studies examine corporate boards of directors' composition and firm performance. Far less is known about the factors influencing university boards' composition and university outcomes. This paper fills this void by examining the relationship between university board selection processes and constituent representation, board composition in terms of size and demographic composition, and the influence of board composition on institutional outcomes. We find that institutional sector, Carnegie classification, and wealth predict board size, and that institutions with larger boards tend to have more favorable institutional outcomes. Board gender and racial composition is less correlated with outcomes than is board size. (c) 2023 The Authors. Managerial and Decision Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We investigate the impact of women directors, CEO duality, and board structure on capital structure dynamism for Indian firms. We consider top non-financial BSE Group A firms for the time 2010-2019. We use dynamic panel data methodology to deal with endogeneity concerns that are prevalent in corporate finance variables. The board independence and women directors are positively related to the SOA. Their presence is associated with the faster adjustments of the firms towards the optimum capital structure. On the other hand, board size and CEO duality are negatively associated with the SOA. We further noticed that the speed of adjustment for the strong governance firms is much faster than the weak governance firms. We conclude that the prospective investors should study the governance system of the companies before investing and place a premium on the firms with a good governance system.

This paper aims to find an answer to the questions of "whether chief executive officers (CEOs) are compensated for market risk", and "how the combined interaction of board size and CEO duality moderates this relationship" from the tenets of agency theory and managerial power theory. Even though the contracting view of agency theory posits that agents are neither to be punished nor rewarded for events that go beyond their direct control (market risk), the research findings in the corporate governance domain are contradictory. It was found that Chinese and American executives were paid for market risk, including oil prices and exchange rates, which was explained by retention risk and weaker corporate governance systems. To shed light on previous inconclusive research, this paper investigates the topic further in a new country setting, that of Switzerland, because the previous results were mostly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. Switzerland is also one of the exemplary countries for executive compensation. Furthermore, it investigates the combined (cascaded) interaction effects of the board size and CEO duality on CEO compensation and market risk from the perspective of managerial power theory, which has not been previously analyzed in the literature to date. For the direct effect, in contrast to previous findings in Anglo-Saxon countries, it has been found that CEOs were not paid for market risk in Switzerland, which confirms agency theory's contracting prediction. This finding outlines the future comparative research area in this domain. For the combined interaction effect, it has been found that board size incorporated with CEO duality is the significant cascaded moderator, and large boards with CEO duality are significantly more effective in controlling asymmetric compensation, which confirms the efficacy of large boards with CEO duality in coping with asymmetric compensation and managerial entrenchment (managerial power theory). These results have both practical and academic implications for boards of directors, Human Resources and corporate governance literature, agency theory, and managerial power theory, by providing further evidence on previous inconclusive findings on board size, CEO duality, and the role of market risk in the CEO pay structure.

The present work aimed to shed light on the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on real earnings management (REM) as well as the moderating role of auditor reputation in the association between BGD and REM using panel data of 1162 French non-financial firm-year observations from the SBF120 index during the period 2005-2019. Our findings show that BGD is negatively related to REM. Furthermore, we found that this relationship is more prominent in firms with higher auditor reputation mainly because highly reputable auditors aim to preserve their image and are more likely to detect earnings management activities.

The underrepresentation of women in power positions means they are not part of shaping the decisions that affect the future of their lives. In the corporate governance sector, gender discrimination still seems far from being eliminated, despite the numerous regulatory interventions that have been recorded in recent years. In 2021, Banca d'Italia updated the circular n. 285/2013 concerning the corporate governance of banks, introducing the prescription of a minimum gender quota both in the boards of directors and in the boards of statutory auditors also for non-listed banks. How do these innovations fit with the existing Italian regulatory framework? And what could be the likely effects that these rules will have on the corporate governance of Italian banks? This research seeks to answer these questions, trying to contextualize the results achieved in comparison with the most relevant issues the literature has found on the relationship between gender equality and corporate governance. As we will see, even if the Banca d'Italia's regulatory intervention seems to be able to produce positive results, it could be not enough to eliminate the unjustified disparities between men and women in corporate governance of Italian non-listed banks.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Purpose: This study aims to test whether the introduction of a gender quota impacts functioning of boards of directors and internal committees thanks to female capacity in effort norms, cognitive conflicts and use of skills. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a difference-in-differences method to trace the staggered mandatory adoption of gender quotas on boards on Italian listed firms, representing the regulative institution pillar of institutional theory. Findings: This paper find that mandatory adopter firms have more frequent internal committee meetings and less frequent board of directors' meetings after the introduction of the law. This confirms that the regulation re-prioritizes work in internal committees, thanks to women effort, capacity to resolution and use of skills. Originality/value: This research provides empirical evidence on female contribution and on the impact that a specific mandatory regulation, as regulative institutional pillar, can have on board organization, showing how gender characteristics influence board functioning in terms of meetings.

Purpose: This study explored how board diversity affects environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in the Italian banking sector. Specifically, this study examined whether the presence of specific corporate governance (CG) characteristics (board diversity) in Italian Cooperative Credit banks is related to ESG dimensions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined a sample of 247 Italian Cooperative Credit banks for the period 2017-2021 and developed an econometric model by applying unbalanced panel data with firm fixed effects and controls per year. To verify the research hypotheses, the authors analyzed board diversity in terms of board attributes variables (size, gender diversity, age, activity, independence and corporate social responsibility/sustainability committee (CSR) and measured ESG dimensions using the ESG score provided by Refinitiv. Findings: The findings suggest that board size, independence and the existence of a CSR/sustainability committee positively affect banks' ESG performance, while no significant relationship between board average age and ESG performance was found. The study also explored how the critical mass of women on a board affects ESG performance by testing the positive impact of gender diversity on ESG dimensions only up to a certain threshold of female directors. Research limitations/implications: This study is highly relevant to managers and investors who consider ESG issues in their decision-making processes. The findings support regulators by offering insights into ways to improve ESG performance through the specific design and application of governance mechanisms. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, this investigation has implications for both practitioners and regulators, suggesting that chief executive officers (CEOs) and managers should pay more attention to CG aspects to improve ESG performance and that policy-makers should give greater consideration to these aspects of CG in their efforts to enhance ESG performance. Originality/value: This study offers an in-depth analysis of banks' ESG practices and attempts to bridge the gap in the literature on ESG in the Italian banking industry. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between CG variables and ESG dimensions in this context. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of gender diversity on boards and on top management positions on excess cash holdings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the quantile regression approach to test the relation between gender diversity and excess cash holding. The sample consists of 1,235 firm-year observations for the period 2005-2017. Findings: The authors find that board gender diversity negatively influences the level of excess cash. This result suggests that women appointed in the boardroom are effective in monitoring managerial actions, including financing policies. The results also show that by forcing companies to have a quota of women on their boards, the presence of women no longer has a negative impact on excess cash holdings. However, when women stand at the chief executive officer or chief financial officer position, they tend to accumulate cash for precautionary motives. These results suggest that women behave differently regarding excess cash holding as monitors compared to their role as decision-makers. Practical implications: The results may be of interest to legislators who may decide to break the glass ceiling, preventing women from gaining greater access to senior management positions. This is in line with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Governance Code of 2020, which strongly recommends the recruitment of women to senior management positions. The results are also important to investors, who might be likely to trust companies in which women hold positions on boards of directors which may increase firm value. The results may also have a social impact. Indeed, the role of women in society may be enhanced if such initiatives are taken to increase their representation on leadership positions and in society in general. Social implications: The results may also have a social impact. Indeed, the role of women in society may be enhanced if such initiatives are taken to increase their representation on leadership positions and in society in general. Originality/value: This study investigates the role of women both as controllers and decision-makers in holding excessive amounts of cash. It also highlights new evidence on the impact the approach of appointing women on boards (enabling/coercive and market-based) can have on the relation between gender diversity and excess cash holdings.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: Do women contribute to performance of companies on which they serve as board of directors? Many prior studies examine this issue, but no consensus is reached on the benefits of women taking on leadership positions. The present study considers this thorny issue from a slightly different perspective. Does the association between gender diversity and business performance vary across sectors and economic cycles? Design/methodology/approach: The sample for this study was derived from the firms included in the S&P Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 300 Index, and the study period of 2004-2016 allowed authors to consider the effects of different sectors as well as different economic cycles on the relationship between gender diversity of boards and business performance. The authors consider the Australian context, which is somewhat unique from the other Western countries, as quotas on boards of directors are not made mandatory and the corporate governance practices are principle-based rather than rule-based. Findings: Employing panel data models, at the aggregate level, the authors find no evidence of board gender diversity impacting business performance. Consideration of sectoral differences and economic cycles in the empirical analyses yielded additional insights. In particular, gender diversity has a beneficial association with performance for businesses in the services and financial sectors after the changes to corporate governance guidelines relating to diversity in 2010. These economic benefits, however, are not evidenced in the resources sector. Research limitations/implications: These findings offer support for critical mass and resource dependence theories. Practical implications: The findings of this study have implications for inclusion and diversity policies of businesses and the society. Specifically, the findings offer support for gender diversity of corporate boards of directors. Originality/value: This study highlights that women bring their unique skills and experiences to create economic value in sectors where they traditionally have more experience and opportunities.

Our paper analyses the characteristics of the boards of directors of the best performing listed Italian banks during the last global financial crisis (from 2008 to 2015). Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the study identifies three different board configurations (archetypes) that these banks adopted: a committee-based board, a gender diversity-based board, and a large size-based board. Although different in some of their characteristics, these configurations share the rationale of favouring the advisory services that the board can provide to managers in their decision-making activities. These services, in turn, are particularly valuable in a time of high risk and uncertainty for banks. With its results, the paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between board characteristics and organisational performance and to a better understanding of the configurations that can best serve when firms' decision-making, for various reasons, becomes particularly complex and can benefit from board support. Our results also contribute to further detail the governance characteristics of banks in the Italian context. Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The goal of this study is to see how gender diversity on bank boards affects the value and profitability of the company. Financial institutions, both public and private, are examined in the study. Data from 28 Indian banks have been analysed for this study. Panel data analysis has been applied to data collected from 2012 to 2020. Private sector banks' stock values suffer when they have more than one woman on their board of directors; public sector banks' stock values benefit when this occurs. Our research demonstrates that ROA has a negative correlation with the gender diversity of boardrooms. We believe this is the first comparative study of its kind in the banking industry to focus on paper. It is recommended that policymakers increase the number of female board members so that they can serve as effective decision makers to improve the firm's performance.

The main objective of the present study is to investigate the board of directors' diversity impact on banks' financial performance. The analysis was made on the Romanian bank system, during 2019 - 2020. The board of directors' diversity was measured through the presence of the woman in the board of directors' structure, average age and the nationality of the board members and the profitability of the bank system was analysed by using the financial indicator ROA (return on assets). The research methodology used was mostly quantitative, with the authors performing a deductive statistical analysis by using a series of testing objectives and potential cause-effect links. The findings of the paper indicate that there is a direct correlation between the board of directors' members average age and ROA, in 2019, and an indirect link with a low intensity between the members' nationality and the bank's profitability, in 2020. Our results provide no evidence for the presence of women on boards of directors and the banks' financial performance. (c) Vilnius University, 2002-2023.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The paper uses the data on 1212 microfinance institutions in 106 developing countries to document the impact of gender diversity on boards and gender diversity among borrowers on nonperforming loans (NPLs) during the period 2010-2018. The results show that microfinance institutions with a higher proportion of female borrowers have fewer NPLs than otherwise similar microfinance institutions with a lower proportion of female borrowers. Regarding female board members, the results show no relationship between the proportion of female board members and NPLs. The findings remain qualitatively the same after several sensitivity checks. We also show that characteristics specific to microfinance institutions moderate the relationship between gender diversity and NPLs. (c) 2023 Borsa Adegstanbul Anonim Azirketi

Research Question/Issue: We approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Research Findings/Insights: We show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state-owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state-owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.

This paper examines the impact of multi-layer corporate governance (MCG) on banks' performance under the global financial crisis (GFC) and COVID-19. Using a random and fixed effects method, we regressed the impact of MCG variables on return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and non-performing loans (NPL) of a panel data of 44 conventional banks (CBs) and 40 Islamic banks (IBs), across 17 countries, and over the period from 2006 to 2020. The results show that board of directors (BoD)' structure has no association with CBs performance whereas the chief executive officer (CEO) duality is strongly negatively impacting CBs performance, especially during the GFC. In addition, supervision framework proxies have a strong positive influence on CBs performance, especially in the period after the GFC. Furthermore, cross-membership and the size of the Shariah board (SB) have a significant negative influence on IBs' performance, but SB qualification has a positive non-significant impact overall--with the exception of NPLs, which had a positive significant impact during the GFC. The supervision position has a favorable impact on IBs performance except during crises. (c) 2022 by the authors.

In traditional models of corporate governance, authority and power flows downwards from the shareholders through the board of directors/supervisory board to executives and then management and eventually the employees. Governance mechanisms are primarily aimed at curtailing agency problems, notably those that arise between owners and self-serving executives or between executives and self-serving managers.

This study investigates the relationship between former chief executive officer (CEO) directors and audit pricing. We find that the former CEO directors negatively impact the company's audit fees. The results do not change after conducting a series of robustness tests. Former CEO directors reduce the company's operating risk, improve the company's earnings quality, and reduce the company's audit fees. Meanwhile, they are more effective at monitoring in companies with less analyst following, lower proportion of female directors, and non-family firms, thus reducing audit fees. Further evidence shows that larger auditors are more likely to reduce audit fees for their clients that have former CEOs retained on the board of directors. (c) 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper contributes empirically to the debate on who should nominate new directors: shareholders or the board? While nomination committees composed of incumbent board members are common around the world, the use of nomination committees composed of shareholders (SNBs) is recommended in several Nordic countries. We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director's performance to company performance.
