A continuous non-limiting soil water supply, or a non-limiting supply from 120 to 180 days after planting, significantly increased (P = 0.01) female flower production of banana cv Robusta compared with continuous soil water stress. Relieving stress after 120 days produced a significantly higher (P = 0.05) average number of female flowers per inflorescence than when adequate water was supplied throughout. Female flower production is positively correlated with the average growth rates at floral initiation and early floral differentiation and with the final pseudostem girth. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao). © 1992 ASEG.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The absorption of the nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) by banana (Musa sp.) cv. Prata Anã explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962) supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) and BAP (3.5 mg/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after inoculation. The seven treatments were arranged on a completely randomized design with three replicates. The sequence of nutrient absorption by the explants was K > N > Ca ≥ P > Mg ≅ S. The P was the nutrient with the fastest absorption rate and at the 30th day the explants had already absorbed 75% of the P from the medium. The P absorption stopped by the 50th day. The S absorption stopped at the 50th day with 66% of it remaining in the medium. The results suggested a close relationship between these two nutrients. The highest rates of nutrient absorption were observed during the first 20 days of culture. The rhizome, pseudostem and leaves behaved differently to the extraction and accumulation of nutrients.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Anã" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Introduction. A project was undertaken to study the nutrient cycling from Musa mother plants to daughter suckers based on the physiological stages of the mother plant. It also reports on the dependency or competition at critical stages of flowering and fruiting and the combinations of different densities and sucker retention at different physiological stages of the mother plant. Materials and methods. A combination of three spacings and five sucker retention phases formed 15 treatments. 32P was given through injection into the mother plant pseudostem. The experiment was carried out over two years, the first being a rain-fed crop and the second being under irrigated conditions. Results. Differential aspects of nutrient cycling were observed between rain-fed and irrigated crops with regard to spacing. In the case of sucker retention phases, in the first year, it was retention at fruit maturity, shooting and flower bud differentiation stages which showed higher radioactivity recovery whereas, in the second year, it was the early phases of retention which showed significantly higher recovery. In the case of interaction effects, in the first year, the highest recovery was found in various combinations of spacing with the stages of bud initiation and shooting and, in the second year, the maximum recovery observed was in the combination of the closest spacing with the stage of flower bud initiation. In both years, recovery was observed in the border row plants. Conclusion. The study confirmed that activity extruded out from the treated plant and was absorbed by the border plants, revealing that nutrient sharing takes place in banana. This result opens up another concept that banana recommendation should not only be at an individual plant level but at block or plot level also. Hastening and improving the efficiency of nutrient cycling to the sucker is suggested as a future line of investigation. © 2002 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. © 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. © 2009 Academic Journals.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Anã, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Anã e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

A field experiment was conducted during 2005-07 to find out the relationship between pseudostem cross-sectional area (PCA) with bunch weight, physico-chemical characteristics of banana fruit, dry matter and nutrient content in leaf, pseudostem and fruit of banana. The pseudostem cross-sectional area (321.58, 327.96, 338.31, 344.20, 348.82, 354.14, 365.57, 376.49, 386.18 and 396.70 cm2) were calculated at 30 cm above the ground level. The bunch weight and physico-chemical properties of fruits improved with increasing the pseudostem cross sectional area from 321.58 to 396.70 cm2. Maximum bunch weight (13.22 kg), number of hands and finger (8.2 and 104.65/bunch), TSS (24.97 °Brix), TSS/acid ratio (227.00); leaf, fruit and pseudostem dry matter content (30.50, 27.58 and 9.42% respectively), leaf nutrient content (N-2.21%, P-0.21% and K-2.04% respectively), fruit nutrient (N-1.16%, P-0.079% and K-1.23% respectively) and pseudostem nutrient content (N-0.66%, P-0.042% and K-1.16%) were recorded in plants with maximum pseudostem cross sectional area. Positive and linear relationship were recorded between pseudostem cross-sectional area and bunch weight, number of fingers, TSS and TSS/acid ratio, whereas negative correlation was observed between pseudostem cross-sectional area and fresh and ripe finger weight, peel and pulp weight and fruit acidity. The maximum fresh and ripe finger weight (152.23 and 137.45 g/finger), peel and pulp weight (18.24 and 119.21 g/finger), finger size (14.75 × 4.38 cm) and titratable acidity (0.16%) were recorded with lowest trunk cross-sectional area.

Banana, irrespective of the varieties, respond very well to the applied nutrients and water, especially at the vegetative stage. Although the crop shows vigorous dry matter production in the early stages of growth, the proportion of dry matter partitioning to reproductive growth is inadequate. Most of the dry matter confines to the pseudostem and foliage resulting in poor bunch size, reduced number of fruits and low fruit quality. In the present study, different levels of nutrients were applied to banana 'Robusta' and treatments were as follows: 150:50:150 g NPK plant-1 (M1), 200:50:200 g NPK plant -1 (M2), 250:50:250 g NPK plant-1 (M3) and 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 (M4) per year as soil application. Bunch treatments comprising spraying of brassinolides 2 ppm (S1), CPPU [1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3- phenylurea] 4 ppm (S2), 2,4-D 10 ppm (S3), 0.5% KH2PO4 (S4), 0.5% KNO3 (S5), 0.5% K2SO4 (S6) and dehanding (retaining six hands in a bunch) apart from soil applied nutrients, were also taken up. The experiments conducted in the plant crop revealed that soil application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in heavier bunch (26.2 kg). The estimated fruit yield was 65.50 t/ha in M4S2 with high B:C ratio of 2.62. The improvement in bunch weight and quality parameters might be due to the spraying of chemicals on bunches combined with the increased dose of N and K application. The growth parameters and physiological characters such as soluble protein and chlorophyll content of leaves at the stage of flowering showed significant difference between different levels of fertilizers (M) but not between the bunch spray (S) treatments. However, significant differences were observed in the interaction effects of M and S. Application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in higher TSS (23 °B) and reduced titrable acidity (0.32%), apart from higher bunch weight.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalán, Veracruz, México. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca≥P≥Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam™) and NFB (Bio-N™) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8±1.02 × 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5±0.80 × 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5± 0.50 × 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

A field experiment was conducted to assess the nutrient uptake pattern and partitioning of nutrients in Ney Poovan banana (AB) at critical growth stages like 10-leaf stage, 20-leaf stage, shooting stage and harvesting stage. From 10-leaf stage to harvesting, the per cent dry matter (DM) accumulation decreased from 42 to 16 in underground segment and increased from 58 to 84 in above ground segment. The sample was partitioned into root, corm, pseudostem, leaf lamina, petiole, peduncle, bunch and male bud, processed and analysed for macro and micronutrients at different critical growth stages. The nutrient accumulation pattern, with respect to dry matter production was worked out. To produce 37.5 t banana ha-1, about 444 kg N, 69 kg P, 933 kg K, 2.4 kg Cu, 7.3 kg Mn, 3.4 kg Fe and 5.9 kg Zn were taken up by Ney Poovan banana. About 10 to 52% removal occurred through bunch harvest from the total nutrient uptake from the soil and remaining nutrients accumulated in the residual tissues were available for in situ recycling. The data provided opportunity for proper fertiliser scheduling to achieve optimum yield with higher nutrient use efficiency and nutrient budgeting in banana ecosystem was also done. © 2018, Horticulture Society of India.

The severity of Fusarium wilt of bananas has long been classified based on visual assessment of necrosis in rhizome or pseudostem cross-sections. The improved method proposed here uses digital image analysis to quantify the proportion of rhizome tissue that is necrotic. It agrees well with visual classification, but provides greater reproducibility, precision and statistical power. © 2019, Australasian Plant Pathology Society Inc.

A field investigation was carried out to study the influence of potassium on growth, yield and quality of Hill banana var. Sirumalai" at Sirumalai hills in Dindugul district during the year 2016-2018. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with nine treatments replicated thrice. The treatments included graded levels of K (@ 390g as control, 450g, 500g, 550g and 600 g/plant) and foliar spray of Sulphate of Potash (SOP @1.5 % twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence along with four levels of K excluding control). The growth, flowering and quality parameters were periodically observed. In general, increase in graded level of K application has enhanced the growth and yield parameters. Treatments with foliar application of SOP showed significant influence when compared with soil application of K alone. Further, the results revealed that the growth characters viz., pseudostem height, pseudostem girth, number of leaves per plant were favorably enhanced by the combined application of K @ 550 g/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%, which was followed by K @ 600 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%. The yield parameters viz., days to bunch harvest, number of fingers per bunch, number of hands per bunch, weight of second hand per bunch, total number of fingers in second hand per bunch, bunch weight and estimated yield were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. Among the treatments application of K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5% recorded the maximum values for all above said characters. The quality parameters viz., middle finger length (cm) and middle finger diameter (cm) of the second hand, TSS and total sugars were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. The results suggested that application K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray @ 1.5% twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence as the best treatment to increase yield and quality of Hill banana var.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

A continuous non-limiting soil water supply, or a non-limiting supply from 120 to 180 days after planting, significantly increased (P = 0.01) female flower production of banana cv Robusta compared with continuous soil water stress. Relieving stress after 120 days produced a significantly higher (P = 0.05) average number of female flowers per inflorescence than when adequate water was supplied throughout. Female flower production is positively correlated with the average growth rates at floral initiation and early floral differentiation and with the final pseudostem girth.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao).

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The absorption of the nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) by banana (Musa sp.) cv. Prata Ana explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962) supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) and BAP (3.5 mg/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after inoculation. The seven treatments were arranged on a completely randomized design with three replicates. The sequence of nutrient absorption by the explants was K > N > Ca >= P > Mg  S. The P was the nutrient with the fastest absorption rate and at the 30th day the explants had already absorbed 75% of the P from the medium. The P absorption stopped by the 50th day. The S absorption stopped at the 50th day with 66% of it remaining in the medium. The results suggested a close relationship between these two nutrients. The highest rates of nutrient absorption were observed during the first 20 days of culture. The rhizome, pseudostem and leaves behaved differently to the extraction and accumulation of nutrients.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Ana" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Introduction. A project was undertaken to study the nutrient cycling from Musa mother plants to daughter suckers based on the physiological stages of the mother plant. It also reports on the dependency or competition at critical stages of flowering and fruiting and the combinations of different densities and sucker retention at different physiological stages of the mother plant. Materials and methods. A combination of three spacings and five sucker retention phases formed 15 treatments. 32P was given through injection into the mother plant pseudostem. The experiment was carried out over two years, the first being a rain-fed crop and the second being under irrigated conditions. Results. Differential aspects of nutrient cycling were observed between rain-fed and irrigated crops with regard to spacing. In the case of sucker retention phases, in the first year, it was retention at fruit maturity, shooting and flower bud differentiation stages which showed higher radioactivity recovery whereas, in the second year, it was the early phases of retention which showed significantly higher recovery. In the case of interaction effects, in the first year, the highest recovery was found in various combinations of spacing with the stages of bud initiation and shooting and, in the second year, the maximum recovery observed was in the combination of the closest spacing with the stage of flower bud initiation. In both years, recovery was observed in the border row plants. Conclusion. The study confirmed that activity extruded out from the treated plant and was absorbed by the border plants, revealing that nutrient sharing takes place in banana. This result opens up another concept that banana recommendation should not only be at an individual plant level but at block or plot level also. Hastening and improving the efficiency of nutrient cycling to the sucker is suggested as a future line of investigation. (c) 2002 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. (c) 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. (c) 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. (c) 2009 Academic Journals.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Ana, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Ana e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

A field experiment was conducted during 2005-07 to find out the relationship between pseudostem cross-sectional area (PCA) with bunch weight, physico-chemical characteristics of banana fruit, dry matter and nutrient content in leaf, pseudostem and fruit of banana. The pseudostem cross-sectional area (321.58, 327.96, 338.31, 344.20, 348.82, 354.14, 365.57, 376.49, 386.18 and 396.70 cm2) were calculated at 30 cm above the ground level. The bunch weight and physico-chemical properties of fruits improved with increasing the pseudostem cross sectional area from 321.58 to 396.70 cm2. Maximum bunch weight (13.22 kg), number of hands and finger (8.2 and 104.65/bunch), TSS (24.97 degBrix), TSS/acid ratio (227.00); leaf, fruit and pseudostem dry matter content (30.50, 27.58 and 9.42% respectively), leaf nutrient content (N-2.21%, P-0.21% and K-2.04% respectively), fruit nutrient (N-1.16%, P-0.079% and K-1.23% respectively) and pseudostem nutrient content (N-0.66%, P-0.042% and K-1.16%) were recorded in plants with maximum pseudostem cross sectional area. Positive and linear relationship were recorded between pseudostem cross-sectional area and bunch weight, number of fingers, TSS and TSS/acid ratio, whereas negative correlation was observed between pseudostem cross-sectional area and fresh and ripe finger weight, peel and pulp weight and fruit acidity. The maximum fresh and ripe finger weight (152.23 and 137.45 g/finger), peel and pulp weight (18.24 and 119.21 g/finger), finger size (14.75 x 4.38 cm) and titratable acidity (0.16%) were recorded with lowest trunk cross-sectional area.

Banana, irrespective of the varieties, respond very well to the applied nutrients and water, especially at the vegetative stage. Although the crop shows vigorous dry matter production in the early stages of growth, the proportion of dry matter partitioning to reproductive growth is inadequate. Most of the dry matter confines to the pseudostem and foliage resulting in poor bunch size, reduced number of fruits and low fruit quality. In the present study, different levels of nutrients were applied to banana 'Robusta' and treatments were as follows: 150:50:150 g NPK plant-1 (M1), 200:50:200 g NPK plant -1 (M2), 250:50:250 g NPK plant-1 (M3) and 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 (M4) per year as soil application. Bunch treatments comprising spraying of brassinolides 2 ppm (S1), CPPU [1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3- phenylurea] 4 ppm (S2), 2,4-D 10 ppm (S3), 0.5% KH2PO4 (S4), 0.5% KNO3 (S5), 0.5% K2SO4 (S6) and dehanding (retaining six hands in a bunch) apart from soil applied nutrients, were also taken up. The experiments conducted in the plant crop revealed that soil application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in heavier bunch (26.2 kg). The estimated fruit yield was 65.50 t/ha in M4S2 with high B:C ratio of 2.62. The improvement in bunch weight and quality parameters might be due to the spraying of chemicals on bunches combined with the increased dose of N and K application. The growth parameters and physiological characters such as soluble protein and chlorophyll content of leaves at the stage of flowering showed significant difference between different levels of fertilizers (M) but not between the bunch spray (S) treatments. However, significant differences were observed in the interaction effects of M and S. Application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in higher TSS (23 degB) and reduced titrable acidity (0.32%), apart from higher bunch weight.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalan, Veracruz, Mexico. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca>=P>=Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam(tm)) and NFB (Bio-N(tm)) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8+-1.02 x 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5+-0.80 x 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5+- 0.50 x 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Ana' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Ana' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

A field experiment was conducted to assess the nutrient uptake pattern and partitioning of nutrients in Ney Poovan banana (AB) at critical growth stages like 10-leaf stage, 20-leaf stage, shooting stage and harvesting stage. From 10-leaf stage to harvesting, the per cent dry matter (DM) accumulation decreased from 42 to 16 in underground segment and increased from 58 to 84 in above ground segment. The sample was partitioned into root, corm, pseudostem, leaf lamina, petiole, peduncle, bunch and male bud, processed and analysed for macro and micronutrients at different critical growth stages. The nutrient accumulation pattern, with respect to dry matter production was worked out. To produce 37.5 t banana ha-1, about 444 kg N, 69 kg P, 933 kg K, 2.4 kg Cu, 7.3 kg Mn, 3.4 kg Fe and 5.9 kg Zn were taken up by Ney Poovan banana. About 10 to 52% removal occurred through bunch harvest from the total nutrient uptake from the soil and remaining nutrients accumulated in the residual tissues were available for in situ recycling. The data provided opportunity for proper fertiliser scheduling to achieve optimum yield with higher nutrient use efficiency and nutrient budgeting in banana ecosystem was also done.

A field investigation was carried out to study the influence of potassium on growth, yield and quality of Hill banana var. Sirumalai" at Sirumalai hills in Dindugul district during the year 2016-2018. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with nine treatments replicated thrice. The treatments included graded levels of K (@ 390g as control, 450g, 500g, 550g and 600 g/plant) and foliar spray of Sulphate of Potash (SOP @1.5 % twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence along with four levels of K excluding control). The growth, flowering and quality parameters were periodically observed. In general, increase in graded level of K application has enhanced the growth and yield parameters. Treatments with foliar application of SOP showed significant influence when compared with soil application of K alone. Further, the results revealed that the growth characters viz., pseudostem height, pseudostem girth, number of leaves per plant were favorably enhanced by the combined application of K @ 550 g/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%, which was followed by K @ 600 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%. The yield parameters viz., days to bunch harvest, number of fingers per bunch, number of hands per bunch, weight of second hand per bunch, total number of fingers in second hand per bunch, bunch weight and estimated yield were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. Among the treatments application of K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5% recorded the maximum values for all above said characters. The quality parameters viz., middle finger length (cm) and middle finger diameter (cm) of the second hand, TSS and total sugars were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. The results suggested that application K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray @ 1.5% twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence as the best treatment to increase yield and quality of Hill banana var.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

A continuous non-limiting soil water supply, or a non-limiting supply from 120 to 180 days after planting, significantly increased (P = 0.01) female flower production of banana cv Robusta compared with continuous soil water stress. Relieving stress after 120 days produced a significantly higher (P = 0.05) average number of female flowers per inflorescence than when adequate water was supplied throughout. Female flower production is positively correlated with the average growth rates at floral initiation and early floral differentiation and with the final pseudostem girth.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao).

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

Prata Ana explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962) supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) and BAP (3.5 mg/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after inoculation. The seven treatments were arranged on a completely randomized design with three replicates. The sequence of nutrient absorption by the explants was K > N > Ca >= P > Mg  S. The P was the nutrient with the fastest absorption rate and at the 30th day the explants had already absorbed 75% of the P from the medium. The P absorption stopped by the 50th day. The S absorption stopped at the 50th day with 66% of it remaining in the medium. The results suggested a close relationship between these two nutrients. The highest rates of nutrient absorption were observed during the first 20 days of culture. The rhizome, pseudostem and leaves behaved differently to the extraction and accumulation of nutrients.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Ana" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Introduction. A project was undertaken to study the nutrient cycling from Musa mother plants to daughter suckers based on the physiological stages of the mother plant. It also reports on the dependency or competition at critical stages of flowering and fruiting and the combinations of different densities and sucker retention at different physiological stages of the mother plant. Materials and methods. A combination of three spacings and five sucker retention phases formed 15 treatments. 32P was given through injection into the mother plant pseudostem. The experiment was carried out over two years, the first being a rain-fed crop and the second being under irrigated conditions. Results. Differential aspects of nutrient cycling were observed between rain-fed and irrigated crops with regard to spacing. In the case of sucker retention phases, in the first year, it was retention at fruit maturity, shooting and flower bud differentiation stages which showed higher radioactivity recovery whereas, in the second year, it was the early phases of retention which showed significantly higher recovery. In the case of interaction effects, in the first year, the highest recovery was found in various combinations of spacing with the stages of bud initiation and shooting and, in the second year, the maximum recovery observed was in the combination of the closest spacing with the stage of flower bud initiation. In both years, recovery was observed in the border row plants. Conclusion. The study confirmed that activity extruded out from the treated plant and was absorbed by the border plants, revealing that nutrient sharing takes place in banana. This result opens up another concept that banana recommendation should not only be at an individual plant level but at block or plot level also. Hastening and improving the efficiency of nutrient cycling to the sucker is suggested as a future line of investigation. (c) 2002 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. (c) 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. (c) 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. (c) 2009 Academic Journals.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Ana, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Ana e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

A field experiment was conducted during 2005-07 to find out the relationship between pseudostem cross-sectional area (PCA) with bunch weight, physico-chemical characteristics of banana fruit, dry matter and nutrient content in leaf, pseudostem and fruit of banana. The pseudostem cross-sectional area (321.58, 327.96, 338.31, 344.20, 348.82, 354.14, 365.57, 376.49, 386.18 and 396.70 cm2) were calculated at 30 cm above the ground level. The bunch weight and physico-chemical properties of fruits improved with increasing the pseudostem cross sectional area from 321.58 to 396.70 cm2. Maximum bunch weight (13.22 kg), number of hands and finger (8.2 and 104.65/bunch), TSS (24.97 degBrix), TSS/acid ratio (227.00); leaf, fruit and pseudostem dry matter content (30.50, 27.58 and 9.42% respectively), leaf nutrient content (N-2.21%, P-0.21% and K-2.04% respectively), fruit nutrient (N-1.16%, P-0.079% and K-1.23% respectively) and pseudostem nutrient content (N-0.66%, P-0.042% and K-1.16%) were recorded in plants with maximum pseudostem cross sectional area. Positive and linear relationship were recorded between pseudostem cross-sectional area and bunch weight, number of fingers, TSS and TSS/acid ratio, whereas negative correlation was observed between pseudostem cross-sectional area and fresh and ripe finger weight, peel and pulp weight and fruit acidity. The maximum fresh and ripe finger weight (152.23 and 137.45 g/finger), peel and pulp weight (18.24 and 119.21 g/finger), finger size (14.75 x 4.38 cm) and titratable acidity (0.16%) were recorded with lowest trunk cross-sectional area.

Banana, irrespective of the varieties, respond very well to the applied nutrients and water, especially at the vegetative stage. Although the crop shows vigorous dry matter production in the early stages of growth, the proportion of dry matter partitioning to reproductive growth is inadequate. Most of the dry matter confines to the pseudostem and foliage resulting in poor bunch size, reduced number of fruits and low fruit quality. In the present study, different levels of nutrients were applied to banana 'Robusta' and treatments were as follows: 150:50:150 g NPK plant-1 (M1), 200:50:200 g NPK plant -1 (M2), 250:50:250 g NPK plant-1 (M3) and 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 (M4) per year as soil application. Bunch treatments comprising spraying of brassinolides 2 ppm (S1), CPPU [1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3- phenylurea] 4 ppm (S2), 2,4-D 10 ppm (S3), 0.5% KH2PO4 (S4), 0.5% KNO3 (S5), 0.5% K2SO4 (S6) and dehanding (retaining six hands in a bunch) apart from soil applied nutrients, were also taken up. The experiments conducted in the plant crop revealed that soil application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in heavier bunch (26.2 kg). The estimated fruit yield was 65.50 t/ha in M4S2 with high B:C ratio of 2.62. The improvement in bunch weight and quality parameters might be due to the spraying of chemicals on bunches combined with the increased dose of N and K application. The growth parameters and physiological characters such as soluble protein and chlorophyll content of leaves at the stage of flowering showed significant difference between different levels of fertilizers (M) but not between the bunch spray (S) treatments. However, significant differences were observed in the interaction effects of M and S. Application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in higher TSS (23 degB) and reduced titrable acidity (0.32%), apart from higher bunch weight.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalan, Veracruz, Mexico. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca>=P>=Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam(tm)) and NFB (Bio-N(tm)) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8+-1.02 x 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5+-0.80 x 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5+- 0.50 x 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Ana' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Ana' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

A field experiment was conducted to assess the nutrient uptake pattern and partitioning of nutrients in Ney Poovan banana (AB) at critical growth stages like 10-leaf stage, 20-leaf stage, shooting stage and harvesting stage. From 10-leaf stage to harvesting, the per cent dry matter (DM) accumulation decreased from 42 to 16 in underground segment and increased from 58 to 84 in above ground segment. The sample was partitioned into root, corm, pseudostem, leaf lamina, petiole, peduncle, bunch and male bud, processed and analysed for macro and micronutrients at different critical growth stages. The nutrient accumulation pattern, with respect to dry matter production was worked out. To produce 37.5 t banana ha-1, about 444 kg N, 69 kg P, 933 kg K, 2.4 kg Cu, 7.3 kg Mn, 3.4 kg Fe and 5.9 kg Zn were taken up by Ney Poovan banana. About 10 to 52% removal occurred through bunch harvest from the total nutrient uptake from the soil and remaining nutrients accumulated in the residual tissues were available for in situ recycling. The data provided opportunity for proper fertiliser scheduling to achieve optimum yield with higher nutrient use efficiency and nutrient budgeting in banana ecosystem was also done.

The severity of Fusarium wilt of bananas has long been classified based on visual assessment of necrosis in rhizome or pseudostem cross-sections. The improved method proposed here uses digital image analysis to quantify the proportion of rhizome tissue that is necrotic. It agrees well with visual classification, but provides greater reproducibility, precision and statistical power. (c) 2019, Australasian Plant Pathology Society Inc.

A field investigation was carried out to study the influence of potassium on growth, yield and quality of Hill banana var. Sirumalai" at Sirumalai hills in Dindugul district during the year 2016-2018. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with nine treatments replicated thrice. The treatments included graded levels of K (@ 390g as control, 450g, 500g, 550g and 600 g/plant) and foliar spray of Sulphate of Potash (SOP @1.5 % twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence along with four levels of K excluding control). The growth, flowering and quality parameters were periodically observed. In general, increase in graded level of K application has enhanced the growth and yield parameters. Treatments with foliar application of SOP showed significant influence when compared with soil application of K alone. Further, the results revealed that the growth characters viz., pseudostem height, pseudostem girth, number of leaves per plant were favorably enhanced by the combined application of K @ 550 g/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%, which was followed by K @ 600 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%. The yield parameters viz., days to bunch harvest, number of fingers per bunch, number of hands per bunch, weight of second hand per bunch, total number of fingers in second hand per bunch, bunch weight and estimated yield were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. Among the treatments application of K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5% recorded the maximum values for all above said characters. The quality parameters viz., middle finger length (cm) and middle finger diameter (cm) of the second hand, TSS and total sugars were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. The results suggested that application K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray @ 1.5% twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence as the best treatment to increase yield and quality of Hill banana var.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.
