Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers. © 2004 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

The objective of this work was to characterize and evaluate the behavior of 13 banana genotypes (varieties and hybrids) AAA, AAAA, AAB and AAAB genomic groups, in two production cycles in southwest Bahia, using relevant phenotypic descriptors for the identification and selection of superior individuals. The Prata Anã and Pacovan (AAB), Grande Naine and Nanicão (AAA) varieties and the hybrids PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Japira, Preciosa and ST12-31 (AAAB) and Ambrosia, Calipso, Bucaneiro and FHIA-02 (AAAA), selected at Embrapa Cassava and Fruit Crops, were evaluated. The experimental design was in random blocks, with 13 treatments, five repetitions, 20 plants per plot, six useful and 3.00 m x 2.00 m spacing. The following characteristics were considered: Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of live leaves during flowering and harvest, number of days from planting to flowering and until harvest, bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, weight, length and diameter of fruit. Grande Naine, and Nanicão stood out for the characteristics of bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, fruit weight and length; the FHIA-02 hybrid presented greater fruit diameter in both production cycles and the earliest flowering and harvest in the second cycle; Calipso was the latest for harvest; ST12-31 was the tallest in height; the Prata Anã variety stood out for number of live leaves during flowering and harvest; the Prata type hybrids, PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Preciosa and Japira, stood out for the parameters related to fruit quality when compared to its genitors Prata Anã and Pacovan, respectively; there was an increment of the parameters that reflected vegetative growth and yield from the first to the second production cycle for all genotypes evaluated.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65°C until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' × 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense). © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease. © Cirad / EDP Sciences 2015.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005–2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop. © 2020, Prof. H.S.

Bananas and plantains are important staple crops for many people in developing countries, but these crops are severely affected by biotic constraints that reduce productivity. A major biotic stress is the banana corm borer weevil (C. sordidus) whose larvae eat corm/pseudostem tissues that eventually weaken the plants and cause toppling.To manage these borer weevils, most farmers use synthetic pesticides with active ingredients from different pesticide groups. Over reliance and abusive use of pesticides result in detrimental effects on the environment and human health.These effects together with ecological backlashes such as development of resistance by the pest have led to numerous advocacies to minimize the use of these chemicals. To achieve this, there has been increasing number of researches to seek sustainable alternatives that could be used to replace these synthetic pesticides or be integrated with less toxic chemicals to effectively manage the pest. This review summarizes global research on the use of synthetic pesticides and alternative management techniques such as the use of appropriate cultural practices (e.g., clean planting materials,fallowing,mulching,intercropping,and trapping),botanical pesticides (e.g.,from Solanaceae, Asteraceae, and Meliaceae), entomopathogens, predators/parasitoids, and the use of resistant crop varieties, as well as possibilities of engineering phytocystatins to produce transgenic varieties that will be harmful to weevil.The review ends with conclusions, limitations/gaps, and recommendations for future research for the different alternative options. © CAB International 2020.

Protected cultivation (in greenhouses) is an effective cropping system to produce bananas in Turkey and much more profitable than open-field conditions. ‘Grand Nain’ is the most popular cultivar grown in greenhouses in Turkey, but it may be possible to increase yield and fruit quality, and subsequently grower incomes, by testing new cultivars. The objective of this study was to evaluate in subtropical conditions the performance of five new Cavendish cultivars (‘CV 902’, ‘Jobo, MA13’, ‘Williams’ and ‘MA13’) previously selected in open-field tropical conditions, compared to ‘Grand Nain’ (control). All new Cavendish cultivars were introduced in Turkey from VITROPIC SA, France. All cultivars were produced by in vitro micropropagation of meristems, and then deflasked and grown in nurseries to 25 cm for planting. The trials were undertaken in three different locations (Alanya, Anamur and Bozyazı, Turkey) in greenhouses. Various parameters were recorded over two crop cycles including: stem circumference, stem height, total leaf number, bunch stem circumference, number of hands and finger per bunch, finger length and circumference at harvest and bunch weight. The Bozyazı location showed better performance in many aspects of plant growth compared to the other two sites. ‘Williams’ had on average the highest pseudostem circumference and height but also the highest bunch weight (50.27 kg). The bunch weight of ‘MA13’ and ‘CV 902’ was 47.65 and 42.66 kg, respectively, whereas the control (‘Grand Nain’) and ‘Jobo’ had a lower bunch weight. ‘Williams’, ‘MA13’ and ‘CV 902’ were more productive than ‘Grand Nain’ in greenhouse conditions. In addition, no somaclonal variations were observed in any of the three experimental locations. These results suggest that the new selections have potential to provide higher yields in Turkey in protected cultivation, providing higher returns to growers, compared to local selections. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars. © 2021 Indonesian Journal of Agricultural Science.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at α = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. © 2022 by authors.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers.

The objective of this work was to characterize and evaluate the behavior of 13 banana genotypes (varieties and hybrids) AAA, AAAA, AAB and AAAB genomic groups, in two production cycles in southwest Bahia, using relevant phenotypic descriptors for the identification and selection of superior individuals. The Prata Ana and Pacovan (AAB), Grande Naine and Nanicao (AAA) varieties and the hybrids PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Japira, Preciosa and ST12-31 (AAAB) and Ambrosia, Calipso, Bucaneiro and FHIA-02 (AAAA), selected at Embrapa Cassava and Fruit Crops, were evaluated. The experimental design was in random blocks, with 13 treatments, five repetitions, 20 plants per plot, six useful and 3.00 m x 2.00 m spacing. The following characteristics were considered: Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of live leaves during flowering and harvest, number of days from planting to flowering and until harvest, bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, weight, length and diameter of fruit. Grande Naine, and Nanicao stood out for the characteristics of bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, fruit weight and length; the FHIA-02 hybrid presented greater fruit diameter in both production cycles and the earliest flowering and harvest in the second cycle; Calipso was the latest for harvest; ST12-31 was the tallest in height; the Prata Ana variety stood out for number of live leaves during flowering and harvest; the Prata type hybrids, PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Preciosa and Japira, stood out for the parameters related to fruit quality when compared to its genitors Prata Ana and Pacovan, respectively; there was an increment of the parameters that reflected vegetative growth and yield from the first to the second production cycle for all genotypes evaluated.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abaca) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65degC until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3x2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Ana' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Ana shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' x 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. (c) 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense).

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28+-2.01, 41.56+-2.55); phytates (3.78+-0.05, 3.23+-0.33); tannins (7.99+-0.26, 6.55+-0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47+-0.14, 1.44+-0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods.

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005-2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop.

Bananas and plantains are important staple crops for many people in developing countries, but these crops are severely affected by biotic constraints that reduce productivity. A major biotic stress is the banana corm borer weevil (C. sordidus) whose larvae eat corm/pseudostem tissues that eventually weaken the plants and cause toppling.To manage these borer weevils, most farmers use synthetic pesticides with active ingredients from different pesticide groups. Over reliance and abusive use of pesticides result in detrimental effects on the environment and human health.These effects together with ecological backlashes such as development of resistance by the pest have led to numerous advocacies to minimize the use of these chemicals. To achieve this, there has been increasing number of researches to seek sustainable alternatives that could be used to replace these synthetic pesticides or be integrated with less toxic chemicals to effectively manage the pest. This review summarizes global research on the use of synthetic pesticides and alternative management techniques such as the use of appropriate cultural practices (e.g., clean planting materials,fallowing,mulching,intercropping,and trapping),botanical pesticides (e.g.,from Solanaceae, Asteraceae, and Meliaceae), entomopathogens, predators/parasitoids, and the use of resistant crop varieties, as well as possibilities of engineering phytocystatins to produce transgenic varieties that will be harmful to weevil.The review ends with conclusions, limitations/gaps, and recommendations for future research for the different alternative options.

Protected cultivation (in greenhouses) is an effective cropping system to produce bananas in Turkey and much more profitable than open-field conditions. 'Grand Nain' is the most popular cultivar grown in greenhouses in Turkey, but it may be possible to increase yield and fruit quality, and subsequently grower incomes, by testing new cultivars. The objective of this study was to evaluate in subtropical conditions the performance of five new Cavendish cultivars ('CV 902', 'Jobo, MA13', 'Williams' and 'MA13') previously selected in open-field tropical conditions, compared to 'Grand Nain' (control). All new Cavendish cultivars were introduced in Turkey from VITROPIC SA, France. All cultivars were produced by in vitro micropropagation of meristems, and then deflasked and grown in nurseries to 25 cm for planting. The trials were undertaken in three different locations (Alanya, Anamur and Bozyazi, Turkey) in greenhouses. Various parameters were recorded over two crop cycles including: stem circumference, stem height, total leaf number, bunch stem circumference, number of hands and finger per bunch, finger length and circumference at harvest and bunch weight. The Bozyazi location showed better performance in many aspects of plant growth compared to the other two sites. 'Williams' had on average the highest pseudostem circumference and height but also the highest bunch weight (50.27 kg). The bunch weight of 'MA13' and 'CV 902' was 47.65 and 42.66 kg, respectively, whereas the control ('Grand Nain') and 'Jobo' had a lower bunch weight. 'Williams', 'MA13' and 'CV 902' were more productive than 'Grand Nain' in greenhouse conditions. In addition, no somaclonal variations were observed in any of the three experimental locations. These results suggest that the new selections have potential to provide higher yields in Turkey in protected cultivation, providing higher returns to growers, compared to local selections.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at a = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. (c) 2022 by authors.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5-100% accuracy levels.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers.

The objective of this work was to characterize and evaluate the behavior of 13 banana genotypes (varieties and hybrids) AAA, AAAA, AAB and AAAB genomic groups, in two production cycles in southwest Bahia, using relevant phenotypic descriptors for the identification and selection of superior individuals. The Prata Ana and Pacovan (AAB), Grande Naine and Nanicao (AAA) varieties and the hybrids PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Japira, Preciosa and ST12-31 (AAAB) and Ambrosia, Calipso, Bucaneiro and FHIA-02 (AAAA), selected at Embrapa Cassava and Fruit Crops, were evaluated. The experimental design was in random blocks, with 13 treatments, five repetitions, 20 plants per plot, six useful and 3.00 m x 2.00 m spacing. The following characteristics were considered: Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of live leaves during flowering and harvest, number of days from planting to flowering and until harvest, bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, weight, length and diameter of fruit. Grande Naine, and Nanicao stood out for the characteristics of bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, fruit weight and length; the FHIA-02 hybrid presented greater fruit diameter in both production cycles and the earliest flowering and harvest in the second cycle; Calipso was the latest for harvest; ST12-31 was the tallest in height; the Prata Ana variety stood out for number of live leaves during flowering and harvest; the Prata type hybrids, PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Preciosa and Japira, stood out for the parameters related to fruit quality when compared to its genitors Prata Ana and Pacovan, respectively; there was an increment of the parameters that reflected vegetative growth and yield from the first to the second production cycle for all genotypes evaluated.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abaca) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65degC until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3x2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Ana' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Ana shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' x 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. (c) 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense).

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28+-2.01, 41.56+-2.55); phytates (3.78+-0.05, 3.23+-0.33); tannins (7.99+-0.26, 6.55+-0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47+-0.14, 1.44+-0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods.

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005-2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop.

Bananas and plantains are important staple crops for many people in developing countries, but these crops are severely affected by biotic constraints that reduce productivity. A major biotic stress is the banana corm borer weevil (C. sordidus) whose larvae eat corm/pseudostem tissues that eventually weaken the plants and cause toppling.To manage these borer weevils, most farmers use synthetic pesticides with active ingredients from different pesticide groups. Over reliance and abusive use of pesticides result in detrimental effects on the environment and human health.These effects together with ecological backlashes such as development of resistance by the pest have led to numerous advocacies to minimize the use of these chemicals. To achieve this, there has been increasing number of researches to seek sustainable alternatives that could be used to replace these synthetic pesticides or be integrated with less toxic chemicals to effectively manage the pest. This review summarizes global research on the use of synthetic pesticides and alternative management techniques such as the use of appropriate cultural practices (e.g., clean planting materials,fallowing,mulching,intercropping,and trapping),botanical pesticides (e.g.,from Solanaceae, Asteraceae, and Meliaceae), entomopathogens, predators/parasitoids, and the use of resistant crop varieties, as well as possibilities of engineering phytocystatins to produce transgenic varieties that will be harmful to weevil.The review ends with conclusions, limitations/gaps, and recommendations for future research for the different alternative options.

Protected cultivation (in greenhouses) is an effective cropping system to produce bananas in Turkey and much more profitable than open-field conditions. 'Grand Nain' is the most popular cultivar grown in greenhouses in Turkey, but it may be possible to increase yield and fruit quality, and subsequently grower incomes, by testing new cultivars. The objective of this study was to evaluate in subtropical conditions the performance of five new Cavendish cultivars ('CV 902', 'Jobo, MA13', 'Williams' and 'MA13') previously selected in open-field tropical conditions, compared to 'Grand Nain' (control). All new Cavendish cultivars were introduced in Turkey from VITROPIC SA, France. All cultivars were produced by in vitro micropropagation of meristems, and then deflasked and grown in nurseries to 25 cm for planting. The trials were undertaken in three different locations (Alanya, Anamur and Bozyazi, Turkey) in greenhouses. Various parameters were recorded over two crop cycles including: stem circumference, stem height, total leaf number, bunch stem circumference, number of hands and finger per bunch, finger length and circumference at harvest and bunch weight. The Bozyazi location showed better performance in many aspects of plant growth compared to the other two sites. 'Williams' had on average the highest pseudostem circumference and height but also the highest bunch weight (50.27 kg). The bunch weight of 'MA13' and 'CV 902' was 47.65 and 42.66 kg, respectively, whereas the control ('Grand Nain') and 'Jobo' had a lower bunch weight. 'Williams', 'MA13' and 'CV 902' were more productive than 'Grand Nain' in greenhouse conditions. In addition, no somaclonal variations were observed in any of the three experimental locations. These results suggest that the new selections have potential to provide higher yields in Turkey in protected cultivation, providing higher returns to growers, compared to local selections.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at a = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. (c) 2022 by authors.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5-100% accuracy levels.
