Fire resisting property was imparted to cellulosic paper by the application of a bio-enriched version of a banana pseudostem sap (BPS) as well as the only BPS, obtained as a byproduct during fibre extraction from the pseudostem. The papers were evaluated for their flame retardant property by measurement of limiting oxygen index and vertical flammability. They were also characterized by thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The bio-enriched BPS treated paper was found to exhibit a better flame retardancy with distinguished char length, compared to the control and the only BPS treated paper. The impartment of flame resisting property to a paper by the BPS, along with its charring behaviour has been discussed and the mechanism thereon has been postulated. The BPS application was found to enhance the oxygen required for the burning of the paper and reduce its burning rate by promoting more dehydration and char formation. The imparted fire retardant finish found durable to weathering, did not cause any significant loss in tear and tensile properties of the paper. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to use the natural wastage plant product, bannana pseudostem sap (BPS) for using as fire retardant of cellulosic textile substrate. The study aims to use first time any wastage plant product for making fire retardant cellulosic textile. In this regard flame retardant functionality was imparted in cellulosic textile using BPS, an eco-friendly natural wastage product. Design/methodology/approach - The extracted sap was made alkaline and applied in pre-mordanted bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics. Flame retardant properties of the control and treated fabrics were analyzed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability and total heat of combustion using bomb calorimeter. The thermal degradation and pyrolysis was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical composition of the control and BPS treated cellulosic fabric were analyzed by FTIR, SEM and EDX. Durability of the flame retardant functionality to soap washing had also been studied. Findings - The study showed that the treated fabrics had good flame retardant property compared to control fabrics. The LOI value was found to increase by 1.6 times after application of BPS. As a result of this, the fabric does not catch flame. In horizontal flammability, the treated fabric showed burning with afterglow (without presence of flame) with a propagation rate of 7.5 mm/min, which is almost ten times lower than the control fabric. After application of BPS cellulosic fabric sample produced natural khaki colour. There was no significant change in other physical properties. Practical implications - The application process is simple and cost-effective as no costly chemicals were used. Further advantage is that the treated fabric could also be considered as natural dyed cotton fabric. The developed khaki colour is quite attractive and stable to sun light exposure. This developed process could used in colouration and flame retardant finishing of home furnishing products such as home-window curtain, railway curtain, hospital curtain, table lamp and as a covering material of non-permanent structure like in book fair, festival, religious purpose, etc., where large quantity of textile is used and has chance of fire hazards. Social implications - BPS abundantly available in Indian as well as other countries and it is normally considered as waste material. It is eco-friendly and produced from renewable source. Therefore, the application of BPS in cotton textile for colouration and functionalization will give the advantages of value addition using natural product. Rural people will be benifited lot by applying this technology whenever it required. Originality/value - This paper helps to clarify first time why and how a wastage plant product like BPS can be used for preparing fire retardant cotton cellulosic fabric. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Flame retardancy was imparted to ligno-cellulosic jute textiles using banana pseudostem sap (BPS), an eco-friendly natural by-product obtained during the extraction of fibres from the banana pseudostem. The extracted sap was made alkaline and applied to a pre-mordanted Greige fabric. The flame-retardant properties of both the control and treated fabrics were analysed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability, and the total heat of combustion. The treated jute fabrics showed a far better flame-retardant property compared to the control fabric. By 1.9 times increase in the LOI after application of the alkaline BPS, the treated fabric (1: 4) showed no flame and got self-extinguished within a minute. Based on thermal degradation, pyrolysis and dehydration studies, and analysis of the chemical composition of the flame-retardant finish prepared from the BPS, the mechanism of imparting flame retardancy to jute textiles has been postulated. The imparted finish was found semi-durable in soap wash, and did not cause any significant loss in tensile and tear strength of the fabric.

Waste is a substance that is considered by all as unwanted or additional material arising out of any industrial or agricultural operation process, product, by-product, or any other item at the end of their requisite service life. In a country such as the United Kingdom, about 4–5 % of municipal solid waste is composed of clothes/textiles, 25 % of which is recycled. A large amount of unutilised/processed material is generated in the agricultural, food processing, paper–pulp, and textile industries as waste or residue, such as lignin, sericin, dyes, sizing paste, leather fibre, banana pseudostem sap, cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic short to long biofibres, corncob, tomato seed and peel, and many others. The disposal of such waste or residue creates serious environmental pollution, either during their natural degradation, through the microbial pathway, or through incineration. As many of the agro, food, textile, and paper–pulp processing wastes or residues have high technical potential to be used for many diversified end-applications, they have been seriously considered through R&D efforts and application for the production of nanocellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, bacterial cellulose, recovery of dyes, water purification, biodegradable hard and flexible composites, substrates for tissue engineering, recycled textiles, UV protective and antimicrobial agents, binder and biodegradable pots for transplanting of plants, and so on. Life-cycle assessment has also been explored to analyse the environmental performances of different shopping bags. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.

In the last few decades, people have become more concerned about their health, hygiene, lifestyle, fashion, comfort, luxury, and wellbeing. Those belonging to economically well-off sections are more often choosing to buy luxurious textiles, not only to exhibit their high social and well-off strata, but also from the compulsion in health and hygienic necessity of the present day. In the production of luxurious textiles, natural fibres like cotton, silk and wool, and man-made fibres, like polyester, acrylic and regenerated rayon (viscose) play important roles. Recently, due to the rapid growth of nanoscience and technology, various organic and inorganic nanoparticles, such as silver (Ag), TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, lignin, and Chitosan have been applied to impart attributes needed for health and hygiene, UV protection, self-cleaned, and skin-care functionalities, both in natural and synthetic textiles. Similarly, various plant molecules, biomaterials and bio-polymers, such as banana pseudostem sap (BPS), grape and mulberry fruit extracts, natural dyes, Chitosan, tulsi, silk-sericin, aloe Vera, honey, almonds, cucumber, and mint have been applied in textiles for improvement in antimicrobial, UV-protective, antioxidant, skin-nourishing, and hydrophilic properties. Natural extracts of jasmine, lavender, Champa sandalwood and such others containing active ingredients like santalols, fusanol, santene, teresantol, benzyl acetate, linalool, linalyl acetate, and benzyl benzoate have also been added in textiles for their mind-refreshing fragrance and for skin nourishing, smoothening of facial lines/wrinkles and providing impetus to immune, nervous, and brain psychological system. The requirement of various attributes for professional clothing like wrinkle-resistance, comfort and self-cleaning of fabric surface have been incorporated in textiles to develop aristocratic, social, religious, business, and ritual party outfit. High value Cosmetotextile and Ayurvastra have also been designed for slimming, moisturising, perfuming, healthy, fresh feeling and curing/healing of many diseases in a holistic approach by taking cue from the traditional knowledge of cosmetics, Ayurveda and clothing science. As these high value textiles are produced mostly from the natural fibres and functionalized using natural products/biomaterials, they can be effectively used for the production of sustainable luxurious textiles. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.

Flame retardancy was imparted to a scoured and bleached, proteinous woollen textile by using banana pseudostem sap, an ecofriendly waste agricultural product, at different pH levels. The flame retardancy characteristics of both the control and the treated fabrics were analysed in terms of the limiting oxygen index and the vertical flammability measurement. Thermal degradation and fire retardancy mechanisms were studied using thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Moreover, the charring mechanism of both the control and the banana-pseudostem-sap-treated fabrics with varying pH was analysed and reported in detail. The wool fabric was also dyed with CI Acid Blue 25 using banana pseudostem sap as well as water as the medium. The fabric dyed with the banana pseudostem sap medium at pH 5.5 showed more colour exhaustion, colour strength, and thermal stability compared with the control wool fabric. The mechanism by which superior fire retardancy and colour strength are imparted to the woollen textile by the application of banana pseudostem sap is proposed. © 2016 Society of Dyers and Colourists.

Banana pseudostem sap (BPS) has been extracted from the outer sheath of pseudostem of banana tree (Musa Cavendish). It looks like colourless clean water immediately after extraction. However, with the passage of time, it slowly turns into a light khaki colour due to the oxidation of phenolic rings present in it. As BPS contains minerals like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, it can be used as an energy booster for the sportsmen or as an energy drink for alike applications. It has been reported that the alkaline fraction of BPS can be used as an anticorrosive agent for concrete steel, as it is composed of compounds like inorganic materials, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phenolic aromatic ring. As far as the textile application is concerned, BPS has been used as an active ingredient for natural dye, mordant, UV protective and flame retardant formulation. Connected with the mordanting action of BPS on the cotton fabric, the 50% BPS (mordant) was combined with the 50% B. micratha (natural dye) for getting a level-deep brown shade on the cotton textile. As far as the UV protection is concerned, the BPS dyed fabric showed an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) value of above 50, which is mainly attributed to the presence of large phenolic compounds in it. Presence of the various metal salts and phosphates in BSP could also improve the thermal stability of the cellulosic, lingo-cellulosic and protein substrates. BPS can also be used for medicinal purpose to reduce blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, skin nourishment and also as an ailment for stings or bites. The present chapter also enlightens us with the recent improvement in fertilizing efficiency during cultivation of onion, spinach and garlic by using BPS as a biofertilizer. BPS can remediate soil and help to increase the yield, nutrient uptake of the leafy vegetables. The present chapter briefly represents the recent glimpse on the valuable textile and non-textile application of BPS in the context of sustainable agriculture, food technology, medicine, cosmetics and textiles. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The flame retardant functionality has been imparted in cellulosic fabric using mixed formulation of banana pseudostem sap (BPS) and boric acid (BA). The extracted sap is mixed with different concentration of BA and applied onto the pre-mordanted bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics at elevated temperature. It is found that BA acts as a strong afterglow and smoke arresting agent, when applied at the concentration of > 2% (w/v). Flame retardant characteristics of both the control and the treated fabrics have been analysed in terms of limiting oxygen index, vertical flammability and temperature generation profile during burning. The (BPS+3% BA) treated cotton fabric sample shows the LOI value of 42 and the specific char length of 14cm after vertical flammability test. The thermal degradation and pyrolysis mechanism are also studied, using both thermogravimetric analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, the charring morphology and mechanism of both the control and the treated fabric is analysed in detail by scanning electron microscopy and FTIR analysis. A char structure model and the mechanism of char formation have also been proposed in the paper. © 2018, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Protective textiles are saving human beings from various adverse environmental conditions like fire, heat, bullets, microorganisms, mosquito bites, etc. In connection with flame-resistant textiles, fish DNA, casein, whey protein, and wastage plantbased bio-macromolecules, such as spinach juice, banana pseudostem sap, coconut shell extract, and so on, are well reported as flame-resistant materials on cellulosic, lignocellulosic, and protein-based textile products. Apart from it, different nanobased metal oxides are also very popular because of their fire-retardant efficacy at low add-on percentage. Recently, bulletproof and the stab-resistant textile materials are also capturing the defense market very quickly. Concerning this area, designing lightweight bulletproof materials is the major target for the researchers for its wide application. As regards mosquito-repellent protective textiles, different synthetic-based products and eco-friendly plant-based oils (like citronella, clove, eucalyptus) are explored by researchers for their efficient mosquito- repellent properties. Besides, to evaluate the efficacy of mosquito repellency, cone tests, cage tests, etc., are also developed by research societies. Wastage plant extracts like coconut shell extract, neem, aloe vera, etc., are reported to have excellent microorganism protective efficacy when it is applied on the fabric surface. © 2018 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Background: Pseudostem is a part of banana plant that looks like trunk which is formed by tightly overlapping leaf sheaths. The main aim of the study is to apply the pseudostem extract on the cotton fabric at varying pH level by pad-dry-cure method and evaluate the comfort properties of the fabric. Materials and Methods: The pseudostem extract was prepared in a grinder. The cotton fabric was treated with banana pseudostem aqueous extract by pad-dry-cure method. The pH of the solution is varied from 6 to 8 by keeping the temperature and time constant. The influence of pH on the comfort properties of the fabric such as air permeability, wickability, and thermal resistivity is studied. Results and Discussion: The fabric treated with pH 6.5 has given better comfort properties. The thermal resistivity of the fabric was improved by 9.24, 7.26, 6.49, and 4.46% than the samples treated with pH 6, 7, 7.5, and 8. No significant influence on fabric wickability and air permeability is found due to change in pH. © 2018 BRNSS Publication Hub. All rights reserved.

Chemical processing of textiles, starting from the preparatory processing to dyeing and finishing, is very important for value addition to them in terms of fashion and function. However, those processes are water, energy and chemical-intensive and more often, the source of serious ecological degradation. Due to the increased global awareness and tougher government legislation to combat environmental pollution in recent years, the demand for natural fibre based textiles dyed with eco-friendly sustainable chemicals/natural dyes as well as finished subsequently with various bio-molecules (both plant and protein based) is gaining academic, research and industrial importance. As a result, dyeing of textiles is being carried out or attempted to carry out using various natural products, like plant and insect-based extracts owing to the presence of inherent coloring compounds in them. More recently, a super-critical dyeing process for the synthetic textiles (especially, the polyester textile) is also getting considerable attention in the sustainability domain of coloration. Since a long time, some of the cottons grown have exhibited attractive natural colors due to the variation of their inherent gene characteristics. Besides, some plant and protein-based bio-molecules reportedly have shown excellent UV protection, antimicrobial, mosquito-repellent, wellbeing and aroma functionality on application to the textiles. Such value-added finishing of textiles have been carried out by using a number of plant extracts, such as neem (antimicrobial), aloe vera (cosmeto-textile), turmeric (antimicrobial), Arjuna (well-being), sandalwood (cosmeto, well-being textile and skin nourishment), Tulasi (antimicrobial), jasmine, and eucalyptus oil (aroma). Cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic textiles being highly flammable in nature, the flame retardancy of such textiles has been improved by using different wastage plant bio-molecules like banana pseudostem sap, green coconut shell extract and such others and also, protein-based bio-molecule (DNA, casein, hydrophobin), nano-based metal oxides and by plasma application of textiles at a suitable atmosphere with polymeric gases like phosphine, etc. All these applications have resulted in production of fire retardant fabrics with minimal add-on of the chemicals, without compromising the quality of the finished textiles. The wash and wear finish of the textiles could be improved by low formaldehyde or zero formaldehyde based resin cross-linkers like di methylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMeDHEU), poly carboxylic acid-based resin like butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA based formulation), natural soya based resin, etc. Recently, enzyme based textile finishing is also gaining significant consideration in the textile industry, particularly in the areas of bio-polishing of cotton, denim washing and fading. Besides, enzyme-based desizing, scouring and bleaching of the cellulosic textiles are also popular in the industry. The enzyme-based processing has helped to reduce the amount of harsh toxic chemicals, which are conventionally used in the preparatory processing of textiles. More recently, various nano-based, eco-friendly insect and moth-proof textiles have also emerged in the market. So far as the sustainability of the textile processing is concerned, different eco-friendly irradiation techniques like plasma and UV exposure of textiles are helping in adopting energy, water and chemical saving dyeing and finishing processes, for example, self-cleaning, soil-release finish, etc. Very recently, bio-mimic textiles like self-cleaning lotus effect, shark skin-effect and nano gecko-feet textiles are also getting attention of the research community. © 2018 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

This research paper is focused on the dyeing of silk fabrics with a natural dye extracted from Celosia flower and banana pseudostem sap as a biomordant. The dyeing process was carried out by three different techniques i.e. pre-, post-, and simultaneous mordanting method. The effect of dyeing process parameters namely mordant concentration, pH, and temperature on the dye absorption and fastness properties of dyed silk fabric have been investigated for each dyeing method. Optimal values of dyeing process parameters have been categorized based on the highest value of dye absorption in terms of K/S value. Optimum mordant concentration was found to be 18 % for all sets of dyeing methods. The optimum pH was examined to be 4.5, 4.0, and 4.0 and dyeing temperature was 70 °C, 70 °C, and 65 °C for the pre-, post-, and simultaneous mordanting dyeing methods, respectively. The color fastness to light, washing, and rubbing of dyed silk fabrics was investigated. Fastness values of light and rubbing showed fair-to-good fastness level, whereas the color fastness to washing was found to be good to very good. The antibacterial activity of the banana sap mordanted and simultaneously dyed silk fabrics was evaluated. The dyed silk fabric exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. © 2020, The Korean Fiber Society.

The present study has demonstrated the flame reatardancy effect of Banana pseudostem (BPS) as plant wastes at different concentrations on bleached and mercerized Egyptian cotton fabric made of Giza 90. Alkaline method was used to produce the extract BPS. The cotton fabric after the treatment was found to produce stable natural semi kaki color. Flame retardant properties of both the untreated and the treated cotton fabrics were analyzed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability. The control and the treated cotton fabrics were performed using FTIR, thermo-gravimetric analysis, mechanical properties, and color components analysis. The results revealed that the treated cotton fabrics were found to have good flame retardant property of LOI at BPS concentration 10% compared to the control fabrics. In the vertical flammability test, the treated fabric showed flame for a few seconds and then got extinguished. In the horizontal flammability test, the treated fabric showed no flame, but was burning with a propagation rate of 7.5 mm/min, which was almost 10 times lower than that noted with the control fabric. The results revealed that there was no significant degradation in mechanical strengths. Based on the results, the mechanisms of formation of natural color on the cotton fabrics using the proposed BPS treatments have been postulated. © 2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

Natural fiber crops are gaining more importance to the human beings with respect to their usefulness. Most of the natural lignocellulosic fibers with their unique properties and versatility deserve to be called the “fibers for the future.” In India, there are many unexplored agro-based lignocellulosic fibers and one among them is the maize husk fiber (Zea mays). Researchers have reported the different process line of extraction of cornhusk fiber from the by-product of corn and reported to have low crystallinity and rough surface with hollow cross-sectional area. Cornhusk fiber shows less tensile strength and more elongation compared to popular lignocellulosic fiber jute and cellulosic cotton. Researchers have reported synthesized process of good quality MCC (microcrystalline cellulose) from extracted cornhusk fiber. It also has been documented that its rheological and other physicochemical properties are comparable with commercial MCC. Few research groups have reported literature on the spinning process of corn fiber and the process line of the production of cotton and cornhusk fiber blended yarn. In addition, some of the groups also have been engaged in the dyeing process of corn fiber with synthetic and natural dyes. Recently, one research group has reported the process of making thermal stable corn fiber as it can be useful for making different end products. Connecting with it, they have proposed new method for making eco-friendly thermal stable corn fiber by using banana pseudostem sap, a widely available agro-waste in Asian countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Banana pseudostems are now recognized as a sustainable raw material with a wide range of applications. Plenty of research attention has been paid to banana pseudostem fiber extraction, characterization, modification, and utilization. Mechanical extraction takes precedence over manual extraction. Surface treatments are employed to modify the surface of a fiber to make it suitable for customized applications. Because of its high cellulose content, good to moderate strength, fineness, fiber length-to-breath ratio, and other properties, banana pseudostem fiber is currently used to make nano and microcrystalline cellulose, activated carbon, green composites, and technical textiles. This review article discusses the manual and mechanical extraction processes of banana fiber, as well as its quality evaluation, morphology, chemical composition, physico-mechanical properties, and various surface modification techniques. © 2023 The Author(s).
