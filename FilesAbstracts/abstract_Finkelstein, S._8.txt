Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Conceptualization and research have addressed the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of top management teams and, independently, the effectiveness of alternative corporate governance structures. Those studies which do concurrently consider directors and management focus largely on the board's monitoring of the CEO. The interdependencies which exist among chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors necessitate an integrative approach which simultaneously considers these groups of strategic leaders. In this paper, we provide a rationale whereby a firm might elect a CEO or board dominance structure as compared to more balanced governance structures. We suggest that the efficacy of such choices may depend on several attendant conditions including the portfolio exposure and globalization of the firm, its ownership patterns (e.g., five percent owners, institutional investors, positions held by other corporations), and resource dependence and information requirements.

We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the post-restructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.

The paper compares the contribution, power and influence of non-executive directors and part-time chairpersons within large UK PLC's, using interview data collected for a pilot study. Two questions are addressed: What contribution, if any, is made by non-executive directors and part-time chairmen? How, if at all, do part-time chairpersons exercise power and influence? The paper reveals that part-time chairmen and non-executive directors claim to contribute to a broad range of issues, ranging from the strategy of the firm, to the appointment, selection and dismissal of board members. Contribution is made by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors converting power sources into influence. A variety of influence methods are used by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors to contribute as board members. Part-time chairmen influence most by assertiveness, using the authority that comes with leading the board. Non-executive directors influence most through persuasion and coalition formation. Non-executive directors less on their positional authority to exert influence, and more on their personal knowledge, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to form relationships with individuals both inside and outside of the boardroom.

This paper examines the factors influencing the relative weights placed on financial and non-financial performance measures in CEO bonus contracts. We find that the use of non-financial measures increases with the level of regulation, the extent to which the firm follows an innovation-oriented strategy, the adoption of strategic quality initiatives, and the noise in financial measures. We find no evidence that the choice of performance measures in bonus contracts is associated with the level of financial distress or the value of CEO equity holdings relative to salary and bonus. Our results also provide no support for the hypothesis that CEOs with greater influence over the board of directors are more likely to be compensated based on non-financial measures.

CEOs who jointly serve as board chairs have been the focus of considerable controversy of late. Powerful organizational constituents including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York City Pension Fund have targeted firms that rely on the joint structure. These shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair. Governance activists have made similar recommendations, most notably in the Cadbury Report, a governance reform document written in the United Kingdom. The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers. Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern. More than 80 percent of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair. They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community. Accordingly, we pose the question: Does board leadership structure matter? Specifically, we focus on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts. Our analysis leads us to conclude while there may, at times, be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions (e.g., financial distress; weak board of directors), to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort.

Tracing backward the career paths of the key executives of Business Week's 1990 listing of the 1000 most valuable publicly held companies, we empirically examined the impact of announced changes in key executive plurality on stockholder returns. We found the more complete the position consolidation, the more negative were the shareholder responses. To attempt to gain further understanding, the additional variables of executive's origin, the size of the board of directors of the firm, the proportion of outsiders on the board, and prior firm performance were examined.

The new human resources (HR) function represents a move away from an administrative, reactionary role towards a more strategic, proactive, planning position. The current research surveyed members of the Australian Human Resource Institute to determine, first, whether these changes are actually taking place in Australia and, second, to provide a profile of those involved in the area in order to analyse how well the function is equipped to deal with this period of transition. Results show that change is apparent. Departments are now called 'human resource' departments rather than 'personnel', and the HR function enjoys improved status. Representation on boards of directors is poor but there is evidence of committees of senior executives meeting regularly to discuss HR matters. Responses also suggest balanced involvement of line managers in HR initiatives. Change is also evident in the profile of those involved in the HR area. Gender equity has been achieved and the group is more highly qualified than it was in 1985. Areas of concern include reduced salary levels, the non-representation of women in the higher salary group, careful monitoring of younger people to ensure that they get access to a broad range of business experiences within the organization, and retention of those involved in the HR area who understand the culture and strategic vision of the firm.

Many corporate governance observers agree that when firms encounter dramatically changed competitive environments, the board of directors may become involved in the strategy formation process. Based on Finkelstein and Hambrick's (Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D., 1996. Strategic leadership: top executives and their effects on organizations. West, Minneapolis, MN.) conceptual model, we examine the effects of the board of directors and executive committee characteristics on the degree of internationalization of the U.S. telecommunications industry during the 12 years after AT&T's 1984 divestiture. We also examine the effects of the regulatory environment and core business growth on the degree on internationalization during this time. We find support linking executive committee characteristics and regulatory environment to the degree of internationalization. Characteristics of the entire board are consistently found to be insignificant. (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

Incentive or performance contingent compensation plans are rapidly becoming the norm in corporate America, as boards of directors attempt to make executives more accountable to shareholders. However, incentive plans also expose executives to risk, and may also impart a short-term bias on their decision-making processes. This article suggests that the tension between the pressures for accountability and long-term decision making can be managed by aligning firm strategy with an incentive plan that is based on an appropriate performance criteria.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.

Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.

An examination of 165 top management successions in U.S. firms during 1989-91 reveals that external successions are more likely in small firms, in firms with poor economic performance, and in firms which offer the successor several top positions (for example, Chairman and CEO). This last finding illustrates that successor's interests and demands (such as organizational power) are also important in determining the final match between manager and firm. We also find that, on average, the postsuccession performance of external successors is superior to that of internal successors. This could indicate that the Board of Directors faces an agency problem, leading it to appoint too often from inside.

The primary aim of this paper is to explore the relevance and applicability of leadership research in enhancing our understanding of boards of directors' functioning and effectiveness. Secondly, to discuss methodological issues with respect to board research and indicate potentially fruitful methodological approaches. It is suggested that the leadership research stream focused on traits and competencies is particularly promising for future research on boards, since it has been demonstrated that there are traits that can distinguish leaders from non-leaders or effective leaders from ineffective ones; as well as that certain competencies can distinguish superior performers from average performers in particular jobs. Moreover, it is proposed that a promising way forward in terms of methodology is to focus on gathering in-depth qualitative longitudinal data of actual board behaviours based on observation, and to inform quantitative research by such in-depth data in order to enhance the operationalisation of theoretical variables, as well as identifying the critical variables in the first place.

Most current work on Boards of Directors has been focused on what can be considered best practices for effective governance in terms of roles, composition, process and style. Furthermore, this literature can be divided among very practically oriented managerial work, and more rigorous, theoretically based work. Most of the empirical research in this area has been centered on Anglo-Saxon countries. Some European countries, like Spain, have a very different governance tradition. Given this context, our present work deals with two complementary objectives: 1. To ascertain the current status of governance practices in Spain. 2. To obtain evidence about which of these practices may be associated with effective governance.

This study describes the survival cases of two local savings banks in Finland during fundamental changes in 1990's when 90% of the Finnish Savings Bank Group did not survive. Survival is studied through the roles of the non-executive boards and the CEOs in the context of three change periods. Institutional theory is used as a framework in describing and explaining the survival. The cases describe how radical renewals can be made despite dominant actors and generally agreed ways of change in the field. It is suggested that the CEO and the non-executive board of directors were in a key role in changing the future of a local savings bank. Old institutions can die, but the active role of the small banks themselves was decisive; by taking active role they recreated and renewed their organizations (c.f. Greenwood and Hinings 1996).

The coefficient of variation (V) is a statistical measure commonly used for comparing diversity in work groups. It has been employed by organizational researchers to index the relative internal variability of top-management teams, task groups, boards of directors, departments, and other social aggregates on numerous dimensions. Commenting on its widespread application, this article reviews cautions and pitfalls associated with its use for this purpose. Research implications associated with using V are also discussed.

This paper builds a model of the effects of agency risk and procedural justice in the boards of directors of venture capital-backed firms. Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

This study investigates the influence of growth potential on corporate governance mechanisms. Results suggest that firms with high growth potential make greater use of managerial equity ownership and long term incentives and have higher proportions of insiders on their boards of directors. The findings are congruent with the argument that firms with high growth potential make use of more flexible, future-oriented mechanisms of corporate governance.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors are coming under increasing scrutiny, both in the wake of a number of serious corporate frauds and failures and through a more general debate about the nature of corporate governance and its role in achieving national competitiveness. Though research on boards is growing, there remains a lack of empirical studies on the perceptions of directors themselves as to their role and influence in the running of organizations, and in particular the strategic process. This article responds to widespread calls for direct study of boards of directors by using a multi-method approach involving an in-depth examination of 51 directors of UK public companies, a survey of 121 company secretaries and four case studies of UK plcs, where multiple board members were interviewed. Through the use of a grounded methodology, this article examines the impact of boards on strategy and shows that by establishing the business definition, gatekeeping, selecting directors, and confidence building, the board influences the boundaries of strategic action. Evidence for the managerial domination of boards was slight, but the results showed support for a number of theoretical frameworks, suggesting that multiple perspectives are required to fully understand the nature of board activity.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

The empirical relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, the investment opportunity set (IOS) and corporate governance mechanisms is analyzed for a sample of 415 Canadian firms in 1997. Results indicate that firms with high IOS pay higher levels of total compensation to their CEOs. In addition, CEOs of high IOS derive a larger proportion of their compensation from performance-contingent forms of pay such as bonuses, stock option grants and long-term incentive plans. However, CEOs with weak boards of directors are compensated more than CEOs with powerful boards. Contrary to our expectation, we find that in high IOS firms with weak boards of directors, CEOs seek to have higher proportions of contingent forms of pay in their compensation. An implication of this result is that contingent compensation practices may be a more value-enhancing form of remuneration for CEOs. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Twelve nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) within a major urban center in the northeastern portion of the USA served as our sample. CEOs responded to a questionnaire and were interviewed to collect personal and organizational data. Findings included that most of the organizations did not have succession plans; boards of directors, not incumbent CEOs, appointed successors, except in the case of founders; and despite the fact that insiders are provided with leadership training, they are often not promoted to the position of CEO. Implication for leadership and organization development and recommendations for future research are made. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.

We examine, both theoretically and empirically, top-management compensation in the presence of agency conflicts when shareholders have delegated governance responsibilities to a self-interested Board of Directors (BOD). We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.

A matched sample methodology was utilized to detect ownership and management differences between first generation and multi-generation independent unquoted family companies in the UK. Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in first generation and multi-generation companies were generally drawn from the family owning the company. Both types of companies also had small management teams. Several statistically significant differences were detected. CEOs served longer apprenticeships in multi-generation rather than first generation companies. Multi-generation rather than first generation companies were more likely to employ managers drawn from the family owning the company. In other respects, multi-generation companies generally appeared to be better managed than first generation companies. Multi-generation companies had larger boards of directors. Moreover, a larger proportion of multi-generation rather than first generation companies employed a non-executive director. Owners of both types of family companies, but particularly the owners of first generation companies may be 'control averse'. Many first generation companies (and some multi-generation companies) associated with a shallower managerial pool had failed to address this potential managerial and strategic weakness by selective use of 'outside' managerial expertise. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.

This article examines the compensation of top managers of nonprofits in the United States using panel data from tax returns of the organizations from 1992 to 1996. Studying managers in nonprofits is particularly interesting given the difficulty in measuring performance. The article examines many areas commonly studied in the executive pay (within for-profit firms) literature. It explores pay differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms, pay variability within and across nonprofit industries, managerial pay and performance (including organization size and fund raising) in nonprofits, the effect of government grants on managerial pay, and the relationship between boards of directors and managerial pay in nonprofits.

We study the long-term stock performance of initial public offerings (IPOs). We examine how past performance affects the board of directors' stability and how changes in boards affect subsequent performance. We introduce a dynamic, scale invariant stability metric to measure such changes. Our results indicate that among IPO firms, those with poorer initial performance experience greater board instability and that greater board stability is associated with improvement in subsequent performance. These results indicate that board members leave poorly performing firms, rather than shareholders replacing ineffective boards. Retaining boards that experience initial good performance is associated with continued success.

Although scholars have studied outside executive succession for decades, there is still no clear definition of the term "outsider". We focus on a new dimension of outsiderness, the industrial background of executives hired from outside the firm into a CEO position. This paper examines the antecedents of boards' decisions on the industry origin of outside successors as well as the short-term stock market response. We find that firms with more independent boards and with blockholders owning large amounts of stock are more likely to hire industry unrelated successors. However, the board's decision does not strictly follow the rhetoric of stockholder's interests. The stock market reacts more positively to outside CEO succession announcements when the CEO comes from an industry related firm. These findings support our theoretical arguments that the boards of directors may use a logic or rule of appropriateness in deciding the industrial origin of outside successors.

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

This study examines the relationship between demographic diversity on boards of directors with firm financial performance. This relationship is examined using 1993 and 1998 financial performance data (return on asset and investment) and the percentage of women and minorities on boards of directors for 127 large US companies. Correlation and regression analyses indicate board diversity is positively associated with these financial indicators of firm performance. Implications for both strategic human resource management and future research are discussed.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

White-collar crime can cost a company from 1 percent to 6 percent of annual sales, yet little is known about the organizational conditions that can reduce this cost. Previous governance research has examined the link between block holders, boards of directors, or CEO compensation and fraud. In this study, these traditional measures of governance are found to have little impact. Instead, operational governance, including clarity of policies and procedures, formal cross-company communication, and performance-based pay for the board and for more employees, significantly reduces the likelihood of a crime commission.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors and their monitoring committees (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the full board and its monitoring committees, and a greater proportion of independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the full board. Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on full board and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that full board independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture. (c) 2003 Wiley. All rights reserved.

The control role of the Board of Directors is aimed at monitoring the decisions and actions undertaken by managers in order to protect stockholders' interests. Considerable theoretical and empirical research has analyzed whether directors' behavior is consistent with their fiduciary responsibility, but this research has reported inconsistent findings. This paper offers a comprehensive review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the control role of the board and suggests several guidelines for future research. (c) 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

This study examines the relationship between top management team duality and the decision to release false financial information. Using a matched sample of 103 firms that were convicted of issuing fraudulent financial statements in the period from 1992 to 1996, the results show that this form of illegal corporate behavior is more likely to occur when there is a concentration of power in the hands of insiders. For these firms, insiders control the top management team and the Board of Directors by simultaneously occupying the key managerial positions of clout within the firm while also sitting on the Board (duality), and through their ownership interest in the firm.

Regulators argue that mandated compensation disclosure improves corporate governance by permitting shareholders to enjoin boards of directors to reward executives in ways that are consistent with shareholder value creation. We posit that mandated compensation disclosure, or the absence thereof, has a greater impact on the CEO compensation practices of widely held firms than of closely held firms. More specifically, we expect that, in the absence of mandated disclosure, CEO compensation is likely to be less performance-contingent among widely held firms than among closely held firms. Moreover, we also expect that the advent of mandated disclosure leads widely held firms to increase the extent to which CEO compensation is performance-contingent, much more so than closely held firms would. We use a unique data base resulting from the Ontario Securities Commission amendment of regulation 638 in October 1993. For the first time, this amendment required firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange to provide detailed executive compensation data similar to those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the current year as well as retroactively for the previous two years. We find that, in the absence of mandated disclosure, CEO cash compensation in widely held firms is less performance-contingent than in closely held firms. With the imposition of mandated disclosure, performance-contingent cash compensation increases more in widely held firms than in closely held firms. Results with respect to stock option grants are mixed, with both closely held and widely held firms reacting to the advent of mandated disclosure.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

The size, characteristics and structure of boards of directors have been claimed to be an important influence on the performance of large firms, but have been less examined in small firms. For larger firms the role of boards acts more as a substitute for the development of internal staff and management skills, indicating that for large firms directors chiefly support the control role of CEOs. The importance of seeing boards, external consultants and internal management skills as substitutes is demonstrated, and is shown to have a non-linear relation with firm size. However, a key finding of the paper is that there is little evidence of a strong association of board size, board qualifications, or board structure with firm performance, measured by profitability, employment growth or propensity to innovate.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

The board of directors is the cornerstone of any effective corporate governance system. A well- structured board can effectively monitor and motivate management of a company for the benefit of the company's shareholders. This paper investigates the relationship between board structure and firm performance using a sample of 490 publicly listed firms in China. The characteristics of board structure we examined include: board size, inside/outside/independent directors, CEO/Chair duality, stock holdings of directors, rewards to directors and aged directors. We find significant relationship between firm performance and three characteristics: the rewards to director, the stock holdings of directors and the existence of independent directors. We also find political influences on the effectiveness of boards. When state ownership is more than 50% (state-dominating), rewards and stock holdings of directors are useful. When state ownership is less than 50% (non-state-dominating), the existence of independent directors comes into effect. In addition, our analyses indicate that state ownership affects firm performance. State ownership is positively related to firm performance in state-dominating groups while negatively related to firm performance in non-state-ownership groups.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

We develop theoretical arguments from the efficiency wage model (Shapiro & Stiglitz, 1984) to provide better understanding of Fama's (1980) seminal notion that executive labor markets contribute to the alignment of executive and shareholder interests. We show how the efficiency wage model can be integrated with several other theories of executive turnover. Furthermore, the model allows for predictions that have received very little analysis to date, such as the effect of firm risk and executive salaries on turnover. We test predictions from the model on a sample of executives from 280 manufacturing firms observed annually from 1986 to 1992. Our sample includes data on over 12,000 observations and nearly 1,700 employment terminations. The results are consistent with the main predictions of the efficiency wage model. Holding performance constant, boards of directors are less patient with (more likely to dismiss) executives who have lower salaries and those in higher risk firms. (c) 2004 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This study empirically examines the association between certain director characteristics and the extent of voluntary audit committee disclosure in annual reports. Results suggest that Singapore's publicly traded firms are more likely to voluntarily disclose audit committee related information as: the number of board members increases different individuals occupy the roles of CEO and board chairperson the proportion of independent directors serving on the board increases. Findings, however, fail to show any association between the amount of voluntary audit committee disclosure and the percentage of executive directors' ownership. Documented findings are of interest and benefit to various parties including regulators, corporate governance reformists, and corporate management. For instance, findings imply that a positive by-product of implementing major corporate governance reforms currently championed by corporate governance reformists will be an increase in audit committee disclosures. As a result, there will be less pressure on regulators to develop, introduce, and enforce mandatory audit committee disclosures that may be potentially intrusive to a firm's management.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the effects of board of directors' network characteristics on firm performance using a sample of 199 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1990 through 1999. Two board network characteristics are discussed, namely: board network density and board external social capital. Board network density is defined as the extensiveness or the cohesiveness of contact among the members of board of directors, and board external social capital refers to the degree to which board members have outside contacts in the external environment. The test results suggest that a moderate level of board network density enhances firm value, while too cohesive a board network destroys it. It is also found that board members' elite school networks were positively associated with firm performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

There has been a considerable literature on the determinants of why firms undertake foreign direct investment (FDI), but very little on whether firms with different governance characteristics are more or less likely to venture overseas. For example, are family-controlled firms more predisposed to FDI than firms, with similar attributes, but different forms of ownership? Does the presence of institutional shareholders suggest a greater propensity to invest abroad? Does the composition of the Board of Directors have an impact? Most extant studies of corporate governance focus on the impact of governance factors on firm performance. However, these performance outcomes are a function of the strategic decisions made by the firms, which suggests it might be useful to consider the relationship between corporate governance factors and particular strategic decisions. One example is the decision to undertake foreign direct investment. The two main strands of IB literature on the determinants of FDI have little or nothing to say about how corporate governance factors might affect the FDI decision. Both internalisation theory and the resource-based view see FDI primarily as a means by which firms can appropriate rents in overseas markets from the exploitation of their idiosyncratic resources and capabilities. This paper extends this literature by investigating the effects of governance factors on the decision to undertake FDI. In particular, we want to assess the impact upon the FDI decision of (a) the extent of family control, (b) the presence of domestic and foreign institutional shareholders, and (c) the composition of the Board of Directors. We investigate these effects using a sample of 228 publicly listed firms in Taiwan, and our results clearly indicate that family control and share ownership by domestic financial institutions in Taiwanese firms are associated with the decision to undertake FDI. We also find that corporate governance impacts in different ways with regard to Taiwanese FDI in China in comparison to Taiwanese FDI in the rest of the world. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are important engines to stimulate the economic growth of a country. The survival of these firms is partly dependent on their human capital availability. Using strategic leadership theory, this paper examines the characteristics of the entrepreneur/manager, the top management team and the board of directors in Dutch SMEs. Empirical data identifies the entrepreneurs/managers as the most important decision makers. However, to support their decision-making process in the current competitive business environment, two thirds of the CEOs have created top management teams. CEOs and top management team executives combine their industry and functional knowledge to create the necessary firm know-how. Less than half of the firms have adopted a supervisory board. A reason for this could be the CEO's limited knowledge on the concept of governance. The paper concludes that entrepreneurs/managers of SMEs should be made aware of the strategic knowledge and networking advantages both top-management team and supervisory board members can offer.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

The board of directors is generally seen as an important internal governance structure. However, the empirical evidence on the board-performance relationship is not conclusive. On the other hand, a growing literature suggests that different control mechanisms, either internal or external to the firm, can interact with each other and affect performance. One such important factor is product market competition. The objective of the study is to investigate further the board-performance relationship taking into consideration the potential effect of market competition. More precisely, the study analyzes the combined effect of boards of directors' characteristics, and market discipline on firm performance. Overall, the results suggest that, competition has a positive and significant impact on firm profitability and productivity. Moreover, this determinant factor creates the conditions for which the board-performance relationship is supported. In other words, for boards to be effective, firms should be exposed to a competitive environment. (c) Blackwcll Publishing Ltd. 2005.

Past literature in board research has centred on board structure and company performance. Over the years, empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between these two variables (Dalton and Daily, 1999. Across the Board, March, 28-32). Until recently, the literature on board processes has been sparse. The reason for insufficient empirical work on board processes possibly is due to the difficulty of gaining access to boards. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model and tested the model on publicly listed companies in Singapore. Based on a sample of 212 company responses and 299 directors, we conclude that board structure does not affect board process while board process is related to board performance. In terms of individual parameters, effort norms, cognitive conflict and the presence and usage of skills are positively related to board roles and board transparency. Also, affective and process conflicts are negatively related to board roles and board transparency. Finally, board process does not mediate the relationship between board structure and board performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Empirical literature on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different studies in the Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration and the board of directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of managerial controls, in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.

The Canadian Securities Administrators' National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Policy"),1 released 15 April 2005, on which the author provided detailed advice, reads that: "[t]he board should develop clear position descriptions for the chair and the chair of each board committee" (section 3.5); the board should engage in an explicit two-step "competencies and skills" recruitment of individual directors (sections 3.12 and 3.14);2 and individual directors should be regularly assessed and that these assessments should consider "the applicable position description(s), as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is expected to bring to the board" (section 3.18). The Canadian Securities Administrators, subject to receiving the required approvals, intend for the Policy to come into force in Canadian jurisdictions on 30 June 2005.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

Embedded within firms are unique stores of intangible human assets that likely influence the way firms compete. We argue that the human and social capital of a firm, particularly at the upper echelon and board of director (BOD) levels, contribute to the firm's awareness of the competitive environment and its motivation and ability to undertake numerous, complex, and forceful competitive actions. We also suggest that the firm's executive compensation systems moderate the effects of these intangible human assets on firm competitive behavior. By examining how human capital, intra-firm social capital, and executive compensation influence firm competitive behavior, we advance a strategic HRM perspective of firm competitive behavior and outline several implications for future research.

This article focuses attention on executive level leadership. It identifies the central issues involved in the study of leadership at this level. It also constructs an agenda for future research for this echelon. Despite the massive growth in activity directed towards leadership development, little of this has been directed at the top level; instead most activity has been focused on junior and middle levels of organizational leadership. A distinction is drawn between 'leadership in organizations' and 'leadership of organizations'. The former can be taken to refer to team leadership and the latter to overall leadership, which includes responsibility for setting the mission and designing the architecture of the organization. This article does not deny the importance of continued research in the former area, but it does argue that more attention needs to be directed towards the study of 'organizational leadership' - denoting in this usage executive leadership or strategy-level leadership. The central quest thus becomes to identify the critical issues which relate specifically or especially to leadership at this level. Three key interrelated themes are identified: structural/relational issues; functional issues; and legitimacy issues. (c) 2005, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors in the Tunisian context. We model the composition of the board of directors as a function of alternative governance mechanisms, some board characteristics and other control variables. On a sample of 97 Tunisian firms, we find evidence that the proportion of outsiders on the board of directors is positively associated with large block, institutional and overseas ownerships, and board size. We document that the CEO duality is associated with a decrease in the board independence. We fail to find an evidence that increased debt ratio to total assets is inversely associated with the outside board representation. While we predict a positive relationship between the board independence and the firm size, the organizational complexity and the quotation status; our results generally do not support this conjecture.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This study, which examines the association between board monitoring and the level of voluntary disclosure, finds new evidence that firms with a higher proportion of independent directors on the board are associated with higher levels of voluntary disclosure. Although board size and CEO duality are not associated with voluntary disclosure, boards with a majority of independent directors have significantly higher levels of voluntary disclosure than firms with balanced boards. Notably, we find that the presence of an external governance mechanism, the regulatory environment, enhances the strength of the association between the proportion of independent directors and the level of voluntary disclosure. This association is some two to three times greater under a "disclosure-based" regulatory regime than under a "merit-based" regulatory regime. (c) 2006 University of Illinois.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempts to find a relationship between boards of directors and firm performance. This paper critically examines the premise on which this research is based. An expectations gap approach is applied for the first time to implicit expectations which assume a relationship between firm performance and company boards. An expectations gap has two elements: a reasonableness gap and a performance gap. Seven aspects of boards are identified as leading to a reasonableness gap. Five aspects of boards are identified as leading to a performance gap. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for empirically testing some of the concepts discussed in this paper.

Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking "strategy consistency" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - There has been increasing interest in Australia regarding corporate boards, their role and the contribution they make to organisations' performance and success. There is however, a gap in our knowledge about what board members do. To better understand boards, we need to know more about the behaviour of those who sit on boards. Many chairmen and all non-executive directors serve on corporate boards in a part-time capacity, however, such part-time service does not negate a role in strategy. The purpose of this paper is to ask how, if at all, do part-time board members influence strategy in Australian public companies? Design/methodology/approach - This paper first examines the literature on choice, change and control as key aspects of firms' strategic conduct. Second, attention turns to generating empirical data to examine how part-time board members engage with these processes. Attention is given to the actions of part-time board members vis-a-vis executive directors, both inside and outside the boardroom. Data from interviews with 20 board members are interpreted using the 1999 framework of McNulty and Pettigrew which conceptualises part-time board members' involvement in strategy as: "taking strategic decisions", "shaping strategic decisions" and "shaping the content, context and conduct of strategy". Findings - Each of the three levels of part-time board member involvement in strategy described by McNulty and Pettigrew engage part-time board members in processes of choice, change and control in differing ways. Part-time board members are able to shape both the ideas that form the content of corporations' strategies and the methodologies and processes by which those ideas evolve. In so doing, part-time board members are capable of exerting control over management and influencing processes of strategic choice and change. Boards of directors have a role in strategy formulation, strategic decision-making and strategic control. Practical implications - The board's role is in the driver's seat not as a rubber stamp. A process whereby board members can engage and exert a controlling influence over strategic direction and outcomes of the corporation is of benefit not only to Australian corporations but has global corporate benefit. Originality/value - This paper describes and analyzes the contribution to strategy made by board members in five Australian companies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The paper aims to examine the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in China. Design/methodology/approach - Using an OLS-regression model to test the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and the level of voluntary disclosure. The sample is based on 559 firm observations in 2002. Findings - Higher blockholder ownership and foreign listing/shares ownership is associated with increased disclosure. However, managerial ownership, state ownership, and legal-person ownership are not related to disclosure. An increase in independent directors increases corporate disclosure and CEO duality is associated with lower disclosure. The paper also finds that larger firms had greater disclosure, while firms with growth opportunities are reluctant to disclose information voluntarily. Research limitations/implications - Firstly, the sample iscomprised of companies listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2002 and only 45.7 percent of representative firms listed in China. Secondly, the disclosure checklist does not cover all voluntary disclosure in corporations as employed and supported in several prior studies. Thirdly, the award of checklist items may be subjected to errors. Practical implications - This paper indicates the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and corporate voluntary disclosure, and provides evidence for Chinese regulators to improve corporate governance and optimize ownership structure. Originality/value - Distinct from prior empirical research based on disclosure behavior in developed-western markets, this study examines the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in the Asian setting of China.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

Recent US corporate governance reforms introduced extensive regulations and guidelines for public corporations, particularly corporate boards. This article evaluates the extent to which empirical research on corporate boards and firm performance supports these reforms. Building on the meta-analysis conducted by Zahra and Pearce (1989), we review 105 studies published between 1989 and 2005. We find most of the practices mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the regulations issued by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, had not been subject to prior study. Where board characteristics have been studied, we find limited guidance for policymakers on identifying governance practices that result in more effective firm performance. In an effort to increase the relevance of future research on boards and firm performance, we provide a framework on corporate boards. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Research suggests that a strong and vigilant board can have a significant influence on the value-creating potential of medium-size companies. Yet, how best to conceptualize this relationship remains controversial.The mainstream approach has been to argue for a direct relationship between board demography and company performance. In opposition stands a growing number of scholars who argue that boards' ability to perform board tasks effectively - their actual behaviour - should be taken into account. Empirical studies comparing the two approaches are however surprisingly scarce. Based on this observation, the aim of the study is to test the influence of boards of directors on CEOs' commitment to take an entrepreneurial posture. Both demographic and behavioural board measures are included in the model. Statistical analysis on a sample of 175 medium-size manufacturing companies gives ample support for the behavioural approach. The study ends with a discussion of the results and suggestions for further research. (c) SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.

This paper examines the factors that affect the activity of the audit committees in Spain. The data used in the analyses are collected from the Spanish stock market in 2003. The results show the existence of a non-linear relationship between the managerial stock ownership and the activity of the audit committee. We have also verified the existence of a lower audit committee's activity in highly leveraged firms and when the ownership structure is concentrated in the hands of large shareholders. The large firms have more active committees than small firms. Finally, we have not found any evidence of a significant influence of the composition of the board or the audit committee on the activity of the latter. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

Decisions by boards of directors can have a critical impact on the success or failure of a firm. These decisions range from the hiring and firing of a CEO to market entry and exit to the way in which a firm reports accounting profits and losses. In seeking to understand boards of directors more fully, we have come to think that we need a more complete picture of intraboard relationships among directors, including but not limited to relationships with the CEO, because these relationships affect critical decisions for the firm. The authors propose that the study of boards of directors could benefit by using a conceptual lens that scholars have yet to apply to this setting-that of the board as a social network unto itself.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the independence of audit committees is affected by the degree of control exerted by managers over the board of directors. Results from a sample of 75 listed Spanish companies show that the majority of firms that voluntarily adopted an audit committee between 1998 and 2001, made an effort to guarantee their independence from management. The degree of independence is shown to be determined by the proportion of inside directors on the board, the same person holding both the CEO and board chairperson positions, and the level of management ownership. These findings may have political implications because existing regulations do not limit the presence of inside directors on audit committees. The presence of inside directors may compromise effectiveness, turning audit committees into instruments of management to provide the appearance of monitoring.

Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the gender composition and structure of the board of directors in not-for-profit organisations and their relation to firm-level entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey sent to Swedish riding schools. The paper focuses on not-for-profit associations and the analysis is based on 60 respondents. The data were analysed by multivariate methods. Findings The overall gender composition of boards had no influence on firm-level entrepreneurship. However, a high proportion of women in powerful positions were found to have a positive influence on one of the study's two dimensions of firm-level entrepreneurship, i.e. strategic opportunism. No influence concerning gender in powerful positions was found on risk taking, the other dimension of firm-level entrepreneurship. Originality/value The attention to gender composition not only focuses on the board at large, but also highlights the specific positions of the chairperson, secretary and treasurer in the board structure. Another valuable insight concerns firm-level entrepreneurship, here treated as a two-dimensional concept, consisting of strategic opportunism and risk taking, which finds support in the analysis. Further, the empirical data were collected from an industry that includes a high proportion of women on the boards, i.e. the Swedish riding school industry. The study contributes to the debate concerning the gender composition on the board of directors where a high proportion of women in powerful positions is positively related with strategic opportunism.

Although the Combined Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, 2006) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of PLC board members, current academic literature offers little guidance to FTSE 250 boards - many of whom are managing different Issues compared with their FTSE 100 counterparts including high corporate growth, existing founder and/or family board members, and/or newly formed boards - on ways In which they can improve the quality of decision-making, increase individual board contribution, and enhance overall board performance and effectiveness. This paper attempts to outline the key issues faced by board members, particularly non-executive directors, serving on FTSE 250 company boards with regard to three distinct roles-strategy, succession planning and risk management - and examines the relevant influences on board members derived from corporate lifecycle, board structure, existing process and board culture which affect board performance and standards of corporate governance. Its conclusions draw on the author's previous research on non-executive contribution (Long, 2004) and her recent experience of reviewing performance and effectiveness of FTSE 100 and 250 boards of directors through Boardroom Review.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

This chapter describes how to use popular software programs (Hierarchical Linear Modeling, LISREL) to analyze multiwave panel data. We review prevailing methods for panel data analyzes in strategic management research and identify their limitations. Then, we explain how multilevel and latent growth modeling provide more rigorous methodologies for studying dynamic phenomena. We present an example illustrating how firm performance can initiate temporal change in the human and social capital of members of Board of Directors, using hierarchical linear modeling. With the same data set, we replicate this test with first-order factor latent growth modeling (LGM). Next, we explain how to use second-order factor LGM with panel data on employee cognitions. Finally, we review the relative advantages and disadvantages of these new data-analytical approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent corporate scandals have put company boards in the spotlight. Legislation, codes of conduct, and guidelines have been developed to improve corporate governance. But while many prescriptions for improving corporate governance focus on the structure of boards, Dr. Richard Leblanc's research suggests that there is no direct causal relationship between board structure and corporate performance. Indeed, many recent failed corporations had exemplary board structure. Richard Leblanc discusses how to assess board effectiveness and improve it. Copyright (c) 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study provides empirical evidence that firms with larger boards have lower variability of corporate performance. The results indicate that board size is negatively associated with the variability of monthly stock returns, annual accounting return on assets, Tobin's Q, accounting accruals, extraordinary items, analyst forecast inaccuracy, and R&D spending, the level of R&D expenditures, and the frequency of acquisition and restructuring activities. The results are consistent with the view that it takes more compromises for a larger board to reach consensus, and consequently, decisions of larger boards are less extreme, leading to less variable corporate performance.

Agency-based studies of boards of directors address factors relevant to board vigilance with respect to the monitoring of senior managers. We argue that relying solely on director vigilance may be limiting because vigilance without relevant experience is unlikely to ensure board effectiveness. Our contention is that boards comprising vigilant directors, as well as directors with appropriate knowledge gained through experience, not only will be better monitors, but also more useful advisors to top managers. The focus of our study is on the effect on acquisition outcomes of the interaction of board vigilance and director experiential learning. Consistent with our expectations, the empirical findings indicate that vigilant boards rich in appropriate experience are associated with superior acquisition outcomes.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Why are some newly appointed CEOs (i.e., those with tenure of three years or less) dismissed while others are not? Drawing upon previous reseach on information asymmetry and adverse selection in CEO selection, I argue that the board of directors may make a poor selection at the time of CEO succession, and as a result, must dismiss the appointee after succession when better information about him/her is obtained. Therefore, the level of information asymmetry at the time of succession increases the likelihood of dismissal. With data on 204 newly appointed CEOs, the results of this study support this argument. After controlling for alternative explanations of CEO dismissal (e.g., firm performance and political factors), the results show that the likelihood of dismissal of newly appointed CEOs is higher in outside successions and/or if the succession follows the dismissal of the preceding CEO. Further, if at the time of succession, the firm's board has a nominating committee that is independent and/or on which outside directors have few external directorships, the likelihood of dismissal is lower. Contributions to the CEO dismissal/succession literature are discussed. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between the compensation of the top five executives at a set of over 400 publicly listed Canadian firms and various internal and external corporate governance-related factors. The media is full of stories suggesting a relationship between large executive compensation packages and failures in governance at various levels within organisations, but there exists little formal analysis of many of these relationships. Our analysis provides empirical evidence supporting some of these assertions, refuting others and documenting new relationships. We find that variances in internal governance related to differences across firms in the characteristics of the CEO, compensation committee and board of directors do influence both the level and composition of executive compensation, especially for the CEO. Considering external measures of corporate governance, we find that different types of shareholders and competitive environments impact executive compensation. We do not find that either the internal or external governance characteristics dominate. (c) 2008 The Author.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This study seeks to provide valuable new insight into the timeliness of corporate internet reporting (TCIR) by a sample of Irish-listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply an updated version of Abdelsalam et al. TCIR index to assess the timeliness of corporate internet reporting. The index encompasses 13 criteria that are used to measure the TCIR for a sample of Irish-listed companies. In addition, the authors assess the timeliness of posting companies' annual and interim reports to their web sites. Furthermore, the study examines the influence of board independence and ownership structure on the TCIR behaviour. Board composition is measured by the percentage of independent directors, chairman's dual role and average tenure of directors. Ownership structure is represented by managerial ownership and blockholder ownership. Findings - It is found that Irish-listed companies, on average, satisfy only 46 per cent of the timeliness criteria assessed by the timeliness index. After controlling for size, audit fees and firm performance, evidence that TCIR is positively associated with board of director's independence and chief executive officer (CEO) ownership is provided. Furthermore, it is found that large companies are faster in posting their annual reports to their web sites. The findings suggest that board composition and ownership structure influence a firm's TCIR behaviour, presumably in response to the information asymmetry between management and investors and the resulting agency costs. Practical implications - The findings highlight the need for improvement in TCIR by Irish-listed companies in many areas, especially in regard to the regular updates of information provided on their web sites. Originality/value - This study represents one of the first comprehensive examinations of the important dimension of the TCIR in Irish-listed companies. (c) 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the views of directors of public-listed Australian companies regarding the role of the independent director and the significance of that role in relationship to the composition of the board of company directors. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study using a grounded research approach was used and 30 directors of Australian public-listed companies were interviewed. Findings - The analysis indicates that participating directors were convinced that a majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) provided a safeguard for a balance of power in the board/management relationship. The difference between NEDs, who are also independent directors, and NEDs who are not independent, was highlighted as an important distinction. The capacity for board members to think independently was seen to be enhanced, but not necessarily ensured, with majority membership of NEDs. However, a majority of independent minds expressing multiple points of view was perceived to reduce the board room hazard of "group think." Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted within the context of the preferred model for board composition in Australian public-listed companies which requires a majority of NEDs. Originality/value - Conflicting evidence surrounding the claim that a majority of independent members in the board structure contributes to "best pratice governance" makes the paper relevant to governance issues being debated in the global arena.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Purpose - Past literature on board research has centred on board structure and firm performance. Since empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between the two, attention has shifted towards board role performance. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper examines three conceptual models for the studying of board role performance: structure, process, and mediation. Findings - Current literature provides little consensus as to the specific configuration for effective board role performance. Originality/value - First, the study examines various aspects of board role performance. This is in contrast with previous research which largely investigates board role performance in general or under the dominant agency perspective which emphasises the board's monitoring role. Second, unlike traditional governance models, the role of board process is explicitly advocated here. Third, the three conceptual models regarding the relationship among board structure, process and performance give an alternative avenue for researchers to explain inconsistencies in past board research. They complement the growing interest in opening up the "black-box" of decision making that has been manifested in studies involving top management teams. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

This paper examines the ethics of contemporary managerial compensation in the context of executive stock options. Economic considerations would dictate that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate the effect of overall stock market movements which are beyond the control of the executive. However, in practice, most executive stock options are not adjusted to control for these outside factors. Agency considerations are the most likely culprit. Adjusting for the influence of outside factors, such as a generally rising stock market, from executive stock options sets a higher bar for managers to reach. Furthermore, traditional accounting standards permitted firms that did not adjust options to avoid reporting options as expenses. This presents CEOs and boards of directors with a major ethical dilemma. On the one hand, their duty to their shareholders and stakeholders dictates that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate outside noise from unrelated movements in the overall stock market. However, financial statements are presented in the language of accounting. If the overwhelming majority of the users of a language define a particular item in one way, then to deviate from the norm implies that the recipient of such a deviant statement may not properly interpret the statement. Likewise, if the standard practice is for firms to use unadjusted options and thus under-report expenses, to deviate from this industry norm risks that users of financial statements would not properly interpret the financial statements, with perhaps negative consequences for the shareholders. In short, if "everyone else does it," then it could be wrong for an individual firm to deviate from the norm as that would harm the shareholders. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Research about boards and governance has been characterized by the dominance of few concepts and a limited number of methods. This article introduces methods and concepts that help us explore board processes. Six illustrative studies of board processes are presented, including the use of 'one of the lads' - methods, 'flies on the wall' - methods, interpretation of 'board life stories' of women directors, reconstructive case studies and the use of questionnaire surveys directed to multiple respondents in each case. The article shows directions for how to open the 'black box' of board processes.

During recent decades boards have mostly been studied within a framework of corporate governance where the interests of external investors are emphasized. We will here break some new ground, offering a major survey on boards of directors throughout various European countries, and opening up the hitherto unexamined area of study of board behaviour and the workings of the value creating board. A framework is presented including concepts such as: the knowledge and diversity of board members; trust and interactions inside and outside the boardroom; board leadership and structure; boardroom decision-making; and corporate entrepreneurship and innovation. The value creation of boards is not only related to value protection for certain shareholders or value distribution to various stakeholders, but also to value creation throughout the whole value chain - as in relation to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship, for example.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

In this study, we examine firm and board characteristics that predict whether a new CEO will come from the firm's current management, from the board of directors, or from outside the firm. This study is the first to recognize the potential for outside board members to compete for the CEO position. Though classified as firm outsiders, outside directors have many of the advantages of insider candidates for CEO: firm-specific knowledge and familiarity with the board of directors. This form of succession is likely to be valuable in high-technology industries, as competition is faster paced and information asymmetry is greater than in lower technology industries. In this study, we focus on a single high-tech industry (semiconductors) in the period between 1993 and 2000. We find that the presence of an heir-apparent increases the likelihood of insider succession while outsider board members' availability increases the likelihood that an outside director will become the new CEO. We also find that firms with high levels of R&D spending and rapid sales growth favor insiders as new CEOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the CEO's relationship with the board.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

Purpose - This paper characterizes the role of the board of directors in a more specific way than has been done previously, and uses this characterization to support the argument that, in some cases, the mandate of an effective board should go beyond the prevention of self-interested behavior by management. The enlarged role for the board of directors that this paper contemplates carries with it the need to ensure shareholders that the board of directors is not engaging in self-interested behavior of its own, and posits that requiring the board of directors to report to shareholders on its activities and effectiveness is a potential solution to this problem. The paper seeks to present theoretically grounded ideas on how this might be done in a meaningful fashion. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a "short list" of reporting items for boards of directors, derived from a theoretical model that examines board of director performance from a group dynamics perspective. Findings - This paper proposes measure for board of director performance reporting that are based upon potential active agency roles. The authors suggest that future dialogue regarding board of director performance reporting might be well served by recognizing the limitations of previous research that has found differing and questionable links between board characteristics and organizational outcomes. Research limitations/implications - The authors suggest that the items derived from the theoretical model for examining board of director performance reporting need to be empirically assessed in terms of their usefulness in a variety of industries and contexts. Practical implications - The authors argue that active agency roles and functional group dynamics should form the backbone of a board of director performance reporting process. Originality/value - This paper extends the board of director performance reporting literature by providing a theoretically grounded rationale for measuring and conceptualizing board effectiveness.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of the characteristics related to the ownership structure and board of directors, as mechanisms of governance, on the research and development (R&D) intensity. The study carried out on a sample of French companies belonging to the SBF 250 index shows that ownership concentration and duality of chief executive officer and chairman roles have no significant effect on the R & D intensity. The board sizes as well as the proportion of inside directors in the board have a positive and significant effect on R & D intensity. However, the participation of outside directors in capital tends to urge managers to reduce R&D investment level.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

This study analyses the influence of various characteristics of the Board of Directors on the control and risk of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It also examines the effect on these variables of some of the CEO personal characteristics and of various contingencies of the firm. The results reveal that control of the CEO compensation is determined fundamentally by the CEO participation in the capital of the firm, while the level of risk of the CEO compensation package is higher when the firm is diversified and implements a proactive competitive strategy.

In this paper the conceptual frameworks, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm risk-taking behaviour, are examined. From a sample of 243 Australian listed firms, it is found that leadership structure does not have any significant influence on firm risk; higher blockholder ownership or lower dividend payout is related to increased performance variance. This research suffers from some limitations; the archival study of the functional background of board chairman may not reveal the underlying relationship between the board of directors and firm risk-taking behaviour. We only test the influence of leadership structure on performance variance; further research could investigate the potential impact of board composition on firm risk-taking propensity.

In this paper several theories, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm performance, are tested. The results indicate that, for Australian listed companies, there is no strong relationship between leadership structure and subsequent performance. It is reported that companies with higher blockholder ownership or lower managerial shareholdings tend to have an affiliated chairman; firm with higher managerial shareholdings tend to have an executive chairman. The evidence suggests that there is no one optimal leadership structure; each structure, which could be an outcome of a rational choice process influenced by other governance characteristics of individual firms, may have associated costs and benefits.

The IPO process may potentially introduce or increase agency costs. The newly public firm must deal with these agency problems. We find that following an IPO, the CEO compensation structure on average becomes more pay and performance-sensitive, and the board of directors becomes more independent. Venture capitalist participation seems to positively influence these findings. However, these post-IPO changes do not lead to better short-run operating performance.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

This study examines whether the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board of directors is associated with firms' timeliness in the remediation of material weaknesses (MWs) in internal control. The sample comprises accelerated filers that disclosed at least one MW from July 2003 to December 2004 under section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Using logistic regression analyses, I find that firms with larger audit committees, audit committees with greater nonaccounting financial expertise, and more independent boards are more likely to remediate MWs in a timely manner. These results suggest that the audit committee and the board play an important role in monitoring the remediation of MWs. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board under the SOX regime. The study also identifies important determinants of firms' timeliness in the remediation of MWs, which is key to improving financial reporting quality and restoring investor confidence. (c) CAAA.

It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Debates about the ethics of executive compensation are dominated by familiar themes. Many writers consider whether the amount of pay CEOs receive is too large-relative to firm performance, foreign CEO pay, or employee pay. Many others consider whether the process by which CEOs are paid is compromised by weak or self-serving boards of directors. This paper examines the issue from a new perspective. I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms. Accepting excessive compensation leaves the beneficiaries of their duties (e.g., shareholders) worse off, and thus is inconsistent with observing those duties. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Purpose - This paper aims to review how corporate governance is institutionalised in Nigeria and examine the relationship between board size, CEOs' duality, board composition and the board's involvement in strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was sent by post to the chairmen of 138 publicly quoted companies in Nigeria in November 2004. Findings - Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the Nigerian public companies have embraced some principles of the Code of Best Practices for Public Companies. There is a high level of board involvement in strategy decision-making process, but no correlation was found between board involvement and a number of governance variables (board size, board independence and CEO duality). Research limitations/implications - The sample of 39 responding companies is small although it represents a 28 per cent of response rate and is representative of the Nigerian stock market. However, we are unable to look at other factors such as industry sectors and we cannot generalise our findings regarding corporate governance practices in Nigeria. Practical implications - The investment climate in Nigeria can become more reassuring than in the past although there is room for further improvements as the effectiveness of the corporate government practices is still in doubt. Originality/value - This paper adds to the scanty literature available on corporate governance practices in developing, countries. Findings extend our understanding about the strategic functions of the board in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, and the world's sixth larger producer of oil.

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

This research study focuses on the problems involved in nominating board members based solely on rules and regulations, which neglect the affective dynamics of board behaviour and board process. For example, choosing board candidates who are independent (not part of a company's management), a rule imposed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) guidelines, may ensure that an organisation remains listed on this lucrative exchange. However, it does not ensure that the candidates have the necessary knowledge or are well versed in the company's business activities to effectively serve on a particular board. Having independent board members does not ensure that they ask tough questions of themselves or of management or that they have an extensive network from which to draw for advice on strategic issues. These are equally important areas of board governance that cannot be ignored when choosing candidates for the board, and these questions should not be suppressed in favour of concentrating solely on formal concerns such as independence. Information about board characteristics can provide management theorists with a broader range of informal variables that can contribute to the decision-making process. Board characteristics assist the board in operating as a team, improving the efficiency of the board. Selecting board members with the most suitable and effective characteristics for a particular board ensures that directors are spending their limited time on the company's most important challenges. This research was carried out in several stages in order to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In this research there was a significant relationship for values and decision-making and no relationship for TSXFormal and decision-making, which is consistent with the literature, suggesting there must be a change in executives values to ensure changes in behaviour. A corporate governance model was developed. This model helps in ensuring that boards populated with board members who have knowledge and values (skills matrices) are more aware of the detrimental effect that groupthink can have on the decision-making process. Several executives mentioned the ability of board members to apply due diligence to strategic decision-making. This means that directors apply their experience and expertise to better understand issues and bring these to bear upon the decision-making process. Additionally, knowledge, values and groupthink (skill matrices) may be used both when nominating new board members and as an annual evaluative tool. Businesses are continually diversifying and board members need to continuously embellish their skill set and knowledge in order to adapt. However, the finding and the development of this corporate governance model are significant as they mark the start of how board characteristics can be operationalised. What is needed is more balanced research that looks at both the formal and the informal system. In doing so, more articulate measures of board decision-making process will evolve. The business environment is ever changing and dynamic; research in these areas will convey the interrelationship between the formal and informal system. Nevertheless, this research is unique as it has investigated the formal and informal system using both primary qualitative and quantitative data analysis and therefore provides much needed information about the characteristics requisite for nominating board members.

Combining human capital theory and equity theory, we developed and tested a model in which the outside directors' total cash compensation is related to the outsider's profile, as well as to the board and firm characteristics. Consistent with our model, characteristics of the outsider's profile, in terms of his/her role and responsibility, meeting activities and length of service, are relevant. Only the director's popularity, as a part of his/her human capital, has a significant effect on his/her compensation. Our empirical results confirm the necessity to create a stronger link between the remuneration policies of the outsider directors and their contribution in a board, in terms of human capital. The remuneration policies adopted by firms should be linked to practices on corporate governance useful for helping outsiders contribute confidently to their work of the board and receive ongoing support and information so they can develop their understanding of the total environment within they work. Then, we suggest having recourse to qualifications and professional skills as well as to specific training or board induction programmes defined by firms themselves. Finally, the Combined Code should promote the adoption and spreading of such practices on market. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the argument that formal regulations alone may not be the defining factor in improving corporate governance and the decision making process of the BOD. Design/methodology/approach: Based on 20 semi-structured interviews with board chairs, members of corporate boards, CEOs, and upper/executive management at 12 Canadian companies, a bird's eye view is taken from the top. A content analysis of the interviews was performed. a clear picture about the interaction and behaviour of directors emerged. Subsequently, three objectives that are required for effective decision-making were developed: knowledge; motivation; and transmission channels/internal control. The analysis offers three critical objectives, which all boards should endeavour to accomplish. Findings: These interviews demystify board process and provide the bases for three critical objectives for effective corporate governance: ascertain and embellish the knowledge base of directors; motivate directors to share and gather information; and ensure clear and fluent transmission channels exist. Practical implications: The usual board measures such as CEO duality, insider and outsider ratio, number of board members and directors' share ownership may not be the only critical determinants of board effectiveness. Originality/value: Conventional notions of decision making have neglected key human faculties and individual characteristics that combine to determine organizational outcomes. This paper fulfils a need for research in the area of board processes and board decision making and provides a roadmap to improve corporate governance within organizations.

Golden parachutes are often viewed as a form of excessive compensation because they provide senior management with substantial payouts following an acquisition while other stakeholders are subjected to layoffs, disrupted business relationships and other negative externalities. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms, an economic and ethical justification for this type of contract is given. Golden parachutes ensure effective corporate governance that, in turn, preserve the firm's value for all stakeholders. Boards of directors enter into parachute agreements to protect recently hired CEOs' human capital during periods of financial uncertainty and, thus, potential takeover activity. From an ethics viewpoint, golden parachutes are valuable to all stakeholders because they encourage merger or acquisition in lieu of bankruptcy. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA; evaluate the corporate governance alternatives to "sayonpay" legislation; recommend a policy encouraging enhanced executive accountability; and suggest research questions pertaining to "sayonpay" proposals and executive compensation for scholars to pursue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes an exploratory approach to discussing and analyzing the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA and offering an alternative corporate governance approach to enhancing executive performance. Findings - The paper finds that whether an annual nonbinding "sayonpay" policy is instituted or not within a company is not the crux of the executive compensation issue. What is important is whether concerned shareholders have the ability to have proxy access and successfully pass such a resolution, thereby exercising shareholder pressure on the board of directors to implement a corporate policy of equating appropriate executive compensation with managerial performance. Moreover, this improvement in boardshareowner engagement, along with expanded disclosure of executive compensation packages, will assist in obviating the need for the exercise of a draconian shareholder resolution to remove directors. Originality/value - This paper offers an indepth review of the "sayonpay" legislative and corporate governance controversy; places the issue in the context of effective corporate governance; recommends a reasoned approach to executive compensation accountability; and offers a list of research questions for corporate governance and human resource management scholars to pursue.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Our study investigates an unexplored succession process-interim CEO successions. We define an interim CEO succession as a case where the title of chief executive officer is vacated by the incumbent and the board of directors has not announced a permanent successor, but instead designates a particular individual as 'interim CEO,' or 'acting CEO,' or 'CEO until a permanent successor is named.' Theory predicts that interim CEO successions will lead to the type of disruption that can harm firm performance, even after a permanent successor is appointed. Our data show that interim CEO succession processes are widely employed by publicly-traded U.S. firms, and that they are associated with lower performance during the period in which the interim serves. However, whether the interim CEO also simultaneously serves as chairman moderates the impact of this type of succession on firm performance, as well as on long-term firm survival.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the influence of corporate board structure on corporate value. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected on a sample of 245 Thai non-financial listed companies to examine the effect of board structure on firm performance. Findings: The results show that neither independent directors nor grey directors are the significant determinants of improving firm value. Research limitations/implications: This research was confined to 245 Thai non-financial listed companies. It would be useful to replicate it using larger samples under different country settings. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance to top managers in deciding the Board structure as corporate value is also grounded in corporate board structure. Originality/value: The paper provides far reaching implications for corporate managers about the relationship between Board characteristics and corporate value. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Why did the majority of directors prior to the financial crisis not have the foresight to predict the problems of taking on too much risk? We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Compared to the debate on corporate governance in the private sector and to the literature on the macro level of governance in the public sector, the micro-level governance of public organisations remains a neglected area of discussion. Against this backdrop, the paper presents an overview of international literature regarding boards in the public sector organisations, in order to evidence if, and in which terms, the board of directors has been a topic of research in public governance in the recent years. In conclusion, the paper provides suggestions for future research on boards in public organisations. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of corporate governance by analyzing the impact of board structure on firm technical efficiency. Resampling methods and bootstrapping techniques applied in Data Envelopment Analysis are used to evaluate firm performance. Truncated regressions are estimated to determine the effect of five board characteristics-board size, board independence, board reputation, board diversity and board activity-on efficiency. The result of this empirical study shows that business technical efficiency increases with a heterogeneous board with a limited number of directorships per director and with a limited activity specified in a reduced number of annual board meetings with a higher number of specialized committees.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Literature on acquisition places more concern on the consequence of an acquisition event and pays less attention to what factors influence the motive for initiating the acquisition strategy of a firm. Through the lenses of organizational learning and corporate governance theories, the study examine whether the prior acquisition experience and board characteristics affect firms' acquisition behavior. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 92 acquisition events of Taiwanese electronics firms during the period from 1997 to 2007 by employing the survival function model. Empirical results indicate that business acquisition experience positively influence the inclination of the acquirer adopting a subsequent acquisition, while board characteristics do not relate to the likelihood of the acquirer making a subsequent acquisition. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for organizational learning and corporate governance theories in general and acquisition management in particular.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The number of foreigners appointed to top management teams has increased significantly over the past decade. However, the question of why some firms elect to employ foreign nationals in top executive positions remains unclear. This study tests competing explanations based on strategic fit, human capital and attraction-selection-attrition perspectives. Results from empirical tests utilizing a multi-level methodology on a sample of Swiss publicly listed companies suggest that degree of international diversification is positively associated with the likelihood of having a foreign executive, whereas human capital characteristics do not explain the propensity to employ a foreigner on the top management team. In addition, nationality diversity at the board level, as well as the international experience of the top management team, predict the probability of having a foreign top executive.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the power dynamics of the boards of directors in family-owned and listed Turkish companies. Power and dominance in the boardroom can be studied in relation to three variables: the institutional environment in which the firm is embedded; the structural configurations of the board; and the top manager's propensity to exercise his/her power resources. Focusing on the board level, this paper aims to conceptualize power dynamics as being composed of structural attributes, roles assumed, responsibilities, dependency and representation. Design/methodology/approach: The research domain of this exploratory study is family-owned and listed companies operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The data for the study were collected from three different sources: a survey administered to members of the boards of directors; discourse analysis of corporate governance compliance reports of the same companies; and in-depth interviews conducted with board members. Findings: This study shows that on a typical board of directors of a family-owned and listed Turkish company, the interests of owners and managers are aligned and other stakeholders are not represented; the role of the board is confined to visibility and legitimacy and does not include control. Originality/value: This paper argues that theories developed for Anglo-Saxon equity-market based business systems have limited exploratory power for an emerging economy - namely Turkey - that is based on a business system characterized by close co-operation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets.

Purpose - The paper aims to study the effect of tenure on the structure of CEO compensation. The relation between CEO compensation and CEO tenure provides a good testing bed for many effects: the managerial power effect, the portfolio consideration effect, the learning effect, and the career concern effect. Design/methodology/approach - Tobit regressions were run of the percentage of equity-based compensation on CEO tenure and the effect of tenure compared between inside CEOs and outside CEOs. Findings - It was found that the percentage of equity-based compensation increases during the early years of tenure for outside CEOs, and decreases during the later years of tenure for inside CEOs. Before they are tenured, outside CEOs have significantly higher and faster growing percentage of equity-based compensation than inside CEOs. Furthermore, the portfolio consideration effect and the learning effect are the major effects in explaining the effect of tenure on the compensation structure. Practical implications - The evidence that boards of directors take into account the CEOs' holdings of equity incentives, the types of CEOs, and their years on tenure to adjust the structure of CEO compensation indicates that firms should, and do, try to optimize their CEO compensation structure on the basis of firm-specific or CEO-specific characteristics. It is suggested that there is no simple formulaic approach to governance reform.

This paper analyses how the composition and ownership structure of boards of directors affect firms' R&D investments. Most research on the impact of the board focuses on corporate performance in an Anglo-American context. This study explores the influence of the board on R&D investments in the Spanish corporate governance system, which is different from the British and US systems. Data from 86 Spanish quoted companies in technology industries show that board composition influences R&D investments. Further, our results indicate that ownership structure can moderate the relation between board composition and R&D investments. This study states opposing hypotheses, based on arguments from agency and stewardship theories. We use these theories to analyse the influence of the board on R&D investments as a key factor for success in highly competitive technology industries. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

Recent research into the role of boards of directors has adopted a cognitive point of view rather than a traditional governance perspective rooted in agency theory (Charreaux and Wirtz, 2006). The present study examines the structural embeddedness of boards and the influence of networks of boards of directors on the adoption of corporate governance practices. More specifically, it focuses on two aspects of social capital, namely the cohesion between actors within dense and closed networks (Coleman, 1988), and openness within networks containing numerous structural holes (Burt, 1992). The main results of this study emphasize the crucial role of board's network openness in the adoption of corporate governance practices and the importance of the diversity of cognitive resources acquired by boards of directors within their social networks.

This article presents both theoretical and empirical support for a movement from a traditional governance research paradigm towards a more holistic research approach. This includes taking into account behavioural, contingency and evolutionary theories, in an effort to better understand governance processes and effective board behaviour. Specifically, the authors highlight the importance of three groups of relationships (board dynamics, board-management relationships and board-stakeholder relationships) as contributing to good governance practice. Whilst historically researchers have largely ignored the behavioural aspects of corporate governance, the authors have made an attempt to open the 'black box' of governance processes and practices, and illustrate with examples from three New Zealand companies how the development of these relationships are important for effective board functioning.

This study explores the influence Boards of Directors' demographic characteristics on the process of making strategic decisions. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 105 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The results suggest that educational level affect both the financial reporting and the hierarchical decentralisation in the strategic decision-making process. Also, functional background of executives was found to be related with financial reporting. However, the educational specialty did not appear to have any significant influence on the strategic decision-making process. In light of these findings, implications for practitioners are made and avenues for future research are suggested.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

This paper uses a sample of 76 family businesses in Tunisia to investigate the impact of the family firm dynamic on the composition of their boards of directors. We argue that whether or not a transition in ownership is planned, firms have different governance needs and characteristics depending on the generational phase. The empirical results show that board composition is positively influenced by both generational evolution and succession planning. This study provides evidence of an increase in the appointment of outside directors to boards of family firms from the third generation of ownership. This result implies that it is important to consider the generational phase and succession process of the family firm in order to better understand its governance system.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance structure and performance of Indian companies. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of selected board characteristics and ownership structure on the firm performance. This analysis ranges over a period of six years, from 2001-02 to 2006-07 and is based on Pharmaceutical and IT industry. Least square dummy variable regression model has been used to study the relationship. We find that while board size, listing status of firm and foreign shareholding has positive and significant relationship with firm performance, public shareholding has negative and significant impact. However, independent director proportion, participation rate of independent directors and separation of Chairman and CEO post does not have a significant relationship with firm performance.

Board of directors deal with complex, strategic issues and conflict among members is natural. Group conflict is often associated with reduced productivity and lower cohesiveness. However, conflict might also improve group decision making and governance practices. This paper seeks to examine the relationship among the following: (a) three types of conflict (cognitive, affective and process) and board performance; (b) board performance and firm performance; and (c) the mediating role of board performance on board conflict and firm performance. It was found that only cognitive conflict is (positively) related to board performance. In addition, board performance does not impact firm performance nor board performance mediates the relationship between board conflict and firm performance. (c) 2010, SAGE Publications Ltd.

We present a set of factors which can contribute to the effectiveness of boards of directors in managing strategy implementation. Following more recent research strands on corporate governance and boards, we focus on non-structural factors related to cognitive, behavioral, work process and power dimensions. They may enhance the explanatory power of structural features of boards where the latter's effectiveness is concerned. The identified factors are cohesiveness, presence of knowledge and skills, use of knowledge and skills, effort norms, cognitive conflict, task performance and information architecture. They were divided into sets of observable variables, which were consolidated into an instrument - reference lists - with a view to helping scholars and practitioners in assessing how boards rank in these factors.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

We develop and test a novel theory about strategic noise with regard to CEO appointments. Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to evidence the disclosure practices of Spanish companies in relation to a voluntary typology of strategic information; and to determine the factors that explain these practices. Among the factors considered, the study seeks to focus on the role of the Board of Directors in depth. According to Agency Theory, strategic information has positive consequences on external funds costs. On the other hand, Proprietary Costs theory limits these practices, given that they can lead to competitive disadvantages. Design/methodology/approach: First, online strategic information disclosure practices are analysed by examining non-financial quoted Spanish firms. A disclosure index is created, and subsequently, certain factors related to corporate governance - Activity, Size and Board Independence - as well as other factors traditionally analysed, are used to explain the volume of strategic information disclosed on the internet. Findings: The results indicate that Spanish companies, on average, give out little strategic information, mainly related to objectives, their mission, and the company's philosophy. "Company annual planning" and "Information on risks" are scarcely disclosed. The findings also emphasise that companies where the Chairperson of the Board is the same person as the CEO and, moreover, in which there is a lower frequency of meetings, disclose a greater amount of strategic information on their web sites. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the disclosure of strategic information is a decision taken by executives with the aim of satisfying the demands of creditors and investors. The Board of Directors represents the shareholders' interests, but it does not participate in strategic decision-making disclosure, maybe due to the fact that the proprietary costs lack influence. Originality/value: The link between corporate governance and strategic information disclosed online has scarcely been analysed in previous literature. This study provides interesting insights into how several Board characteristics can affect the disclosure of strategic information on the internet. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

This study explores the competing influences of different types of board interlocks on diffusion of a strategic initiative among a population of firms. We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption. We discuss the implications of our study for social network analysis, governance, and internationalization research. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

This paper develops an analytical framework to depict the heterogeneity that characterises the role of board chair and demonstrate the potential variability in how chairs operate boards and exercise power and influence on strategy, control and resource related tasks at board level. Theories of power and influence, as applied to top management teams and boards of directors, are explicated within the context of contemporary governance practices that are establishing the role of the board chair as distinct to that of the chief executive officer. Specifically, the paper maps sources of power and varying contemporary chair practices, including chair nomenclature (i. e. executive vs. non-executive chairs), chair origin (insider vs. outsider) and chair time (full-time vs. part-time). A number of theoretical chair-power models emerge from this analysis and are subject to empirical analysis using data collected from 160 chairs of 500 FTSE-listed companies. Theoretically and empirically, the paper complements structural approaches to studying boards with attention to behaviour on boards. By linking board structure, board process and the exercise of influence, the study reveals both differences amongst chairs in how they run the board, but also that chairs' differ in the influence they exert on board-related tasks. Full-time executive chairs exert their greatest influence in strategy and resource dependence tasks whereas part-time, non-executive chairs seem to exert more influence over monitoring and control tasks.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to attempt to verify the predicted relationship between the demographic (i.e. tenure, functional background, etc.) difference and cognitive difference among top managers and examine how such a relationship is affected by the communication among top managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal manager on a TMT, and that such a relationship is mediated by the degree of communication that the focal manager has with other team members on the TMT. Using Structural Equation Modeling techniques, these hypotheses were tested based on a sample of 348 top managers that consist of 28 top management teams. Findings: It was found that the hypothesized relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal top manager was supported with respect to the tenure of a manager, but not the functional background of a manager. Moreover, it was found that communication frequency of a focal manager with other team members mediated the relationship between the tenure deviation and the cognitive deviation of the focal manager and that tenure deviation negatively influenced communication frequency, which in turn, negatively influenced the cognitive deviation of the manager. Practical implications: These findings imply that: when constructing a competitive top management, practitioners such as boards of directors of a firm should pay more attention to the tenure diversity of a top management team because tenure diversity influences the cognitive diversity of the team; and communication among members of a management team can reduce the cognitive differences among members. However, communication happens more frequently among managers with similar tenure than among managers with dissimilar tenure. To promote consensus, managers need to watch for the forming of group fault lines along tenure within their teams. Originality/value: As far as is known, this is the first study that uses relational demography to examine the influence of tenure difference on cognitive difference among members of a top management team and to expose a mediating role played by communication frequency.

Identifying, attracting, and maintaining the engagement of the right composition of people for a non-profit Board is a major challenge. Executives should ensure that their Boards accurately represent the stakeholders that matter, both from industry and the community. The purpose of this paper is to describe ways and offer propositions for effective non-profit executives to identify, recruit, and motivate the continuing engagement of the members needed on their Boards in order to acquire resources critical to their sustained success. The Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) are used as an example, since at least 93 percent of CVBs have a governance structure that includes a Board of Directors. Successfully attracting the right mix of stakeholders is a result of an extensive recruitment effort by the CVB executive. Prior research reports that successful executives take great care in making selection decisions that reflect the interests of the community in the Board's composition. Based on the literature on Boards and governance, the authors develop propositions regarding the composition of CVB Boards. While the research is exploratory, it is found that CVBs with more diverse Boards are more successful than those with less diverse Boards. It is argued that effective CVBs use a thoughtful process for heterogeneous Board selection. It is also suggested that Board performance should be evaluated on an annual basis to recognize the need for active involvement in the Board selection process. The successful selection of Board members is important because of the implications for Board effectiveness. While there is a large body of literature offering advice on Board selection, there is little on recruitment. Moreover, there is little discussion of Board composition strategy based on balancing access to critical resources of stakeholders. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

In the recent years the Russian Government has undertaken serious steps to improve corporate governance practices by introducing the Corporate Code of Governance (CCG) and strengthening the role of corporate boards to monitor top management performance. This paper investigates whether these measures have stimulated positive changes by increasing the demand for higher quality audit. We test our hypotheses using 147 non-listed companies to examine whether board composition influences audit fee in the Russian capital market. Our findings support the demand-side perspective of audit services and suggest that audit fees are associated positively with the presence of an independent chairman, higher proportion of independent directors and State representatives on the board.

The study seeks to understand how the firm's ownership structure and the board of directors' composition influence the structural capital. The latter is apprehended by three main levers: TMT compensation, innovation, and firm's reputation. By mobilizing several panel linear regressions on 274 American firms, the results show that the firms which heavily invest in structural capital are more successful and chaired by the younger and heterogeneous TMT. No disciplinary effect of the board on structural capital has been found. The results support the cognitive theory assumptions. The classic perspective failed to explain the structural capital phenomena. In order to enhance their structural capital, firms must pay a close attention to their board cognitive contribution and not to its disciplinary role.

This paper examines the effects of director ownership and the proportion of outside directors on firms' commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using a sample of 453 Hong Kong listed companies for 2005, we find that there is a non-linear relationship between the level of director ownership and firms' engagement in CSR behavior. Commitment to CSR first increases as the proportion of director ownership increases up to 50% and then decreases as that proportion of ownership grows higher. Further, the proportion of outside directors on the board exhibits a positive relationship with the level of CSR commitment. These results provide explanations for firms' commitment to CSR from the corporate governance perspective.

The failure of the CEO has been studied at great length in the literature. We order and classify the factors that lead to CEO failure into those a CEO can influence (endogenous) and those that are given (exogenous). The absence of unanimity in the literature leads us to conclude that insufficient attention has been paid to the main factor: the personal characteristics of CEOs. The agency approach and method are insufficient to understand leadership performance in organizations, due to the oversimplified view of human nature on which they are based and their heavy reliance on mathematical modeling.

The recent financial crisis highlighted the issue of Board of Directors compensation, which had been analyzed by many authors. In fact, there is a vast academic literature on the impact of the compensation of Board of Directors on corporations characterized by the separation of ownership from control. The compensation of Board of Directors has been a subject of debate, also by global regulators like OECD, FSB, Central Bank of Italy and European Commission and many are pushing for an international uniform regulation. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the board of Directors compensation, the company performance and the risks decided by the Board. The article analyses a sample of Italian listed companies in order to test wether or not the Board of Directors compensation structure could turn into a performance incentive, given the risk taken.

This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

There is a growing consensus that boards of directors "matter," but the specific effects of board influences on organizational innovation remain unclear. Although boards of directors have been studied extensively in diverse disciplines-finance, management, sociology, nonprofit management, and economics-those studies have focused primarily on how board variables influence organizational effectiveness and performance. Missing from these studies is explanation of the relationships between the board of directors and organizational innovation (Wu, 2008a). This article links previous research and theories on governance and organizational innovation, examines how the board of directors may influence organizational innovation, and presents an integrative model that includes direct and indirect linkages between the board demographic and process variables, board effectiveness, and organizational innovation.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effects of corporate governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, and executive bonus pay in Japanese firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of the largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth and bonus pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability and bonus pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability and bonus pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth and bonus pay relationship. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study makes a contribution to research on ownership heterogeneity and executive compensation by empirically showing that different owners and directors affiliated with certain ownership groups have varied implications on the firm performance-executive pay relationship. It also makes a contribution to research on corporate governance change by providing insights on how different actors facilitate shifts in the linkage between performance and pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

Using a sample of U.S. lodging firms, this paper examines the relationship between board of director characteristics and chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Previous research shows that larger boards are detrimental to the effectiveness of the board of directors and deteriorate the control imposed on CEO actions and pay. Board independence is also suggested as an important quality to emphasize the control on the CEO. We propose that U.S. lodging firms' board of directors provide a nice setting to investigate the effects of size and independence on CEO compensation level. Our findings suggest that CEO compensation is not related to board size, and positively related to proportion of the outside board members. These findings are contrary to the findings of previous studies. Our findings may provide significant insights to lodging firms' board of directors to structure efficient compensation packages.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

Business educators have a responsibility to ensure that future managers, employees, and shareholders are well versed in governance. Governance provides a vital link between organizations and society, allowing people to place their trust in an organization, support its mission, and ensure a continuing flow of resources to accomplish the mission. This article discusses coursework in board governance that combines a 5-month internship on a community nonprofit board with academic class work on governance topics to create a unique learning opportunity. The course combines elements of internship, mentorship, and service learning with more traditional academic activities such as lectures, guest speakers, research, and analysis. Students gain greater awareness of the needs of the broader community and the challenges of serving them. The community gains from a growing pool of people with governance knowledge and skills who understand the value of community service. (c) OBTS Teaching Society for Management Educators 2012.

This paper examines the relationship between the characteristics of boards of directors and the financial distress of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The sample consists of 68 companies whose listing status on Bursa Malaysia was being suspended between 2005 and 2009, under the provision of Practice Note 17 (PN17) of the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirements. The study develops a multinomial logit regression model to test three categories of PN17 listing statuses: re-listed on Bursa Malaysia, remain as PN17, and de-listed from Bursa Malaysia. The model relates the listing status to five characteristics of the boards of directors as independent variables, specifically leadership structure, equity ownership, board involvement, financial literacy and multiple directorships of board members; and four control variables, namely firm size, leverage, return on assets and audit quality. The study expects that the success of PN17 listing outcomes depends on the ability of the board of directors to establish and implement the restructuring plan. The results show that the relisting of PN17 companies is negatively related to financial literacy and equity ownership of the board of directors and positively related to the involvement of the board. The results imply that boards of directors with a lower ownership and financial literacy, but more actively involved, are more capable of overcoming financial difficulties.

This paper examines whether efficiency monitoring has a positive influence on corporate performance by using the fixed effect model with panel data of listed firms in Taiwan from 2005 to 2010. The results show that having a shared interest group, formed by the controlling shareholders of a company and its board directors, leads to a failing monitoring function of the board of directors. Moreover, greater divergence between the number of board seats controlled and voting rights leads to a higher likelihood of corporate performance appearing to be an inverted curve. If this divergence exceeds a certain threshold, the interests of external shareholders may be harmed by large shareholders.Copyright (c) 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

This research deals with the review of researches on strategic decision making and the factors that has contributed to its growth and how it has affected the organisational performance. This study is focused on five major themes; decision making environment; comprehensiveness and speed/timing; Top Management Team (TMT), Chief Executive Officers (CEO's) and Board of Directors (BOD's); communication, information system and decentralised strategy and culture, hierarchical decentralisation and power distance, lateral communication and individualism, formahsation and uncertainty avoidance. It has been established that all these factors will lead to high organisational performance even in a turbulent business environment. The methodological approach of the reviewed researches is based on survey method with the use of questionnaire that makes the studies to be empirical in nature. (c) Medwell journals, 2012.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the effects of firm- and country-level "good" corporate governance prescriptions on firm performance before and during the recent financial crisis, using a large sample of 1,197 firms across 26 European countries. Research Findings/Insights: We propose a contextualized agency perspective suggesting that firm- and country-level good governance prescriptions designed to assure managerial oversight may not hold in a financial crisis. This is because firms can benefit from broadening managerial discretion so as to facilitate the exercise of initiative and decisive leadership. Overall, our firm- and country-level findings support this argument. In a crisis, CEO duality is associated with better performance. We also find that the use of incentive compensation and the existence of a wedge between ownership and control rights negatively impacts on firm performance in a crisis. Hierarchical linear modeling shows that 25 percent of the heterogeneity in firm performance is among countries, indicating the importance of including country-level institutions in our analyses. In a crisis, we find that the general quality of the legal system and creditor rights protection are positively related to firm performance, but protection for equity investors is not. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The findings challenge the universality of good governance prescriptions and contribute to the growing body of work proposing that the efficacy of governance mechanisms may be contingent upon organizational and environmental circumstances. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study offers insights relevant to policy and practitioner communities, showing that governance mechanisms operate differently in crisis and non-crisis periods. The tendency to respond to a crisis with more stringent rules may be counterproductive since such measures may compromise executives' ability to respond appropriately to systemic shocks. Practitioners are encouraged to optimize rather than maximize their governance choices. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

This study asserts that the effects of board characteristics on firm innovation need to be evaluated with reference to contingency variables. A literature review suggests that relatively few studies adopt a contingency view when examining the outcomes of boards of directors. This study examines the influence on firm innovation of characteristics such as board size, outsider ratio and board diversity, and suggests that their influence is contingent upon firm size. The model is tested on a sample of Italian companies and finds support for the contingency hypothesis. This study advances research on boards of directors by emphasizing the importance of context.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

When academic researchers, business commentators, and boards of directors have debated the merits of hiring new CEOs from outside the firm, the implicit or explicit assumption typically made is that outsider CEOs will provide an advantage in achieving strategic change. In this study, we challenge this assumption by employing a duality perspective on stability/change, and we provide an original conceptual framework to posit that it is the presence of corporate stability (ordinary succession, a long-tenured predecessor CEO, and good firm performance) that allows outsider CEOs to generate a greater degree of post-succession strategic change. We use extensive longitudinal data from US airline and chemical industries between 1972 and 2010 to test our hypotheses, and we discuss how our supportive findings challenge long-standing assumptions regarding the outsider succession-strategic change relationship, and we advocate embracing the non-intiutive notion that stable (unstable) conditions can be enablers (barriers) of strategic change for outsider CEOs.

Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to examine the influence of the educational qualifications of board members, including the CEO, on the financial performance of Indonesian listed firms. Indonesia is a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a sample comprising 160 firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) are used as measures of financial performance. It uses four proxies for board members' educational qualifications, namely postgraduate degrees, degrees obtained from prestigious universities, degrees obtained from developed countries, and degrees in financial disciplines. Regressions are performed separately for the supervisory board, management board, and CEO. Findings - This study provides empirical evidence that the educational qualifications of board members and the CEO matter, to a particular extent, in explaining either ROA or Tobin's Q. For example, CEOs holding degrees from prestigious domestic universities perform significantly better than those without such qualifications. Practical implications - Even though intellectual competence should appear to be one of the considerations in the appointment of board members, educational qualification is not always a good proxy for superior advising or managerial quality. There may be many other factors that need to be considered, such as experiences, managerial skills, networks, and other skills obtained outside schools. As such, the establishment of a nomination committee, which is expected to provide independent recommendations on qualified candidates to serve in the boardrooms, plays an important role. Originality/value - Empirical studies focusing on the influence of the educational backgrounds of board members and the CEO on financial performance are still rare in the literature. This study is among the first to address such an issue in the context of a developing economy. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A focus on preserving socioemotional wealth may influence entrepreneurial activities in family firms. In this paper, we identify the emotion of empathy in the family CEO as an antecedent of socioemotional wealth creation. We argue that the presence of one or more external directors can have a direct as well as moderating influence on the relationship between CEO's empathy and the salience of socioemotional wealth to the family CEO. Our empirical tests confirm these hypotheses. Several areas of future research are suggested to incorporate empathy and other emotions in family business studies.

This study investigates the link between female board directors and company financial performance and agency costs in Sri Lanka's publicly listed companies. In order to investigate the impact of board gender diversity on firm financial performance, a dynamic panel generalised method of moment estimation is applied. Three variables are used as proxies for gender diversity of the board of directors, namely the percentage of women on the board, a dichotomous dummy and the Blau index. A Tobit model with endogenous regressors is used to investigate the impact of female board members on agency cost, using growth opportunities as a measure of agency cost. After controlling for size, industry and other corporate governance measures, this study finds a significant negative relationship between the proportion of women on boards and firm value along with an increase in company agency cost. This evidence provides insights for governments and academic institutions in their efforts to provide resources that will help enhance women's leadership skills.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Despite growing interest in the board of directors of entrepreneurial firms, the role of outside board members in high tech start-ups has been largely neglected. This dearth of research is surprising since the high level of resource dependency these ventures face is likely to heighten the potential contribution outside board members can make. We argue that, for high tech start-ups, the service role the board plays will be crucial in overcoming resource dependencies. In contrast to existing studies that tie the outside boards' servicing role to board characteristics, we propose that greater attention needs to be paid to the resource profile of the venture. Building on resource dependency theory, we find that the extent to which the outside board members fulfil a service role is dependent on the initial human, financial and technological resource base of the entrepreneurial venture. Specifically, we find that ventures with less diversified teams, teams with lower levels of R&D experience and higher levels of financial experience and ventures earlier in the technological development process receive higher levels of support from the outside board.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

It is hypothesized in this study that the relationship between institutional ownership and inventory management is more likely to be moderated by other internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e., managerial ownership, board leadership structure and board size). This is more likely to happen as one weak governance mechanism in one area will be offset by a strong one in another area. Furthermore, the effectiveness of one corporate governance mechanism (i.e., institutional ownership) is more likely to be contingent on some contextual variables. Econometric analysis, using a sample of Egyptian listed firms, provides strong evidence for the applicability of this theme and demonstrates that institutional ownership affects inventory management positively (negatively) when managerial ownership is high (low), CEO duality (non-duality) is in place, or board size is large (small). This conclusion is robust to the use of different control variables and econometric models. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to concentrate on the prevailing agency theory along with its complementary theory of stewardship as foundations for the authors' research. Recent economic turmoil within the USA has resulted in stakeholders demanding change within governance policies of corporations. One such adjustment has been the separation of the CEO and Chairman positions within organizations. The authors' study seeks to uncover the extent to which duality CEO relationships exist in large corporations within the USA. In light of the push towards splitting the dual roles, the authors further investigated new CEOs recently appointed into the CEO position. Companies selected for this study were the top 500 revenue-producing companies in the USA as published by Fortune magazine in 2008. For comparison purposes, the authors' database included newly appointed CEOs coming on board with the original 2008 companies that had remained on the listing for both years as published by Fortune in 2010. The authors' 2008 database included 500 companies and their 2010 database included 86 companies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was the product classification used in order to establish the principal industry sector for companies under analysis. The authors' 2008 analysis reveals that 303 CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and Chairman, with 156 executives holding this combined title. The authors' 2010 analysis reveals that 33 new CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and President with 43 executives holding the title. The authors' analysis of retired CEOs reveals that 15 retired CEOs continue serving in the capacity of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Using the top 500 companies in the USA, based upon sales revenue, did limit the study to large corporations within the USA. The agency theory does provide an explanation of the duality movement witnessed in corporations. The practice of splitting duality roles of CEO and Chairman within public corporations appears to be becoming a reality within the USA, whether on a voluntary or a mandatory basis in order to enhance corporate independence and transparency.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance on the performance of 37 commercial banks in Kenya over the period 2005-2009. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two measures of performance, i.e. return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), and the dependent variables and three measures of governance - namely the board size, independent directors, and CEO duality - as the key independent variables. The study follows a panel econometrics technique to investigate the relationship between governance variables and bank performance. Findings: The main findings are as follows: a large board size tends to impact performance negatively; the existence of independent board directors tends to enhance the performance of the banks; and there is no evidence that CEO duality or otherwise has impact on the performance of commercial banks in Kenya. Practical implications: The study therefore recommends that for commercial banks in Kenya to register high performance they need to check the size of their board of directors and also increase the number of independent directors. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study on Kenya that has used advanced panel data techniques. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper examines the influence and causal relationship between board of directors independence, CEO duality, and firm value. By estimating multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, there resulted a positive influence of the percentage of independent directors on firm value, but down to a threshold of their representation of 47.23 percent, whereupon their influence becomes negative. When we employed fixed-effects models, the relationship previously mentioned was not statistically validated. However, the results provide support for a lack of statistically significant relationship between the percentage of non-executive directors and firm value. Besides, by estimating fixed-effects models we found a positive influence of CEO duality on industry-adjusted Tobin's Q ratio, but not statistically significant when estimating models without cross-sectional effects. The causal relationships between board independence and firm value identified based on Granger causality are not robust. (c) 2013, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This paper reports on the interaction of compositional effects of boards of directors (BoD) and top management teams (TMTs) on firms' financial performance. Composition of both groups is investigated for cultural, age, tenure and gender diversity. We explore effects of demographic diversity in the two power groups on performance in interaction with each other by bringing in the similarity-attraction paradigm to argue for the relationship. Study data are from consolidated financial statements in annual reports of listed Swedish corporations. Our findings suggest that while differences in gender, age and tenure diversities have no effect on firm performance, close alignment of cultural diversities of the BoD and TMT does have a positive effect of firm performance.

This paper examines the impact of board governance mechanisms, namely board size, independence ratio, opacity of earnings disclosure, and ratio of genuinely independent nonexecutive directors to total board size on director remuneration, executive tenure and likelihood of individual executive salary disclosure in a unique and comprehensive sample of 69 North African IPO firms. I find evidence of the enhanced governance role of true independent nonexecutives in family as opposed to non-family firms in improving disclosure of individual salaries and moderating lengths of executive tenure. However while their role is only significant in the context of family firms the evidence suggests that their presence is associated with higher levels of remuneration. The evidence also ascribes a greater role for business angel as opposed to more formal private equity financing which is more applicable within the highly social networked economy of the Maghreb region.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper contrasts firm-level as opposed to state-level governance on directors self-rewarding behaviour in West Africa. Director self-reward or compensation is measured through fixed base salary as well as total remuneration which provides a conservative estimate of the full private benefits of control of directors. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 56 IPO firms from across West Africa from 2000 to 2012, I find that larger board sizes have less effective governance mechanisms while enhanced expropriation of private benefits of control is closely associated with lower government promotion of private sector policies, media and analyst freedom and corruption control.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

As a result of the many governance failures in the past decade, new legislation, increased regulation, and best practices have been adopted by boards in an effort to improve corporate governance. Unfortunately, not all of the changes, such as increasing the number of external directors, have favorably impacted the quality of board governance. While having the majority of external directors on a board increases the board's independence from the CEO, these external directors lack inside directors' understanding of the firm's operations, customers and business model. The board members' lack of understanding presents a key challenge to CEOs, as their tenures depend on keeping their boards informed about the firm's business model. If CEOs are to succeed in this new governance climate, they need to find a way to effectively explain the business model to external directors in order to educate them, access their competencies, and ensure their long term support. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the strategy map to communicate the firm's business model to the board. The paper used the authors' experiences, a review of the literature, and a case study as a basis for making recommendations presented in the article. Outside directors may struggle to understand the firm's business model. While some may argue this is not the CEO's problem as it is the board's role to govern and management's job to manage, the authors argue it is an important issue for CEOs for two reasons: First, if the board does not understand the impact of changes to a firm's business model then CEOs are not fully leveraging their boards' expertise. Second, if CEOs do not keep the board adequately informed about the business model it hinders, rather than helps CEOs from building open and transparent relationships with their boards. By ensuring that directors receive the right information about the organization's business model and then have the opportunity to have a constructive dialog regarding the quality of the business model, CEOs can build trusting relationships with their boards and thus ensure they succeed over the longer term. Recent governance failures have demonstrated a need for better communication between boards and CEOs. This is one of the first papers to examine the role of the strategy map to communicate the firm's business model to the board. (c) 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

This paper undertakes a unique study of the determinants of corporate governance in the West African developing region and their impact on director compensation. A new measure of director total remuneration is constructed providing a conservative estimate of expropriation of private benefits of control. Using a hand-collected sample of 51 West African IPO firms from 2000 to 2011 we find evidence that increased presence of true independent nonexecutives that are unconnected to CEO or dominant insider groups within firm and nominally independent board level committees are highly associated with expropriation inferring that firm's with directors engaging in this behaviour are more likely to adopt measures indicative of governance best practice.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has awakened the regulators and corporates on the importance of corporate governance. In any country's economy, banking sector plays an important role for the better economy. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and disclosure quality of listed banks on Bursa Malaysia. Corporate governance variables tested in this study are the board leadership structure, board composition, board size, director ownership, institutional ownership and block ownership. The researchers developed the disclosure index and it will be checked against the information disclosed in the annual reports. Then, in calculating the weighted disclosure score, the views of accountants and financial analysts are also considered through survey questionnaire. The results reveal that better disclosure quality of the annual reports in banking sector can be achieved by having separate board leadership structure, higher proportion of independent non-executive directors, higher board size, lower ownership by the directors, institutional and block shareholders.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, 'horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

We examine the relationship between strategic change and CEO compensation by studying how a firm's refocusing program influences CEO compensation after completing the change. We contribute to the 'settling up' literature by arguing that strategic change is often uncertain for both the CEO and the board of directors responsible for executive compensation. As such the firm is likely to settle up with the CEO by paying for compensation risk and effort undertaken during refocusing after the extent and impact of strategic change are better known. We find that refocusing intensity is positively related to post-refocusing CEO total compensation, suggesting that 'settling up' through post hoc compensation is an important factor in strategic change. We also find that prior firm performance, governance structure and industry dynamism are important moderators of this relationship. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Purpose: This study aims to open up the black box of the boardroom by directly observing directors' interactions during meetings to better understand board processes.
Design/methodology/approach: We analyze videotaped observations of board meetings at two Australian companies to develop insights into what directors do in meetings and how they participate in decision-making processes. The direct observations are triangulated with semi-structured interviews, mini-surveys and document reviews.
Findings: Our analyses lead to two key fndings: while board meetings appear similar at a surface level, boardroom interactions vary significantly at a deeper level (i.e. board members participate differently during different stages of discussions), and factors at multiple levels of analysis explain differences in interaction patterns, revealing the complex and nested nature of boardroom discussions.
Research implications: Bydocumenting significant intra- and inter-board meeting differences, our study challenges the widespread notion of board meetings as rather homogeneous and monolithic, points towards agenda items as a new unit of analysis and highlights the need for more multi-level analyses in a board setting.
Practical implications: While policymakers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, our findings suggest that decision outcomes or roles' execution could be potentially affected by interactions at a board level. Differences in board meeting styles might explain prior ambiguous board structure-performance results, enhancing the need for greater normative consideration of how boards do their work.
Originality/value: This study complements existing research on boardroom dynamics and provides a systematic account of director interactions during board meetings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study examines how chief executive officer (CEO) compensation decisions may be influenced by a major group decision-making tendency referred to as group polarization among outside directors. I start by explaining why outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation when they previously witnessed relatively high (low) CEO compensation across different boards. Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority's prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors' power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it. Longitudinal analyses (1995-2006) of Fortune 500 CEOs' compensation provide support for these theoretical predictions. This study contributes to corporate governance research on CEO compensation by advancing a novel group decision-making approach to examining this important decision. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

The world-wide inflation in executive compensation in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of long-term incentives. This article demonstrates how the subjectively perceived value of long-term incentives is affected by risk aversion, uncertainty aversion, and time preferences. Based on a unique empirical study which involved collecting primary data on executive preferences from around the world, and using a theoretical framework which draws on behavioral agency theory, we conclude that, while long-term incentives are perceived by executives to be effective, they are not in fact an efficient form of reward, and that this outcome is not significantly affected by cross-cultural differences. We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of long-term incentive awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward.

Agency theory suggests that high pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) of CEO's compensation is an important motivation mechanism to the CEO to improve corporate performance. We develop a simple model that suggests that reverse causality should also be considered. Specifically, our model predicts that when good performance is expected, a powerful CEO will push for a contract with higher PPS. Data from 135 Israeli companies over a five-year period confirm the model's main prediction. Our empirical analysis shows that when the CEO is the chairman of the board of directors and thus is more powerful in affecting his compensation scheme, he achieves a high PPS in good periods (in terms of corporate performance), compared to similar powerful CEOs in periods of bad performance, and also compared to less powerful CEOs in good periods.

Purpose: Under IAS 24 a related party transaction (RPT) is a "transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged" (IASB). The purpose of this paper is to consider the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the parent company for the interpretation of the RPT. Considering the interest of the group means to interpret the intra-group transactions not as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on explanatory multiple case studies in order to answer the following research questions: why the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the subsidiaries by the parent company are important in the interpretation of RPTs. How RPTs can be interpreted in the light of the directing activity of the holding company. Findings: Dominant shareholder tends to demonstrate that the group it is not managed as a single economic entity and sometimes that subsidiaries are not really controlled. The case studies show that a regulation that imposes the transparency of the directing activity has at least two effects: the controlling shareholder finds it convenient to delegate the decision-making power and to not carry out RPTs among firms that do not present clear economic links. Thus, the transparency of the directing activity seems to be a disincentive to the establishment of a pyramidal group with expropriation purposes. Research limitations/implications: It is appropriate that the interpretation of the RPT take into account not only the disclosure of the RPT (e.g. type and nature), but also the following disclosure: the reason and the business purpose that lead to RPT; the interest of the company in engaging such transactions; and the procedures for their approval. The independence of subsidiaries directors is necessary to ensure the management autonomy of the boards, and in the case of directing activity they have to protect outsiders in the case of detrimental transactions ordered by the controlling and directing company that are not carried out in the interest of the group. Originality/value: Unlike what has been done so far by the literature on RPT, this paper considers the interest of the group to interpret the intra-group transactions and the separation between control and direction. It means do not interpret RPT as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 139 articles on board leadership that were published in business and management journals since 1980s. Journal names, author country affiliations, topics and focus levels, theories, empirical contexts, and methodologies are presented and analysed. We also assemble and analyse this data thematically in order to identify and frame developments and trends in researchers' ideas on board leadership. This analysis provides guidance for researchers by identifying different research streams on board leadership. The analysis may also serve as basis for theory development in board leadership research that can inform policymaking and best practice recommendations.

This study analyses the influence of board composition on companies' innovation in the Spanish corporate governance system. Drawing from a multi-theoretical perspective, the analysis shows the moderating effect of board member stock ownership on the relationship between board composition and innovation. Using secondary data from a sample of Spanishquoted companies in technology industries over the 2003-2005 period, the findings demonstrate that board composition influences the innovative behaviour of firms, and that this influence is also conditioned by directors' stock ownership because directors' attitude towards innovation could vary depending on their power and on how many shares they own. These results confirm that innovation increases in firms whose boards have a high proportion of affiliated directors with significant stock ownership. This study also makes some important contributions towards creating a more effective board that can shape companies' strategic orientation, highlighting the need to consider the joint impact of board composition and ownership concentration.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This research paper examines the relationship between the board of directors and the firm's performance from the angle of the R&D investment level in the French context and from some perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to show if the R&D investment level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the size of the board, and on the other hand, the performance. This empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationships between the variables linked to the composition of the board and the firm's performance are meditated by the firm's R&D investment level.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. (c) The Authors 2014.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

This paper examines the effectiveness of six institutional quality measures, namely corruption control, effective government, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability, in inhibiting self-rewarding behaviour of boards in terms of their compensation as well as in influencing the likelihood of disclosure of individual executive salaries in IPO listings prospectuses. Using a unique and comprehensive dataset of 78 hand-collected IPO firms from across North Africa from 2000 to 2012 I find substantial evidence that government effectiveness and corruption control are important in inhibiting director self-reward and expropriation while political stability is more associated with increased likelihood of transparency in reporting of salaries. In addition firms from poor informational environments are more likely to initiate enhanced self-governance and transparency so as to overcome institutional deficiencies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that CEO power can reduce the likelihood of director turnover as well as CEO turnover after fraud detection. Further, we find that CEO power is negatively related to long-term stock performance after fraud detection and this negative relationship is particularly strong for powerful CEOs when the board has a low overall turnover. These results imply that powerful CEOs can entrench themselves and survive corporate turbulence by potentially working with board members who are favorable to them.

Because CEO turnover events provide the board of directors with a unique opportunity to potentially completely restructure CEO compensation packages, changes to CEO compensation following a turnover event could prove to inform the ongoing debate regarding CEO compensation. This paper investigates what happens to CEO compensation when a turnover event occurs. Specifically, I examine CEO compensation levels and pay-performance sensitivity for incoming and outgoing CEOs involved in turnover events at public companies in the United States. My main findings are as follows: (1) incoming CEOs are paid as much as or more than those they replace, (2) outsider replacements are paid more than their predecessors even after controlling for education and skills, and (3) CEOs who are forced out are not paid differently from those who replace them, while CEOs who leave voluntarily are paid significantly less than their replacements. Further analysis reveals that proxies for managerial power including CEO tenure, CEO centrality, founder status, and high CEO ownership cannot explain these results. Overall, these findings are difficult to reconcile with the view that managerial power is the primary determinant of CEO compensation.

Co-operatives are defined by the International Co-operative Alliance as 'an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise'. Under the name co-operative, very different organisations coexist: consumer co-operatives, worker co-operatives, producers' co-operatives, co-operative banks, etc. However, in spite of different contexts and businesses, co-operatives share the same principles. Their goal is triple: to defend their values; to ensure the sustainability of the organisation in a long term approach; and to ensure an equitable distribution of profits. Being a co-operative involves answering requirements such as implementing a democratic management and defining terms of membership, but also appointing a board of directors that will represent members and defend their interests in a simultaneously individual and collective perspective. Few studies exist on the specific components of the role of directors in co-operative organisations and none explores the best practices of cooperative boards that could provide lessons for other kinds of organisation. The board of directors is a key player in governance. The role of the board is to monitor management (Baysinger and Hoskisson 1990; Jensen and Zajac 2004) and to provide guidance for strategy and decision-making (Walsh and Seward 1990; Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Golden and Zajac 2001).

Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a "professional board" of directors. The authors utilize state-of-the-art academic literature from the fields of corporate governance and organizational behavior to evaluate the merits and de-merits of the proposed corporate governance model, and present their findings (and recommendations) for improvements in corporate governance practices.

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

Purpose: Relative performance evaluation (RPE) involves board comparisons of firm performance to that of a peer group when evaluating CEO performance. To date, research on RPE in the USA has typically relied on models where RPE is implicitly assumed. In contrast, Bannister and Newman provide some direct evidence on the explicit RPE usage by US firms showing that it is limited and there is significant inter-industry variation in its use. The authors aim to focus on why boards in some industries employ RPE to a greater extent than those in other industries do using measures of industry discretion, industry homogeneity, industry competition. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize the sample use in the Bannister and Newman study of RPE usage in industries (160 firms from the 1992 Fortune 250 with proxy statements for 1992 and 1993). The authors compile measures of industry membership (using SIC codes), industry discretion, industry homogeneity, and industry competition from Compustat a well. Multiple regression is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that the use of RPE at the industry level is significantly related to industry discretion (i.e. the degree of latitude that managers have over strategic and operational choices in the particular industry environment) and industry homogeneity, but not to industry competition. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited in terms of a dated sample (necessary to be consistent with the Bannister and Newman paper). It would bear updating. In addition, multi-year panel data could be used to generate more robust results. It would also be useful to replicate the study in other national (and hence governance) contexts. Practical implications: The findings should help boards when deciding how to reward or punish CEOs and top managers for their firm performance by filtering out relative performance in a more rational manner (e.g. by taking relevant industry context into account). Originality/value: In terms of originality, this is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, that investigates RPE at the industry level. It is valuable because industry discretion is an important contextual variable that a board of directors will find useful in evaluating managers since this type of discretion is beyond managerial control.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

The main objective of this paper is to explore the role of family councils vis-a-vis corporate governance mechanisms. Particularly, the paper explores whether family councils perform only their distinctive family governance role or if they also substitute for the roles performed by corporate governance control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 243 Italian family SMEs, our research findings show that the family council partially substitutes the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors in playing their respective corporate governance roles of ownership and monitoring. These findings are interpreted in the light of both agency and relational perspectives. (c) 2013 International Council for Small Business.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other "LGBT-friendly" policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

In this study we examine the relationship between board diversity in terms of member background and personality (deep-level diversity) and board creativity and cognitive conflict, controlled for the mediating role of board members' interactions. Using a sample of 385 Norwegian companies, the results provide strong support for the notion that the higher the level of board diversity with respect to the board members' backgrounds and personalities, the higher the degree of board creativity and cognitive conflict during the decision-making process. Moreover, our empirical evidence supports the mediating role of interactions among board members. The study supports the increasing importance of going beyond "surface level diversity" (e.g., diversity in term of gender) and investigating characteristics that are less visible and that are labelled "deep-level" diversity attributes.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

Innovation is critical for nonprofit organizations' effective response to changing environmental conditions. While the board of directors, which has the ultimately responsibility for leadership and governance of nonprofit organizations, is in a position to facilitate the development of such capacity, theoretical and empirical literature on this link is very limited and originates primarily in developed world countries, limiting its generalizability and usefulness to other national contexts. The author of this article sought to contribute to the growing literature on boards and innovation by (1) discussing potential usefulness of a Western conceptual model--Board of directors and innovation in nonprofit organizations (Jaskyte, Human services as complex organizations, 2012)--to other contexts, more specifically those of developing countries and (2) providing preliminary empirical evidence for the links presented in the model from nonprofit organizations in developing countries. Five representatives of four social service nonprofit organizations in developing countries known for their continuous innovation were interviewed in order to gain some insights into the board's role in facilitating innovation. While limited, preliminary data provide support for the importance of board attribute and process variables for organization's capacity for continuous innovation, and suggest that considering cultural contexts when assessing usefulness of established models might be paramount.

Purpose - The financial crisis of 2008-2009 was truly global in nature that affected all sectors and countries of the world. Being considered that a board of directors is the main governance mechanism through which a company is governed and managed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the governance structure of a company on its financial performance during the period of financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates the effect of board structure parameters - board leadership, directors and board size on the financial performance for 164 non-financial listed firms in India during the period of financial crisis of 2008-2009. Findings - The study finds a significant positive effect with Chief Executive Officer duality, executive chairperson and proportion of inside directors on the firm's financial performance. Independent directors have no significant influence, while non-executive (grey) director's being affiliated with the firm has a negative influence on firm's financial performance. A larger board has a negative relationship with the firm's financial performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to large non-financial firms of the Bombay Stock Exchange-200 index. The study may be extended to include other firms to generalize the findings. Practical implications - Results imply that during the period of financial distress, a company having more inside (or management) directors with an executive chairperson are in a better position to manage company resources with positive impact on financial performance. Companies with larger boards may find it difficult to take quick decisions, which ultimately affect their performance. Originality/value - The study is original in its idea of assessing company strategy to adopt a suitable governance structure that can sustain its performance during the period of financial crisis.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

This study examines the relationship between ownership structure and performance of public firms in Mexico, considering debt and the structure of the board of directors as contextual and institutional factors. This research seeks to explain the mixed results about the relationship of ownership and performance presented by other relevant studies in family and non-family businesses, mainly in emerging countries. The results confirm the positive association between family ownership concentration and performance, calculated by Tobin's Q, showing how the participation of inside shareholders on the board and a low debt level contribute to higher performance. However, the association of these variables with performance shows a contrasting effect in the case of family as compared to non-family businesses. The particular corporate legal context in Mexico could be highlighted as one of the main reasons for these results. (c) 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Top management teams frequently overemphasize efforts to exploit the current product portfolio, even in the face of the strong need to step up exploration activities. This mismanagement of the balance between explorative R&D activities and exploitation of the current product portfolio can result in the so-called success trap, the situation where explorative activities are fully suppressed. The success trap constitutes a serious threat to the long-term viability of a firm. Recent studies of publicly traded corporations suggest that the suppression of exploration arises from the interplay among the executive team's myopic forces, the board of directors as gatekeeper of the capital market, and the exploitation-exploration investments and their outcomes. In this paper, system dynamics modeling serves to identify and test ways in which top management teams can counteract this suppression process. For instance, we find that when the executive board is suppressing exploration, the board of directors can still prevent the success trap by actively intervening in the exploitation-exploration strategy.

Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on individual directors' economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The discrepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board's dynamic, team task performance efficacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on firm profitability. Our findings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction - thereby lowering information asymmetry - have a significant impact on corporate profitability. Our study demonstrates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on profitability, while the focus on compliance-oriented tasks has a significantly negative effect on profitability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improving board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

This study seeks to contribute to the debate on board behavior by investigating how deeper-level diversity, specifically differences in personality, interacts with demographic diversity to explain board cognitive and affective conflict. Using survey data from a pilot study of 98 directors in 16 UK boards, we show that dissimilarities in personality traits are negatively related to cognitive conflict, but this relationship is moderated by gender and tenure diversity. Personality differences do not explain affective conflict. The study provides insights into how theories from psychology may help us understand antecedents to board behaviors.

Corporate governance significantly effects corporate performance and this relationship is established through number of studies theoretically and empirically conducted in this field. Also, there are studies which show the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital performance. Furthermore, intellectual capital performance positively effects corporate performance as shown in the previous studies. These relationships trigger this study to explore the role of intellectual capital as a mediator between corporate governance and corporate performance relationship. This study focuses on the idea that governance measures, board of directors in this study, can contribute to the intellectual capital efficiency of the companies which in turn results in higher corporate performance. A single structural model of corporate governance, intellectual capital and corporate performance is conceptualized. In the model, board of directors, variables are taken as governance measures, Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAICTM) as intellectual capital performance measure and traditional financial measures as corporate performance measures. It is intellectual capital resources which act as mechanism through which the corporate governance is able to influence the corporate performance. Intellectual capital is taken as mediator to confirm that IC properly mediates the CG and performance relationship conceptually. This study will be beneficial for the research community to combine different areas of study under one model. This study will suggest the management and other regulatory bodies to understand the importance of intellectual capital along with governance and performance.

The objective of this article is twofold: identify the primary board characteristics that drive the quality of MFI governance and link governance quality to microfinance institutions' outreach performance. We measure governance quality with the governance rating score provided by Planet Rating, one of the agencies that specialize in the rating of microfinance institutions. The study focuses on an independently pooled cross-section sample of 178 MFIs rated by Planet Rating from 2001 to 2011. Findings obtained after controlling for selection bias suggest that board expertise, board activity, and ownership type are the main board characteristics that significantly determine the quality of MFI governance. Findings seem to be robust when we change the measurement of board size and ownership type. Moreover, MFIs with an effective governance system tend to serve large numbers of customers.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Within corporate governance the accountability of the board of directors is identified as a major issue by governments, international bodies, professional associations and academic literature. Boards are given significant power in companies, and as a consequence it is argued that they should be accountable for their actions. Drawing on political science, public administration, accounting, and ethics literature, this book examines the concept of accountability and its meaning in the corporate governance context. It examines the rationale for making boards accountable, and outlines the obstacles and drawbacks involved in providing for accountability. The book goes on to examine how current mechanisms for ensuring accountability are assessed in terms of fairness, justice, transparency, practicality, effectiveness and efficiency, before discussing the ways that accountability might be improved. Andrew Keay argues that enhanced accountability can provide better corporate governance, helping to reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises, and improve confidence in company practice. As an in depth study of a key element within the exercise of authority and management in corporate entities, this book will be of great use and interest to researchers and students of corporate governance, business and management, and corporate social responsibility.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the moderating effects of a board of directors on foreign direct investment (FDI)'s international diversification in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of Turkish multinational firms with FDI was used. Two different aspects of international diversification were considered: the relationship between international diversification and financial performance and the moderating effect of board composition on the relationship between international diversification and the firm's financial performance. Firm-level data were obtained from the Istanbul Stock Exchange in Turkey. Findings: The findings reveal that international diversification leads to better financial performance according to market-based measures. On the other hand, this study indicates that the board characteristics have a moderating effect on international diversification and financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a sample of publicly listed firms in Turkey, and this restriction limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: The internalization efforts of Turkish FDI have led to better financial performance in terms of market-based measures. The results have stated that the interest of independent outside directors is aligned with lower-risk investment decisions. Independence of independent outside directors in Turkey is interrogated by practitioners or the Capital Markets Board of Turkey. The larger board size which a moderator variable is provided, the wider shareholder value in Turkey is. Social implications: One can understand that the development of market-supporting institutions provides the support for entry to an emerging economy which is inefficient or incomplete markets and highly concentrated family ownership. Originality/value: These findings provide important implications for corporate governance and highlight the need for further research on the role of governance in firm internationalization. This study not only helps to understand how board characteristics affect the choice of international diversification decisions, but the results also allow to assess the performance implications of these choices for a particular period.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine whether a firm's operating environment influences the likelihood that the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors. Specifically, using robust regression techniques, we find that when a firm has greater advisory needs and is more reliant on managerial initiatives for innovation, the firm is more likely to appoint its CEO as the chair. We also examine whether CEO-Chairs use their greater bargaining power from holding dual positions to benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders. We find no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs are more likely to extract rents compared to CEOs who are not chairs. Collectively, these findings indicate that the decision by firms to appoint their CEOs as chairs is determined by the firms' operating environment and that there is no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs use their power from holding dual positions to the detriment of shareholders.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

This research examines the relationship between the board of directors and firm's performance through the R&D investment-level in the French context from perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to identify if the R&D investment-level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the board size, and secondly, the performance. The empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationship between boards composition linked variables and the firm performance are meditated by the firm R&D investment-level.

This study analyzes the effect of directors' human and external social capital on the monitoring and resource provision tasks of the board. Furthermore, this study examines the moderating effect of cognitive and affective conflicts among the directors on these relationships. Based on a sample of 92 cases, we find that the human and external social capital of the directors is positively associated with board's monitoring and resource provision tasks. The results suggest that cognitive conflict positively moderates the relationship between directors' external social capital with the monitoring and negatively with the resource provision tasks. Affective conflict was found to moderate the relationship between directors' external social capital and the resource provision tasks negatively, and positively moderate the relationship between directors' human capital and resource provision tasks. This study suggests that the behavioral perspective, which takes into account the dynamics and interaction in the board, has considerable predictive power. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The compensation received by directors has attracted the interest on good corporate governance practices related to remuneration matters, with particular emphasis on the need to link the remuneration of directors and the business performance. However, the question remains whether this relationship is being implemented or, on the contrary, we must address through other measures that encourage directors' remunerations more in line with the shareholders' interests. The analysis of a sample of 76 Spanish firms over the period 2004-2009 shows the existence of this relationship if book based indicators are taken as a reference. However, this relation does not exist with those indicators made according to market data. These results should make researchers and regulators think about the need for new ways of remuneration that convey confidence to compensation systems. (c) Virtus interpress 2015.

Classical economic theories establishing a relationship between CEO remuneration and firm performance has paid particular attention to solve conflict of interest between managerial team and firm shareholders, by designing an optimum CEO remuneration that motivate executives to work in the best interest of shareholders. Many international and less Australian empirical researches suggest that there is overwhelming evidence that firm performance is strongly linked with CEO remuneration. In this paper, we reassess the association of firm performance and CEO remuneration variables using dynamic econometric models and comprehensive data from Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We find a positive and strong association between CEO pay of top 200 Australian public listed companies and company performance. Obtained findings are similar to USA, UK and Canada studies results. We further test the effect of board and ownership features on CEO remuneration-performance sensitivity in the top 200 Australian public companies listed on ASX. Specifically, for the period of 2003-2007, our results highlight the importance of ownership structure in influencing remuneration-performance relationship. Monitoring block holders boost the responsiveness of long term incentives (LTI) remuneration to performance, thus straightening shareholder and manager welfares. However, based on a short term investment horizon strategy, insider block holders increase (decrease) the sensitivity of short-term incentives remuneration (long term incentives pay). Surprisingly, for the period 2008-2013, our findings suggest that ownership and board features did not influence significantly CEO pay-performance sensitivities. Finally, we find that larger boards increase (decrease) the responsiveness of CEO's known remuneration (long term incentives) to performance. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The funding of defined-benefit plans has garnered the attention of academicians, practitioners, and policymakers. Drawing upon agency and organizational control theories, this study investigates the implications of board independence on changes in defined-benefit funding. Using a panel dataset of S&P 500 companies sponsoring defined-benefit plans, the author finds that corporate boards matter. Specifically, CEO duality and outside director representation are associated with year-to-year decreases in defined-benefit funding. Conversely, outside director ownership is related to year-to-year increases in defined-benefit funding. Furthermore, outside director ownership moderated the relationship between outside director representation and defined-benefit funding such that outside director representation is associated with year-to-year increases in defined-benefit plan funding when the percentage of outside director ownership is high.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While US companies mainly list their board of directors alphabetically, this is not the case for Chinese companies, most of which list their independent directors last. We interpret the listing order of Chinese directors as board hierarchy, reflecting power allocation within the board. Based on extant evidence that independent directors contribute to firm value and that empowered individuals have more influence in group decision making, we expect independent-director rankings to be positively associated with firm value and find evidence consistent with this prediction. In our supplementary analyses we explore the mechanisms through which empowered independent directors enhance firm value. We find that independent directors who are ranked higher are more likely to vote against the management, especially on financial reporting issues. Further, higher independent-director rankings are associated with less earnings management. Our study suggests that empowering independent directors increases firm value. (c) 2016

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

This study examines how firms use benchmarking information about peers to determine the compensation that they offer to chief executive officers (CEOs). It jointly addresses two distinct perspectives: pay equity and managerial power. Pay inequity provides strong motivation for CEOs to restore equity, by promoting the logic of external fairness and urging boards of directors to implement peer benchmarking and adjust the focal CEO's compensation levels. Although pay inequity may motivate CEOs to restore equity, their reaction to inequity may be effective only when they have sufficient power over the board of directors to influence the pay-setting process. Results from a sample of 1,555 CEOs generally support predictions about the moderating effects of CEO power in the relationship between a focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay. The compensation for underpaid CEOs with relatively greater power over the board is associated with their peers' compensation, suggesting that peer benchmarking is more aggressively used to adjust CEO compensation upward. For overpaid CEOs, the relationship between the focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay is weaker when the CEOs have greater influence over the board, suggesting that such CEOs are able to avoid the use of benchmarking and downward adjustments of pay.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' composition (independent directors' ratio, board size, CEO-duality) and financial transparency and disclosure (T&D). Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes board composition and financial T&D of Italian listed companies using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The results of this paper show a significant link between board composition and the level of financial T&D. In particular, the authors found a positive and significant relationship between the independent directors' ratio and the level of financial T&D and a negative relationship between board size and the level of financial T&D. Research limitations/implications: While this paper focuses on a sample of 100 Italian listed companies, the authors acknowledge the importance of extending the results to other national context and to other type of firms (e.g. non-listed firms or SMEs). Moreover, while this paper concerns the amount of information disclosed by firms, it does not look at the quality or accuracy of disclosure. Practical implications: This paper reveals the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms (such as board composition) in enhancing the level of financial T&D. Indeed, the authors provide some indications to firms to improve their internal governance mechanisms (e.g. the importance of high proportion of independent directors and of small- and medium-sized boards of directors). Originality/value: This paper provides interesting insights to firms which are under pressure to improve the level of information to stakeholders. Moreover, has the level of information that is not legally required vary among companies and countries, the authors shed light on a context characterized by high level of ownership concentration, where firms can experience different types of conflict of interests.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

We study the effect of board size on firm value in Australia. Using a large sample of Australian firms over the period 2001-2011, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship. We show that firms with a large board are associated with CEO compensation that is sensitive to firm size, but not to firm performance. This incentive to accumulate assets is congruent with the fact that firms with a large board also exhibit lower operating performance and higher operating costs. Furthermore, we find that the effect of board size is stronger in small firms. This result might explain why earlier studies, which focused on large Australian firms, found board size to have little impact on firm value. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study examines the role of the top management team (TMT) and governance structures in the use of corporate venture capital (CVC) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO). The study is unique in that it sheds light on governance-related antecedents of strategic decision making in such firms. We integrate the insights of behavioral agency and upper echelon perspectives to develop our hypotheses. Our results show that in the presence of non-duality, a negative curvilinear relationship exists between TMT heterogeneity and the use of CVC. We also find that TMT heterogeneity and ownership motivate the use of CVC but only up to a certain threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures of entrepreneurship and strategy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

Grounded in the strategic leadership literature and upper echelons theory, this study proposes that founder CEOs tend to take more risks than agent CEOs because of the former's overconfidence. We further suggest that the relationship between founder CEO status and firm risk taking can be moderated by certain internal or external factors that influence just how overconfident a CEO might be. Our theoretical predictions are well supported by a large survey data set on Chinese CEOs. Specifically, the positive relationship between founder CEO status and firm risk taking weakens when the CEO is younger, when the CEO also chairs the board of directors, and when the CEO's task environment is less uncertain, less complex, and more munificent.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to account for the internationalization of restaurants. The conceptual framework of upper echelons theory is applied to identify the demographic determinants of internationalization among chief executive officers (CEOs). Design/methodology/approach: Data from 30 restaurant firms for the period 1999-2013 were collected from a variety of sources, primarily Compustat and Execucomp, based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 5812, the annual 10-K and public information. A panel feasible generalized least squares model was used as the main instrument of analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that the CEO gender and share ownership negatively affect the internationalization of restaurant companies, whereas size, the extent of franchising, the type of restaurant and stock options positively affect the degree of internationalization. Additionally, an inverted U-shaped relation exists between CEO tenure and the degree of internationalization. Practical implications: The presented information may provide shareholders and boards of directors with valuable guidelines regarding the assignment of appropriate managers depending on the extent to which their companies are pursuing internationalization strategies. Originality/value: Most studies in hospitality sectors have focused only on accounting-based measures to explain strategic decision-making, although proponents of upper echelons theory have argued that CEO attributes influence strategic decisions/changes. This study contributes to the literature on hospitality by identifying the effects of CEO characteristics on internationalization decisions. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance issues are critical in university spin-offs because, since their substantially knowledge and technology-driven nature, investments are characterized by rapid growth and real investment opportunities, affecting innovative activity too. In this view, the paper investigate the role of the board of directors' composition on innovation performance of university spin-offs. Based on a panel sample of 478 Italian university spin-offs, the results show that board size has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with innovation, remarking that not too large boards are more efficient and work better, influencing in a positive way the innovation activity of the spin-off. Regarding the impact of the outside directors, the results seems to invalidate its positive and significant effect on innovation performance. Also the CEO-duality seems to have no influence on the innovative activity. These findings may represent potential indicators of the optimal configuration for board in university spin-offs in order to improve innovation.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

This paper assesses Andrew Pettigrew's contribution to management scholarship. This review addresses the process, content, and context of his research career. Chronologically, the process will be subdivided into three distinct phases: the period leading up to the establishment of the Centre for Corporate Strategy and Change, Pettigrew's time with the Centre, and Pettigrew's research since leaving the Centre. The content of Pettigrew's research focussed on big problems and emerging phenomena such as decision-making, organisational culture, organisation development, strategic change, human resource management, competitiveness, new public management, boards of directors, innovative forms of organising, high-performing research teams, and business schools. His contextualist methodology for process research will be explicated. Pettigrew's contribution will be contextualised by comparing it with contemporary research. The paper concludes that there is still a need not only to examine big problems and emerging phenomena but also to provide a processual understanding of management reality. There is a need to further develop process research methodologies such as Pettigrew's contextualism, especially with respect to process research methods.

This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and 'increased career risks' perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country's culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

This paper investigates the link between the board composition and the corporate diversification decisions of 50 large UK listed corporations over the period from 2005 to 2015. The panel data analysis integrates changes in board composition and its dynamic effect on the extent of diversification. We find that increased board independence influences the extent of both unrelated and related diversification. Neither institutional representatives nor extra-industry interlocking directors influence the extent of diversification in ways which promote shareholders' interests. The findings support corporate governance policy promoting board independence. In contrast, these findings suggest extending the involvement of institutional investors to board representation may not mitigate agency problems in large companies.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

The current study examines the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on corporate financial performance (CFP). Prior studies document a positive CSR-CFP association without considering the moderating effects of chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics such as compensation incentives and tenure. Our results show evidence of a positive association between CSR and CFP only in the firms managed by short-tenured, high-cash paid CEOs and particularly during an industry's cooling-off period. The results imply that the incentives embedded in the current CEO pay are not effective and CEOs use CSR as a compensation management tool to increase their share-based pay. To encourage a CEO to implement CSR engagement, particularly during an industry's boom period, the board of directors should decrease common-share payments and increase the CEO's option payments. In addition, the proportion of cash compensation in the CEO's total compensation should not be reduced. (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines the degree to which senior executive members of a school's decision-making team (senior management team and board of directors) are aligned on fundamental principles of school strategy. Our study is based on a conceptual framework of strategic leadership as it applies in an Australian independent school context. We also examine the differences between the senior management team and board of directors based on top management team (TMT) tenure heterogeneity, and how these differences account for TMT associations with school strategy. Implications for research and practice complete the study. The terms top management team, senior management team, and senior leadership team are used interchangeably in this article.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the non-financial causes of organizational success or failure, provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes exploratory case studies in investigating the relationship of non-financial factors to organizational success or failure across a sample of sector-specific Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. A two-tailed study was designed, in which seven cases from both extremes were chosen from three Australian business sectors: finance, property and manufacturing. Findings - Non-financial factors associated with the organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included management skill, experience and involvement in organizational strategy, feedback and resultant activity, together with board of director composition. The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes could be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure. Research limitations/implications - The use of this method is very time-consuming but is highly valuable in case study research, providing a more in-depth understanding of how non-financial factors impact organizational success or failure. Practical implications - The research will provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. The improvement in prediction of organizational failure will reduce the costs of failure to all areas affected, from the large corporation to the small business. The inter-connectivity of all businesses to each other often results in a knock-on effect of failure with the cost being borne by all members of the community in some manner. The level of social impact and cost of failure can only be seen by the enormous costs of the Global Financial Crisis failures. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on effective qualitative research and explores important areas of consideration for those conducting qualitative multiple-case studies. It is intended to be of use to researchers investigating the area of predictors of organizational failure or success. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by the board of directors. Yet while much research explores how firm performance, governance structures, and types of succession affect the appointment decision, we have less understanding of the influence of contextual factors such as external constituents. This paper is the first to explore how one key constituent -investment analysts -may shape the appointment decision, specifically through serving as an information intermediary for the board. Because CEO succession creates uncertainty regarding the firm's future leadership and its strategic direction, I propose that investment analysts, as knowledgeable experts who provide research coverage on the firm, provide the board with information that is likely to influence their selection of a new CEO. In addition, I argue that because analysts are recognized as having expertise regarding the future performance of the firm, the board is likely to select a CEO in order to appease these critical stakeholders. Using panel data on S & P 500 companies for the 2000-2005 periods, I find evidence that analyst recommendations convey information about a firm's top management and the appropriateness of its strategy that is reflected in the appointment decision. Specifically, I find that more negative analyst ratings lead to a higher probability that the board will appoint an outsider CEO and also make the board more likely to appoint a high status CEO.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

Despite knowing the potential effect of social reporting on firms' continuity, there is limited research into the influence of the composition of boards of directors on CSR disclosure. This paper adds to the emerging CSR literature empirical evidence by examining how board composition relates to a firm's social and environmental disclosure as well as the implementation of social policies. Using a sample of FTSE 350 firms for the period 2007-2012, the results show that higher board independence facilitates the conveying of firms' good citizenship image through enhancing societal conscience. The results also show that female participation on boards is favorably affecting CSR engagement and reporting as well as the establishment of ethical policies. Hence, the research suggests that boards with higher female participation and independence boost the legitimacy of CSR reporting.

This paper investigates whether female independent directors are more likely to impose high dividend payouts. We find evidence that firms with a larger fraction of female directors on their board have greater dividend payouts. This finding is robust to alternative econometric specifications, and alternative measures of dividend payouts and female board representation. The positive effect of board gender composition on dividends remains when we employ propensity score matching, the instrumental variable approach, and difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that board gender composition significantly increases the dividend payout only for firms with weak governance, suggesting that female directors use dividend payouts as a governance device.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the state of S&P 500 companies' transparency by analyzing their Bloomberg ESG (Environmental-Social-Governance) disclosure scores. Additionally, the effects of industry sector, firm size, and governance practices on transparency are examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data were retrieved from Bloomberg using the financial analysis environmental, social and governance function for companies comprising the S&P 500 index. Descriptive statistics are provided on each of the three components separately (ESG). Nonparametric procedures are used to test for significant differences in transparency within each of these three areas based on industry sector. Additionally, nonparametric tests are used to determine the impact of firm size (market capitalization) and governance factors (board size, board gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, and linking executive compensation to ESG disclosure) on the composite ESG score. Findings: Descriptive statistics reveal that S&P 500 companies differ in their level of disclosure across the three areas (ESG). The highest level of transparency is found on Governance and the lowest on Environmental. Moreover, there is much variability in the percentage of S&P 500 companies disclosing information about specific Social policies (e.g. child labor). Significant differences in transparency on both the Social and Governance dimensions are found between certain industry sectors. The results also reveal that large-cap companies have significantly higher ESG disclosure scores than mid-cap companies and that governance factors impact ESG disclosure. Significantly, higher ESG disclosure scores are observed for S&P 500 firms with larger boards of directors, with boards that are more gender diverse, that allow CEO duality, and that link executive compensation to ESG scores. Originality/value: This study focuses on corporate transparency through a granular analysis of ESG disclosure scores when most other studies have been primarily conducted at the macro level. Stakeholders, analysts, and shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing firms' sustainability disclosures in their assessment of management quality, as it reflects on the practices/policies that are employed to improve firms' environmental and social footprints.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Purpose: This study is guided by the upper echelon theory and argues that the role of females on boards of directors may differ between cultures. In a culture where the community has a significant humane orientation, female directors may pay much more attention to the social issues of corporate sustainability rather than environmental issues. Therefore, this study aims to differentiate between the social and environmental performances of companies to examine whether the presence of females on the boards of directors of Malaysian firms could affect social and environmental performances differently. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of firms listed in Bursa Malaysia and develops two disclosure indices to measure social and environmental performances. Three proxies of female directors are used in the empirical models. The ordinary least square model is used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The empirical results suggest a positive association between social performance and the presence of female directors on the board of directors of Malaysian firms. However, no association was found between environmental performance and the presence of female directors on those boards. These results confirm the prediction of this study that the female directors of Malaysian firms pay more attention to social issues than to environmental ones. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the effects of the presence of female directors on Malaysian firms' boards of directors on social and environmental performance. It also contributes to the upper echelon theory by illuminating the importance of gender diversity in influencing the social and environmental behaviors of corporate leaders. The results provide the important implication that the association between a firm's social and environmental performance and gender diversity depends on the culture within which the company operates.

Prior research on post-acquisition performance suggests positive, negative, or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms. Grounding our arguments on the extended resource-based view, the current article proposes that business group-affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long-term acquisition performance, relative to standalone firms, especially in emerging economies such as India. Additionally, we hypothesize that both within-group heterogeneity, manifested as prior group experience, group diversification, and intra-group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors, also affect the long-term post-acquisition performance of affiliated firms. The findings, obtained with a buy-and-hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions, both domestic and cross-border, by Indian firms during 2005-2013, provide robust support for the theoretical arguments.

The concept of greed is one of the oldest social constructs; however, greed as a managerial attribute that affects firm outcomes has yet to attract scholarly attention in management. In this study, we examine the relationship of CEO greed to shareholder wealth. After anchoring greed to familiar constructs in organizational literature, we test our hypotheses on a sample of over 300 publicly traded firms from multiple industries. As predicted, greed has a negative relationship with shareholder return, but this relationship is moderated by the presence of a powerful, independent board, managerial discretion, and CEO tenure. The contributions of this study, which include refining our understanding of self-interest and opportunism, developing the greed construct, and illustrating its impact on shareholder wealth, are intended to open a new line of inquiry in the management literature.

Research summary: This study examines the relationship between an independent director's death and CEO acquisitiveness. Using a sample of large U.S. public firms, we find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death undertake fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of posttraumatic growth theory that mortality awareness can induce CEOs to reevaluate their life priorities and reduce the importance of extrinsic goals in their decision making. This study contributes to the strategic leadership literature by highlighting the influence of the death of CEOs' social peers on CEOs' strategic decisions. Managerial summary: Does the death of CEOs' social peers influence CEOs' strategic decisions? We find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death engage in fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. One likely explanation for our findings is that the death of an independent director may heighten CEOs' mortality awareness, lead the CEOs to pursue a quieter life, and weaken their propensities for undertaking decisions (i.e., acquisitions) that increase their compensation and social status.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the association between board demographics and firm financial performance of Karachi Stock Exchange companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The connection between board structure and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the relationship between board structure and the performance of Pakistani public listed companies by using a sample of Karachi Stock Exchange 100 (KSE-100) indexed companies. This study exploits the corporate performance by accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q), and economic profit (economic value added). Findings: The outcome of the study shows the positive relationship between the board size, minority representation in board, and family director's in-board and firm performance. The authors also find that, instead of adding value, independent directors in Pakistan are negatively associated with firm value. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on KSE-100 indexed companies from 2009 to 2013; however, a large sample and multiple years' data are required. Practical implications: The paper provides empirical evidence that board independence is not necessary for public-listed companies in Pakistan and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance and firm performance by introducing a framework for identifying and analyzing moderating variables that affect the relationship between board structure and firm performance.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The role of the nomination committee (NC) in the selection of members of various ethnic groups for board membership has increased significantly as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008. A company board that comprises directors who come from all the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian Malaysians) increases the efficiency of the board in its monitoring and advising roles. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012), the NC shall be responsible for the appointment and recognition of candidates of diverse backgrounds into the board and committee. With that in mind, this paper examines the presence of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors in a nomination committee and its impact on the ethnic diversity of its board. This paper also examines the influence of the executive directors who are members in the nomination committee on the nomination process. For this purpose, 393 (50%) Malaysian listed companies were selected from the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Only non-financial companies were included because other companies such as finance have a different set of regulations in Malaysia. In this study, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression were used for the purpose of revealing important significance of the variables used. In order to control possible endogeneity issues, the GMM estimator was also administered. The regression results of the ethnic diversity model are statistically significant, showing that, a higher proportion of Malay and Chinese directors in a nomination committee has negative relationships while a higher proportion of Indian directors in a nomination committee increases their representation on the board. However, the proportion of executive directors in the nomination committee was found to have a significant impact on the director nomination process of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors. In order to test the robustness of the model, several sets of measures were used. In conclusion, it is deduced that the results of this study support the social identity theory and power struggle, it shows the importance of diversity within the nominating committee of Malaysian companies. The result also reveals that unbiased and effective board mix enhances the strategic decision-making process of the board.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

A wealth of governance research has examined CEO successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. Despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. In this article, we investigate whether disruptive CEO successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. We focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. We leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are--in practice--viewed as normative violations. We theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim CEOs and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. However, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise CEO departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board's decision to rely on an interim CEO. Our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded U.S. firms provides support for these arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study relates a firm's cash holdings and their value to the board of directors' level of education. Using a sample of firms on the Taiwan Stock Exchange during the period from 2006 to 2012, we find that firms with a highly educated board tend to hold more cash and are associated with a higher value of cash. This fact is especially evident among financially constrained firms. Our findings suggest that highly educated boards provide more efficient monitoring and advisory functions, and thus complement corporate governance.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

This study applies a new multi-focal actor-centered institution-theoretic approach to examine the association between executive pay and the recruitment of social elites to the board of directors in developing countries. We use a sample of 119 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 17 African stock markets to model this relationship. The results suggest that a higher proportion of elites on the board is associated with lower executive pay. This is moderated by institutional quality; that is, lower institutional quality is associated with more directors drawn from social elites and with higher pay, while the opposite is true in higher-institutional-quality environments. Our findings confirm the importance of the social environment within which governance is embedded. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO's dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-a-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO-TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO's delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors.

There is limited research based on the perspective of neo-institutional that examines the cognitive pressures related to green management practices. The current study examined the relationship between the past environmental related experiences which one of the cognitive dimensions of leader in public listed company and its relationship with positive deviance behaviour in green management practices. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between the past environmental related experiences of the board of directors and positive deviance behaviour in green management practices; however for CEO's past environmental related experiences and its interaction effect with board of director's past environmental experiences are otherwise. This study reveals that the understanding regarding the intersection between sound corporate governance and green management practices is very important in companies deviating positively in green management practices.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

We investigate the internal workings of US corporate governance with a hand-collected dataset of director resignations that are related to power struggles within the board. About two-thirds of the conflicts arise because of how board members interact in carrying out their duties, while most of the remaining cases involve disagreements between directors and top management over corporate strategy or financial policy. Conflicts are more likely to occur at companies where the CEO is the founder or is relatively new to the position. Tensions also increase when there are independent directors with large blockholdings. Stock prices decline sharply on average after a director turnover amid dispute, which may indicate that investors expect the firm to continue to have poor operating performance. The aftermath of such a resignation often includes shareholder class-action lawsuits, proxy contests, asset divestitures, and stock market delistings. Our results highlight the importance of a well-functioning board for reducing agency problems and maximizing shareholder value. (c) 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

This study aims to analyze the effect of gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, as well as the effect of education background of the President Commissioner on the firm value. Gender diversity is measured from the proportion of women in Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, while the education background is measured by the education background of the President Commissioner. In this research, the firm value is measured by Tobins Q. The sample used in this study consist of 70 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange in the year 2012. This study employs multiple linear regression to draw the research results. The analysis results show that gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors significantly affects firm value. On the contrary, the education background of the President Commissioner does not affect firm value. This result support the argument that diversity of boards will, through various ways, affect firm financial value in the long and short term.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research has confirmed private firm performance as a predictor of executive turnover, but whether this relationship holds in other organizational contexts--especially those operating without a profit-distribution requirement--is not known. For nonprofit organizations, performance monitoring and governance largely occur behind closed doors under the leadership of a volunteer board of directors. Nonprofits are commonly criticized as inefficient, even ineffective, and the accountability of boards and executives for organizational performance has not been sufficiently investigated. This article engages a unique dataset of 998 U.S.-based nonprofits serving missions related to the arts, health, and human services, and uses a multiple-spell discrete-time hazard model to evaluate nonprofit financial performance and the likelihood of executive turnover. The findings provide preliminary support that tenure in the executive office is sensitive to nonprofit financial performance, and in doing so, they raise new insights about the accountability of nonprofit executives.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how information-processing mechanisms between nominating committees (NCs), incumbent executives, board chairs, and shareholders affect the comprehensiveness of executive succession processes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an explanatory multiple-case study that comprises eight CEO and CFO succession cases in large German publicly traded firms. Findings: The findings reveal that comprehensiveness is determined by four key information-processing mechanisms: the effectiveness of NC's information sharing, absorbing disagreement, and integrating heterogeneous opinions; board chair leadership (i.e. an apprentice board leadership structure in association with the board chair's openness to ideas); the breadth and depth of information sharing between executives and NCs; and the extent and timing to which major shareholders influence succession processes. Research limitations/implications: The authors summarize the findings in a conceptual framework and develop a set of propositions to guide future research on the topic. Such studies may want to test the suggestions in a quantitative way, preferably in a multinational context. Originality/value: The authors' emerging conceptual framework contributes a set of information-processing variables by which NCs engage in comprehensive executive successions with incumbent executives, board chairs, and major shareholders and offers a multiechelon approach to study executive successions.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the effects of competing influences emanating from firms' social structural context (i.e. sent and received board of director interlocks and industry peers) on the adoption of an institutionally contested corporate governance code provision. Design/methodology/approach: The corporate governance code provision of interest in this research recommends that German firms listed on German stock exchanges should disclose the individual remuneration arrangements for their board members. This paper uses 945 firm year observations from 2002 to 2006, the time period during which the adoption of this provision was voluntary for firms, to examine the role of firms' social structural context in the legitimization process of this provision. Findings: The results show that sent board interlocks to firms that defy pressures to adopt this practice have an equally pronounced but opposing effect on its institutionalization process. Received interlocks are inconsequential in this process. The results also provide evidence for the existence of competing influences emanating from firms' industry peers. In contrast to the effects associated with sent board interlocks, at the industry level, peer acquiescence has a more pronounced effect than peer defiance. Furthermore, the practice's legitimacy among firms' peers moderates the effects of sent board interlocks. Originality/value: The results of this paper suggest that a balanced approach to studying institutional change in corporate governance needs to acknowledge the co-existence of conflicting signals regarding the spread of new institutional models. The findings suggest that firms' social structural context plays a central role in processes of contested institutional change. Board interlocks and industry peers carry the potential to facilitate institutional change and facilitate institutional continuity and resistance to change. However, not all board interlocks are of equal importance, and industry peers constitute a source of legitimacy to which directors forming the interlocks attend.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between Board of Director characteristics and CEO compensation. This is semi-empirical study and statistical sample of research was based on 95 companies listed on the Tehran stock exchange from 2010 to 2014. Variables examined include the ratio of non-executive board members, CEO duality, ownership of institutional shareholders and managerial ownership as independent variables. Factors influencing CEO compensation were considered and the relationship between these variables was studied using multivariate regression. The findings indicate that there is a negative relationship between CEO compensation and managerial ownership. There is also a significant positive relationship between CEO compensation and CEO duality. However, there was no evidence for a significant relationship between ratios of non-executive board members and CEO compensation.

This chapter examines the role of governance as a determining factor of foreign investors' decisions as for investing in Tunisian listed family firms. To achieve this goal, first, two distinct forms of family involvement in firms are studied: family ownership and family management. In addition, this research assesses the role of various indicators of family firm governance on foreign investors' decision to invest in Tunisian listed family firms: board of directors' independence, the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder and CEO duality. A sample of 27 firms listed in the Tunis stock exchange from 2007 to 2014 has been used. It is found, on the one hand, that foreign investors seem to avoid investing in firms with high family ownership as well as in those where the family is involved in management; on the other hand, the board of directors' characteristics as well as the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder do not affect the decisions of foreign investors in Tunisia.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

The Livedoor-Fuji TV takeover battle for Nippon Broadcasting Systems is considered one of the greatest uproars in the corporate takeover in the history of Japan. The epic battle is believed to have its lasting impact on the basic institutions that govern the country's takeover market. The paper aims to investigate the institutional changes, if any, Japan has experienced following the Livedoor episode. Analysing a handful number of takeover attempts before and after the battle, the paper finds that although some surface changes can be observed, a broad-based change is yet to be seen. This can be attributed to the informal institutions which have long been recognised as fundamental building blocks of the national model of corporate governance in Japan.

A key issue when assessing a board of directors' composition is defining the profile of directors' desirable competences. This study follows competence theory to analyze the role of individual competences of board directors. We aim to answer the following questions: which are the required competences of board directors in non-listed companies, and what characteristics might lead to poor individual performance and adversely affect a board's overall performance. To investigate these questions, a grounded theory-based study was conducted involving interviews with twelve board directors who had at least five years of experience as directors and extensive careers as top management executives. Results of the study led to a theoretical model which identifies a set of behavioral competences that add to previous studies on this subject. (c) RAE.

In this paper we integrate the literature on decision quality with considerations specific to boards of directors. In order to maximize the value of their decisions, boards of directors must look beyond their legal obligations and incorporate business ethics and the latest developments in social, scientific and managerial learning on governance and decision-making processes. Organizations will benefit from identifying an internal staff member who can fill the role of Decision Quality Officer ("DQO") to advise the board on decision quality on an ongoing basis. We summarize some of the factors affecting board decisions, and explain the benefit of designating a DQO. Finally, we propose topics for a board policy on the role of a DQO.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We show evidence that female board representation is associated with greater innovative success, and thus enhances firm performance in innovation-intensive industries. Firms with female directors tend to invest more in innovation and obtain more patents and citations for given R&D expenditures. An increase of 10 percentage points in the tenure-weighted fraction of female directors is associated with approximately 6% more patents and 7% more citations. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, the positive association between female board representation and corporate innovation is stronger when product market competition is lower and when managers are more entrenched, consistent with increased monitoring by female directors improving managers' incentives to innovate. Furthermore, we find that female board representation is positively associated with performance only for firms for which innovation and creativity play a particularly important role.

Do women board directors change how companies do business? Firms face growing pressure to appoint more women to their boards of directors, yet little is known about the factors that enable female directors to impact their organizations. This study analyzes the representational thresholds that facilitate women's leadership in the area of corporate social responsibility. We test the predictions of token theory and critical mass theory to evaluate the ability of women to impact firm outcomes based on their numerical representation on the board of directors. Our analysis focuses on board composition and organizational outcomes in the Fortune 500 from 2001 to 2010. Our findings challenge the theoretical assumptions that solo and token women are unable to exert significant influence over their organizations, and underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Firms' boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Despite the growing interest in leaders' role in the turnaround process, there is a paucity of research on founder-CEOs' role in achieving successful turnaround among declining firms. In this study, using insights from the organizational identification literature, we argue that founder-CEOs play an important role in turnaround attempts due to their strong organizational commitment and psychological attachment to the declining firm as well as the relative absence of agency problem issues common among their non-founder counterparts. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from a matched pair sample of 142 US firms that experienced performance decline, we found that founder-CEO leadership significantly increases turnaround success in declining firms. We also found that, among turnaround firms, those led by founder-CEOs tend to put more emphasis on market-based turnaround strategies, such as new product introductions, and less emphasis on retrenchment actions, such as divestments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings contribute to corporate turnaround research by providing a more nuanced view of leaders' role in the turnaround process by specifically exploring the effect of founder CEO leadership. Furthermore, this study contributes to the turnaround literature by highlighting the strategic choices of founder-CEO-led firms and how these choices influence successful turnaround. Finally, by introducing organizational identification perspective, this study provides additional theoretical explanation of leadership antecedents of successful turnarounds. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings of this study suggest that boards of directors, shareholders, and consultants who often participate in turnaround management should carefully consider retaining founder-CEOs and endorsing their leadership during the turnaround process. Further, the findings provide turnaround specialists and other stakeholders with further understanding of not only the importance of product market strategies in the turnaround process but also founder-CEOs' role in fostering such strategies.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

While prior board of director studies have considered the role of director occupational expertise in areas such as law and finance on the strategic actions of the firm, little consideration has been given to understanding the value that human resource expertise on boards of directors, or board HR expertise, can provide. Drawing upon agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates the relationship between board HR expertise and the extent to which firms engage in diversity management. Furthermore, the moderating role of two organizational context factors--capital intensity and firm age--are considered, as these can highlight the degree to which firms strategically depend upon human capital. With a sample of 423 U.S. firms listed on the S&P 500 from 2002 to 2006, the findings indicate that firms with board HR expertise have stronger diversity management in comparison to firms lacking board HR expertise. Moreover, the positive effects of board HR expertise on diversity management decreases when firms' capital intensity or age rises. This highlights the value that HR practitioners can provide in serving on boards of directors, and suggests that the magnitude of board HR experts' influence hinges upon the firm's level of strategic dependence on human capital.

Upper echelons (UE) theory posits that organisational performance reflects the personal values and cognitive frames of the top management team (TMT) and, crucially, that greater heterogeneity in individual backgrounds of senior executives leads to better outcomes. However, often missing from this research is a more developed account of how this relationship between the characteristics of TMTs and performance is also mediated by internal conditions within organisations. In this paper we begin to address this deficiency focusing on the mediating impact of employee satisfaction and the styles and practices of line managers. Looking at the empirical case of English National Health Services acute care hospital trusts, we use a multiple mediation model to analyse the relationship between board heterogeneity, performance and these two (internal) organisational factors. A variance-based structural equation modelling approach (partial least square) is applied to a sample of 102 boards of directors. First, the results lend support to the UE hypothesis that there is a positive impact of board heterogeneity and hos-pital-level performance. Second, the analysis shows that the relationship heterogeneity-performance is positively influenced by: (a) the styles and practices of line managers; (b) the levels of staff satisfaction; and by their mutually reinforcing roles.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While prior research demonstrates the strategic human resource (HR) advantages associated with offering work-family benefits (WFBs), firms continue to be reluctant in providing their employees with these benefits. Drawing on the corporate governance and stakeholder orientation literatures, this study examines the role of board independence and capital for WFBs being offered in publicly-traded firms. Our results demonstrate that various director independence and capital attributes are related to the firm offering WFBs. Specifically, board directors who are outsiders, women, and holders of additional directorships, with their broad stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of WFBs being offered by the firm [Correction added on December 14, 2017, after first online publication: the preceding sentence has been updated to clarify the findings of the study.]. These findings are of importance to HR practitioners considering the influence that corporate boards can have on the firm's use of HR practices, such as WFBs, that affect all employees, not just the executives.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Gender diversity in family firms is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars across several fields. Despite this, there are few literature reviews that synthesize these research streams in the context of family businesses. To fill this gap, we examined the literature on gender diversity on the boards of family businesses by providing some insights into how the typical traits of family firms' boards interact with the diversity effects linked to the presence of women. This analysis is the starting point for identifying possible research areas not yet addressed by scholars, and therefore defining the research agenda on the subject. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

The aim of the present work is to examine corporate directors' boardroom interactions associated with conflicts as well as creativity and innovation phenomena. In line with the behavioral perspective in research on boards, we investigate relationships between task conflicts, an emerging creative and innovative boardroom climate as well as directors' work behaviors. Drawing upon the survey data from 423 corporate directors, we tested hypothesized relationships by the means of the structural equation modelling technique. The results provide evidence suggesting that task-related conflicts among corporate directors appear to be equally detrimental for the psychological workgroup climate as they are advantageous for initiating creative and innovative work behaviours. In other words, the positive effect of task conflicts on directors' creative and innovative work behaviours occurs so long as such conflicts do not simultaneously impair their perception of the creative/innovative boardroom environment. By integrating the literature on workplace group conflicts, creativity and innovation with the corporate governance writings, this study offers a new insight into corporate directors functioning. Presented findings have clear implications for future board research and managerial practice. (c) 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The present research has been undertaken to study the role of ownership type and board mechanisms in moderating the executive pay-corporate performance linkage in the Indian context. A sample of 209 companies listed on the S&P BSE 500 Index has been studied over the period 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Rigorous statistical analysis of the panel data highlights that some of the governance mechanisms are, in practice, instrumental in improving the relationship between pay and performance. Whereas efforts must, indeed, be channelled towards the better functioning of certain other internal control mechanisms. Specifically, of noteworthy consequence is the difference in the way the shareholders and the board of directors ameliorate the pay-performance relationship with respect to accounting vis-a-vis market-based corporate performance. Further, the weak monitoring role discharged by the institutional investors warrant immediate policy concern. The study brings forth important implications for practitioners and policy makers in designing corporate performance-based pay keeping in view the predominant influence exerted by the institutional environment of the emerging economy of India.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine operational and stock performance changes around forced CEO turnovers caused by conflicts between corporate boards and CEOs over the strategic direction of the firm. In addition, the authors investigate whether changes in performance can be explained by board, CEO, or firm characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply propensity score matching to choose matching firms that do not forced CEO turnover but have similar characteristics with the sample firms. The authors compare their operating and stock performances. The authors apply both univariate analysis and multivariate regression analyses. Findings: The authors find that the CEO turnovers caused by conflicts between corporate boards and CEOs over the strategic direction of the firms tend to be preceded by significant declines in a firm's operating and stock performance and that corporate performance improves after turnovers. In addition, the authors find that an increase in long-term incentives and firm size and a decrease in turnover improve firm performance. Originality/value: While the existing corporate governance literature emphasizes oversight as the main role of the board of directors and identifies the CEO as the leader who sets the strategic direction of the firm, in cases of conflict-induced forced CEO turnover, it is the board that sets the strategic direction. This paper is the first to provide evidence regarding the implications of conflict-induced forced CEO turnovers. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study investigates the cross-sectional variation in debt restructuring among Malaysian publicly listed Government Linked companies (GLCs) and non-GLCs (NGLCs) for the period of from 2005 to 2015. It attempts to test several firm determinants that can influence the likelihood of Malaysian GLCs to exercise debt restructuring. Past studies argue that liquidity and profitability influences firm's choice to exercise debt restructuring. This study proposes variants of board of characteristics as one of the influential factors in GLCs debt restructuring since board of directors for this type of organization are usually controlled or owned by government. We employ imbalanced panel data with logistic regression as the method of analysis. The findings show that liquidity, profitability and board characteristics have significant relationship with debt restructuring. The results for profitability indicates that firm with low profitability has higher chance for debt restructuring exercise. However, liquidity has recorded an opposite relationship in our sample. This may be due to our liquidity measures the focuses on short term assets which is less appropriate in debt restructuring context. With regards to board characteristics, three variables such as board size, fraction of Malay directors and fraction of directors with Master degrees show negative and significant relationship influence on the debt restructuring.

The paper analyzes the pervasiveness of family board memberships within family business groups (FBGs), which are large and diversified form of family businesses dominant in emerging economies. The data pertain to 2017 and include board information on 640 firms affiliated to the largest 26 FBGs in Turkey. The study cluster analyzes the FBGs according to family involvement in their governance. Derived from different theoretical lenses, it also aims to identify the variables that condition different clusters. Results show that several decades after liberalization, families still control the groups pervasively though with varying degrees. Regarding the extent of family involvement in governance, different clusters are identified as tight control, vertical control, and loose control. Ownership structure emerges as the main antecedent that differentiates FBGs in different clusters. (c) 2018 Universidad de Malaga. All Rights Reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw from regulatory focus theory, to examine the effects of the "gain/no gain" nature of stock options and retirement pay on the decision to engage in cross-border acquisitions. The moderating effects of managerial discretion arising from the external industry context and internal organizational leadership structure are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ random effects negative binomial regression analysis with a longitudinal (2006-2016) data set of US public companies operating in four industries with differing levels of industry discretion: the oil and gas, paper and packaging, aerospace and defense, and telecommunications. Findings: The findings indicate that both CEO in-the-money stock options and retirement pay are positively related to cross-border acquisition activity. The results also demonstrate that managerial discretion, arising from the firm's external industry context, accentuates the positive relationship between both the value of CEO in-the-money stock options and retirement pay with cross-border acquisition activity. Practical implications: The findings provide implication for practice as understanding how retirement pay and stock options, both of which make up a substantial portion of overall CEO pay in the USA, motivate cross-border acquisition activity, may improve decisions by executives. The evidence also provides guidance to boards of directors who are charged with the responsibility of creating CEO compensation contracts. Originality/value: The paper fills important gaps in the existing research on the influence of compensation elements on firm outcomes, by offering a novel explanation for how in-the-money stock options and retirement pay affect CEOs' motivations to engage in cross-border acquisitions.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: Boards of directors of large companies all over the world frequently have a certain number of shared directors, which can be motivated by social structures that foster different types of links, including investments and vertical relationships. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects that board interlocking exerts on innovation, considering the different nature of shared directors that finally determines the type of links dominating the boards. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses were conducted using data collected from 69 Spanish listed innovative sector companies during the period 2010-2014, which provided an unbalanced panel of 325 data observations. Findings: The results suggested that the typology of interlocks determined their effects on innovation, which had a positive influence when independent and extra-industry directors held multiple directorships, whereas it was negative in the case of intra-industry and women interlocking directors. Practical implications: This study provided evidence for the diverse effects of interlocking directorates and contributed to the open debate on the best board composition for improving business innovation, considering the common feature of shared directorships. Originality/value: The value of this research was twofold. On the one hand, the study considered a wide typology of interlocking directorates, such as women, affiliated and independent directors, intra- and extra-industry directorships, as well as shared directors from the same country. On the other hand, the effects of these different interlocking directorate typologies were analysed on innovation by considering different innovation indicators. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

This article examines how the impact of Information technology (IT) governance by the board of directors on firms' financial performance can be mediated through IT operating capabilities, and how such board IT governance (B-ITG) can modulate the influence of IT operating capability on financial performance. Findings based on a survey of 89 corporate directors indicate that both B-ITG and IT operating capability increase financial performance. They further point to complex B-ITG effects on financial performance, including complementarity with and shaping IT operating capability. They show that high B-ITG suppresses the effect of IT operating capability on financial performance and that B-ITG effects on financial performance are partially mediated through IT operating capability.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the behavioral agency model (BAM) by focusing on the moderating role of CEO gender on the relationship between CEO stock options and risk "systematic vs idiosyncratic" and the performance consequences "positive vs negative" of these option incentives. Design/methodology/approach: Data on CEO's stock option portfolios are collected from the Standard & Poor's (S&P's) ExecuComp. This paper uses a panel data analysis for matched samples of CEOs in S&P's 1,500 listed firms over the period 2006-2013. Findings: The results indicate a more conservative, risk-averse posture in the case of female CEOs than for male CEOs when they are compensated with stock options for idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. The results also confirm that female CEOs in low systematic risk contexts, although more conservative, take more prudent risks that produce better long-term outcomes as compared to their male counterparts. Practical implications: Important implications for the design of optimal CEO's compensation packages emanate from this study. Findings provide useful tools for board of directors to design CEO's pay packages that take into account the different risk behavior of male and female CEOs with the aim of enhancing firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence within the area of stock option-based compensation by focusing on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk when the effect of CEO stock option is analyzed and performance implications of awarding options to male and female CEOs.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to refute the work of Andersen (2017) by suggesting a different theoretical view and to argue that the concept of managerial discretion is one of the core dimensions that cannot be discarded when studying corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses theoretical frameworks from recent literature, definitions and empirical studies on the concept of managerial discretion and corporate governance. Findings: Several studies have empirically tested and measured the concept of managerial discretion, some have provided validity and reliability of the concept and others have showed the direct impact of discretion on firm performance. Practical implications: Research on managerial discretion provides owners and board of directors a clear advice on how much discretion can be granted to top executives by taking into consideration the different dimensions of the external and internal environment. Originality/value: This paper concludes that corporate governance research will not improve if it abandons the concept of managerial discretion. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the contribution of knowing in practice (KP) to the development of dynamic capabilities (DC) in the context of health-care organizations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a case study in a Brazilian hospital in three stages using the data collection techniques of interviews, focus groups, shadowing and conjoint analysis. The participants were health-care employees, supervisors, project managers and members of the board of directors. Findings: This paper identifies the contribution of KP to develop DC based on strategic practices and their respective microprocesses as key elements to DC microfoundations. In the end, the paper points out a mutual contribution between the theoretical approaches. Research limitations/implications: This proposal makes sense in organizations where the practices have a strategic nature, such as hospitals and service providers. Practical implications: This study suggests an alignment between strategic and operational views, stimulating learning across organizational levels. Originality/value: KP helps to give DC a tangible form by including a human dimension into microfoundations, giving voice to practitioners in the strategic decisions. The integration of KP and DC approaches allows organizations to perceive DC in daily practices making DC present in every organizational level, stimulating a continuous organizational learning process.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Drawing on an institutional theoretical perspective, we investigate the impact of the origins of organizational legitimacy on systematic risk using a sample of 358 Brazilian companies between the years 2002 and 2007. We regard three origins of legitimacy--formal-regulatory (presence in premium listings), cultural-cognitive (board of directors), and normative legitimacy (reputation)--to empirically investigate how a company's size and adherence to premium lists moderate other sources of legitimacy. Our results indicate that only under apparently better quality corporate governance conditions--presence in premium listings--do corporate reputation and the board of directors reduce systematic risk. In addition, we show that the effect of reputation on risk is positively moderated by firm size. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC.

Purpose: Some scholars have claimed that CEOs make decisions, while boards of directors control these decisions by applying the concepts of decision management and decision control. These concepts were suggested more than 30 years ago and are still applied in corporate governance research. They are now challenged on the basis of scholarship on corporate governance and management. Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance addresses the authority and responsibility that boards of directors and executives have. Management theory addresses planning and control in corporations. Findings: The relationship between the owners (the boards of directors) and the top managers is hierarchical. This paper concludes that owners or boards of directors make decisions on main and strategic goals. Decisions cannot be controlled, but the implementation and outcomes of plans can. The latter is managers' responsibility. The terms "decision management" and "decision control" are undefined and do not describe what takes place in organizations. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not contain any new empirical data. Originality/value: Management theory offers clear definitions of decisions, decision-making and control. The concepts of decision management (initiation and implementation) and decision control (ratification and monitoring) neither properly describe who makes major and strategic decisions nor how and who controls the consequences of these decisions.

In order to ensure profitability for shareholders, optimal contracting recommends the alignment between executive compensation and company performance. Large organizations have therefore adopted executives remuneration systems in order to induce positive market reaction and motivate executives. Complex compensation schemes are designed by Boards of Directors using strong pay-performance incentives that explain high levels of executive pay along with company size, demand for management skills and executive influence. However, the literature remains inconclusive on the pay-performance relationship owing to the various empirical methods used by researchers. Additionally, there has been little effort in the literature to compare methodologies on the pay-performance relationship. Using the dominant agency theory framework, the purpose of this study is to establish and examine the relationship between firm performance and executive pay. In addition, it intends to assess the characteristic of model specifications commonly adopted. To this aim, a quantitative analysis consisting of three complementary methods was performed on panel data from South African listed companies. The results of the main unrestricted first difference model indicate a strong non-linear relationship where the impact of current and previous firm performance on executive pay can be observed over 2 to 4-year period providing support to the optimal contracting theoretical perspective in the South African business context. In addition, CEO pay is more sensitive to firm performance as compared to Director pay. Lastly, although it affects executive pay levels, company size is not found to improve the pay-performance relationship. (c) 2019 The author(s). This publication is an open access article.

We examine the relation between reserve management and a set of audit committee characteristics of property-liability insurers, using reserve errors as a proxy for reserve management. We find that insurers with three audit committee characteristics have more conservative loss reserve estimations: larger audit committee size and more members with accounting expertise, and more audit committee meetings. Our results also find that three recommendations of the 1999 Blue Ribbon Committee can make corporate audit committees more effective: a minimum audit committee size, a minimum level of accounting expertise, and a minimum number of audit committee meetings. These results were obtained when we controlled for board of director characteristics, firm-specific characteristics, and Sarbanes-Oxley. Some board composition variables (e.g., director ownership) also have an impact on reserve management during our study period. The evidence overall suggests that the audit committee and some board characteristics have an impact on reserve management (earnings management) even in a regulated environment such as the insurance industry.

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The central hypothesis of the managerial power approach (MPA) states that power is the main driver of executive compensation. The positive impact of power on compensation is allegedly demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies. We argue that the hypothesis of a positive impact of power on pay is not falsifiable empirically. The MPA is thus not testable. Empirical studies in this vein can only be interpreted as validation procedures for the empirical power measures employed. We suggest a new theoretical framework for research on the power-compensation relationship. This framework can be used to identify valid power measures empirically. The arguments presented in our paper allow for a reassessment of the role of power in the corporate governance debate. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

This paper investigates whether firms with strong corporate governance perceive non-audit services (NAS) as a threat to auditor independence or as a mechanism to improve audit quality. The sample consisted of 706 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia in 2014 and employed six proxies for corporate governance. The findings show that firms with a bigger audit committee and a higher proportion of independent members in the audit committee are linked with higher NAS, consistent with the resource-based view. The study also found that audit firms in the Big 4 were paid a higher amount of NAS compared to non-Big 4 firms., in line with the general view that the Big 4 auditors supply higher quality services than the non-Big 4. However, it was also found that a more independent board of directors is associated with a low NAS. This suggests that although the board of directors might perceive NAS a threat to auditor independence, a strong audit committee subscribes to the argument that the benefits outweigh the costs. This study contributes to the present literature on the determinants of NAS in an emerging market and would be informative to regulators worldwide when considering new policies related to NAS.

Boards and their directors, a central aspect of the firm's leadership team, find themselves needing to be more accountable than they have ever been before. Accordingly, this chapter considers the corporate board and its ability to create value and to refocus the processes and outcomes of how it is held accountable. Initially, I start by looking at how stakeholder and shareholder views are largely complementary theoretical assumptions, both reflecting a social paradigm associated with the proper roles and responsibilities of firms. I then show how shareholder- and stakeholder-based views can be used to direct boards toward activities that reinforce one another by first outlining two main commonalities of both perspectives - accountability and value - and then illustrating how a board's accountability to both shareholders or stakeholders can lead to value being created in the long term for the other. Lastly, I show how organizational values shape perceptions of how value is created. (c) Joanne B. Ciulla and Tobey K. Scharding 2019.

Corporate governance remains a privileged field for researchers in management sciences. The interest in looking at the governance bodies is that they are supposed to play a very important role in driving the business towards the goals set efficiency and effectiveness. Determining the composition and the ideal functioning of these governance bodies is an ultimate goal for researchers and practitioners, but the road is still long because the conclusions of the studies made up to this day on the subject do not unanimously. One of the topics (and little discussed) about the effect of gender diversity on the effectiveness of the board of directors.The purpose of this article is to present a contribution in the analysis of the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors on the financial performance of Moroccan banks. After a presentation of the mission of the board of directors and its objectives, we presented the main theories, which evoked our problematic, then to present a synthesis of the works, which studied the impact of the presence of the women on the performance of the banks and finally an empirical analysis of this relationship. This analysis is made from the data of six Moroccan banks over a period of 10 years. The results showed that there is only one positive and significant relationship between the presence of women and the financial performance expressed by ROE and ROA.

The study aims to determine how different factors shape the size of boards of directors in private firms conducting an initial public offering (IPO) on the regulated Euronext Paris market. These factors include the presence of a venture capitalist, ownership structure, firm-specific characteristics and CEO characteristics. To study the determinants of board size, we used a sample of 568 firms that went public from 1995 to 2012 and found that the boards tend to become more independent shortly after going public, which indicates that firms are affected by monitoring in financial markets. The study found strong evidence that ownership variables, board structure variables, CEO characteristic variables and firm characteristic variables tend to affect board size. Our results also indicate that venture capitalists are a major catalyst for IPOs because they provide financing and strategic advice, act as an opposing force to the CEO and shape the governance structure.

This paper examines how the ownership structure and board of directors' features determine the managerial opportunistic behavior exemplified in the management of accounting earnings. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship of firm-level and country-level corporate governance systems on the earnings management in the Spanish corporate sector. Results reveal that the varying efficiency of the corporate governance systems is reflected in the way in which accounting discretion is performed. We found evidence that earnings management is reduced as the voting rights of the controlling shareholder increased and that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between insiders' ownership and the earnings manipulation. Regarding the board characteristics, we observe that larger, independent boards, those with a larger proportion of female members, and those with an audit committee compounded by a greater proportion of outside independent directors oversee managers more efficiently, constraining their capacity to manage earnings. To the contrary, board duality increases the likelihood of opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting. We found that when the institutional environment improves in the Spanish context, the discretionary power of the corporate sector to overstate the financial statements is reduced. The findings prove the necessity of reinforcing the rules and regulations toward a more transparent disclosure of the financial statements. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of corporate board and audit committee characteristics and ownership structures on market-based financial performance of listed firms in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: It applies system GMM (generalized method of moments) as the baseline estimator approach, and ordinary least squares and fixed effects for robustness checks on a sample of 452 firms listed on the Thai Stock Exchange for the period 2000-2016. Findings: Relying mainly on the system GMM estimator, the empirical results indicate some emerging trends in the Thai economy. Contrary to expectations for an emerging market and prior research findings, ownership structures, particularly ownership concentration and family ownership, appear to have no significant influence on market-based firm performance, while managerial ownership exerts a positive effect on performance. Moreover, as expected, board structure variables such as board independence; size; meeting and dual role; and audit committee meeting show significant explanatory power on market-based firm performance in Thai firms. Practical implications: These findings are important for policymakers in constructing an appropriate set of governance mechanisms in an emerging market context, and for corporate entities and investors in shaping their understanding of corporate governance in the Thai institutional context. Originality/value: Unlike previous literature on the Thai market, this study is the first to use the more advanced econometric method known as system GMM estimator for addressing causality/endogeneity issues in governance-performance relationships. The findings indicate new trends in the explanatory power of ownership structure variables on market-based firm performance in Thai-listed firms. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2020 Academy of Management Review.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study builds on implementation intention theory to indicate that both business and family governance practices influence the succession planning process in family firms. In addition, this study draws on goal adjustment theory to explore whether the family CEO's emotions, being his or her inability to let go of the family firm, hamper the governance decisions of the board of directors concerning that succession planning process. Applying a moderated mediation analysis on a sample of 225 family firms, results show that board involvement in the succession process mediates the positive relationship between the use of family governance practices and the level of succession planning. In addition, the family CEO's inability to let go negatively moderates this mediating relationship which signifies that emotions influence governance outcomes in family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Given that ideological differences are likely to become an increasing source of conflict within organizations, we introduce ideological diversity as a new board-level diversity construct and hypothesize its effects on CSR performance. We hypothesize that ideological diversity can have a negative effect on CSR performance through social categorization mechanisms. Alternatively, we introduce a competing hypothesis that suggests a positive effect of ideological diversity on CSR performance through information processing mechanisms. We test our hypotheses on a panel of 372 Dutch municipality boards from 2014 to 2017 using a fixed effects OLS regression. These methods allow us to control for unobserved heterogeneity and is supported by the Hausman test we perform. Results support a negative relationship between board ideological diversity and CSR performance, indicating that a high level of ideological diversity leads to a lower performance in CSR. We discuss the implications of these findings for the board diversity and CSR literatures. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Research Question/Issue: The role of the board chair has become increasingly complex in recent decades. Research on corporate governance has called for and has initiated the pursuit of more research for the purpose of creating a better understanding of the role of board chairs. We reviewed 234 academic articles published in 66 journals, structured the existing research according to an Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework, and provided a future research agenda for studies on the role of the board chair. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals that the number of published studies on the position of the board chair has grown over the last two decades. Although extant research is dominated by quantitative studies exploring the impact of the board chair position on financial performance, frequently drawing on agency and stewardship theory, recent work has moved beyond this focus and has added valuable insights. The Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework used to structure the extant research reveals that future research should pursue topics related to all components of the framework and that opportunities exist to draw from a broader set of theories. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the framework, we formulate seven specific research topics that can add valuable insights into the role of the board chair and suggest theories that can help inform research pursuing these topics. Taken together, these topics have the potential to create valuable insights into how board chairs are appointed, develop competencies, and interact and work with the CEO, the top management team, the board, and other stakeholders while acknowledging the influence of contextual factors, such as ownership, diversity, the firm's development stage, and external events and trends. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review shows a growing global movement toward prescribing more corporate governance regulations and separating the positions of the board chair and the CEO. We show that many aspects need to be considered when choosing a governance configuration and when appointing a board chair because this role is becoming increasingly demanding.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

To better understand how executives impact resource allocation, we investigate the three underpinnings of dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs) as antecedents of related business diversification (RBD) and how they interact with firm resources to influence RBD. Taking football as the research subject, we analyze the joint impact of managerial human capital, managerial social capital, and managerial cognition within the board of directors of English Premier League clubs. We rely on a unique 15-year panel dataset and show that more specific managerial human capital and a long-term orientation among the board of directors increase RBD while additional general managerial human capital and managerial social capital diminish RBD. In addition, our findings reveal that DMCs moderate the relationships of physical and financial resources with RBD in different directions. Our study is amongst the first to analyze all three underpinnings of DMCs and to endorse the practical relevance of DMCs for RBD. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Human capital has been traditionally viewed in terms of how an individual's investment in knowledge, skills and abilities can lead to higher pay or promotions. More recently, human capital has been regarded as a unit-level resource using the term "human capital resources" to consider the aggregate effects of human capital. The purpose of this paper is to examine the collective human capital present in a firm's board of directors as a valuable resource leading to superior firm outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined the effects on firm innovation of the scientific expertise of corporate directors, average board tenure and the presence of a firm's founder on the board. Data from a sample of pharmaceutical firms were analyzed with the dependent variable, innovation, measured as patent applications and both individual and unit-level human capital measures of the predictor variables. Findings: The results show that the presence of a founder-director is positively related to innovation and more pronounced when combined with the board's scientific expertise. Board tenure shows a relationship to innovation and is more evident in combination with the board's aggregate level of scientific expertise. The effect of directors' scientific expertise is also greater when measured at the board level of scientific expertise. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should examine these relationships within a broader context extending the research to other industries thereby incorporating wider variation in both the antecedents and measures of innovation. In addition, future studies might investigate a likely non-monotonic relationship of board tenure with strategic outcomes, recognizing the non-linear nature of effects of board tenure. Practical implications: In addition to the theoretical and empirical implications, this research may also inform practicing managers charged with constituting their boards of directors and provide some guidance for the recruitment and retention of board members. The research may also assist top managers and investors in knowing when the presence of a founder on the board is useful and supportive of the firm's strategic direction. Originality/value: The study extends scholarly understanding of human capital theory beyond the top management team to boards of directors demonstrating the importance not only of directors' individual capital but also how it combines with that of other directors. Moreover, it enhances understanding of board characteristics beyond the bounds of demographic characteristics to show that additional qualities affect firm strategy. This research also informs managers, boards and investors how boards might be more effectively constituted to impact firm strategy. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

This research aims to examine the effect of board characteristics on the Maqashid Shariah Index (MSI) of the performance of Indonesian Islamic banks, using panel data regression. Independent variables, namely the characteristics of the board of commissioners, board of directors, and Shariah supervisory board, are related to board internal ownership, board expertise, board independence, cross-membership of boards, and board tenure, with size and growth as controlling variables, while the dependent variable is maqashid shariah performance in Islamic banks. The study samples include 12 Islamic banks in Indonesia which regularly published their annual reports and management over the period 2009 to 2017. The results from both models, with and without control variables, show that board ownership (commissioner and director), board cross-membership (commissioner and Shariah supervisor) and Shariah supervisor expertise do not have an impact on the MSI. Moreover, the results from the model without control variables show that commissioner expertise has a positive impact on the MSI, while board tenure (commissioner and director) and commissioner independence have a negative impact on the index. These results provide recommendations for the Islamic banking industry, so that it can be applied optimally to achieve the main objectives of the maqashid Shari'ah.

This study explores contextual and organisational factors that influence the likelihood of adopting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-friendly practices. Drawing on institutional theory, we hypothesise that state laws, state conservativism, and localised LGBT-friendliness density will have a direct effect on the adoption of LGBT-friendly practices. Given the observed variation in the adoption of these practices, we also draw on strategic choice and the upper echelons perspective and hypothesise that the effect of institutional mechanisms is moderated by the beliefs and values of powerful organisational agents (chief executive officers and boards of directors). Our sample consists of 201 U.S.-based Fortune 1000 companies over a period of seven years, and we test our hypotheses using a Cox proportional hazards survival analysis. Our results offer support for the role of state conservativism and localised LGBT-friendliness density in the likelihood of LGBT-friendly practices adoption, as well as for the moderating role of chief executive officer and board of directors' political orientation.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by a board of directors. While prior research has surveyed the impact of performance and governance-related factors on CEO selection decisions, our understanding of the implications of a firm's global context is limited. This article explores the influence of home country globalization, international diversification, and the undertaking of major cross-border acquisitions on the appointment of a CEO with a global mind-set. Using a sample of European and U.S. firms from the Global 500 ranking from 2005 to 2010, we find that companies are likely to match the characteristics of new CEOs with their global strategic contexts. Managerial Summary: In this article, we highlight the interplay between a firm's global context and CEO selection. Our findings indicate that executives aspiring to reach the C-suite should be highly attuned to the imperatives of aligning their knowledge bases, mind-sets, and perspectives to grasp the challenges faced by companies operating within a global context. From the board's perspective, the selection of a new CEO provides the opportunity to assess a firm's future strategic direction and enables the board to select an executive with the managerial capabilities required to address the challenges of globalization.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine various factors affecting the pricing of audit services and the selection of auditors in the Indian audit market. This paper also aims to investigate the impact of financial distress conditions on the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm, particularly in the context of a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 22,644 firm-years for 1,366 Indian firms from 1990 to 2015. The authors adopt ordinary least squares regression technique to model audit fee, and logistic regression technique to model auditor choice as a function of various factors relating to firm attributes and auditor characteristics. Findings: This paper finds that auditors tend to charge an audit fee premium when they are affiliated to a Big 4 auditor, have industry specialization or jointly provide auditing and non-auditing services. Additionally, firms with larger boards, higher proportion of independent board of directors and CEO-Chairman separation are more likely to choose a Big 4-affiliated auditor. The results also suggest that financially distressed firms tend to pay significantly lower audit fees and are more likely to choose non-Big 4 auditors. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies which investigate how financial distress impacts the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm in the context of emerging economies. The findings of this paper raises serious concerns about the credibility of the audited financial statements and corporate governance mechanisms of firms undergoing financial distress. The empirical results of this paper have strong implications for practitioners, regulators and investors. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and other questionable business incidents that appear to harm stakeholders frequently afflict firms yet draw disparate investor reactions. We address this disparity by investigating the association between firm legal orientation and investor reactions to CSI. We hypothesize the proportion of board members and top management team (TMT) executives with law degrees affects investor perceptions of firm foresight, and in turn, their judgment of blame and consequent punishment. Based on abnormal returns to 629 announcements of CSI and 308 publicly traded S&P 500 firms, we find that both too small and too large a proportion of board of directors and TMT members with law degrees lead investors to mete out harsher punishment. This inverted u-shaped link is further affected by firm size, firm risk, and industry competition. Our investigation sheds light on the link between executive education and financial performance in the context of CSI and investor perceptions of foresight. (c) 2020 W.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance and earnings opacity in China. Design/methodology/approach: Two corporate governance mechanisms form the basis of the analysis: 1) the board of directors and 2) the external audit function. OLS regression analysis is employed on a large sample from 2000 to 2014 with 20,235 firm-year observations. Findings: Corporate governance is found to be associated with reduced levels of earnings opacity for Chinese listed companies. Furthermore, the association between corporate governance and reduced levels of earnings opacity strengthened after the implementation of various key reforms. Practical implications: Chinese regulators are advised to proceed with caution as not all Western approaches to corporate governance are transferrable to the Chinese setting. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by analyzing broad latent constructs of corporate governance in addition to individual observable dimensions in order to reveal that various key reforms have been successful in strengthening the link between governance and reporting quality for Chinese listed companies.

This study investigates the determinants of board of director compensation from the view of strategic management. Specifically, this study examines the association between product market competition and directors' compensation for a sample of 524 listed firms in Malaysia from 2010 to 2014. We find that there is a positive relationship between a competitive firm and its compensation to its directors. Our research indicates that managerial incentives reflect more of talent appreciation, rather than purely for acknowledging better performance or a bigger size firm. This research contests the use of agency theory and managerialism in explaining directors' compensation, especially for the developing country context of Malaysia. Our findings also imply that firms may pay higher compensation in a competitive market. (c) 2019 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

Objectives Nowadays, the study of gender diversity in the business environment is becoming considerably relevant, due to the incorporation of women into the working life. Social advances have enabled women to leave behind their limited roles at home, and their inclusion in the labour market has gone beyond the compliance with ethics and legislation. Family firms have played a key role in the inclusion of women in the workplace, due to, among other reasons, the existence of shared roles and the overlapping of family and business values. However, and surprisingly, there are not many studies investigating the role of women in family firms. In recent years, the academic interest has been focused on gender diversity, namely on the inclusion of women on boards of directors and in top management positions. Specifically, the latest research analyses how gender diversity on boards of directors and in top management positions affects different measures of firm performance, focusing on profitability measurements. However, the obtained results so far are not conclusive at all, revealing that the presence of women on corporate governance bodies can have a positive, a negative or even a non-significant influence on firm performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is shedding some light on this controversial topic, by analysing whether the presence of women in three corporate governance bodies, i.e. the board of directors, the general meeting of shareholders and the top management team, of agri-food family firms influences the firms' economic efficiency. Methods To develop the empirical part of this study, a sample of 147 family firms pertaining to the agri-food industry has been used. The final sample was obtained from a wider study analysing the general characteristics of a representative sample of Spanish family firms. In this regard, the data presented in this article come from two different sources: on the one hand, the financial and economic data were obtained from the SABI (Sistema de Analisis de Balances Ibericos) database of Bureau Van Dijk; on the other hand, the qualitative data were obtained from the database provided by the Spanish Institute of Family Businesses and the Spanish Network of Family Business Chairs, based on a survey conducted in 2016. The proposed hypotheses were checked by performing ordinary least-squares regression analysis. Findings The obtained findings suggest that the presence of women on the boards of directors of Spanish agri-food family firms has a positive and very significant influence on economic efficiency. Moreover, the presence of women at the general meeting of shareholders also has a positive and significant influence on the firms' economic efficiency. However, the presence of women in top management teams does not exert a significant impact on economic efficiency. Contributions The present article offers several contributions to the literature. First, this study is pioneering in considering the role exerted by female directors, shareholders and managers in the economic efficiency of family firms. Although women have exerted a fundamental role within business families, their influence in the firm sphere has been very limited. In this vein, our work answers the call for further research on gender issues in family firms. Second, this study shows that gender diversity on both the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders of Agrifood family firms has a positive impact on business efficiency, revealing that women influence economic and business development. In this sense, not only is the presence of women attributed to an increase in economic efficiency, but also to an increase in social performance. Third, with regard to the agri-food industry, this study makes an important contribution at both the theoretical and the empirical level. Studies related to the agri-food industry are usually experimental studies based on comparisons and evaluations to improve production systems, as well as technical studies to achieve sustainable use of natural resources. However, there are few studies aimed at analysing the management of agri-food family firms, with special attention to the participation of a vulnerable stratum, such as women. As a fourth contribution, we have a sectored study of family firms, which allows to present more precise findings in an important industry for the society and the economy at a global level, which is the agri-food industry. Practical Implications The present work contributes to give visibility to those women present in the corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, since it reveals that female participation favours the economic and financial results of these firms. Although it is true that previous studies have analysed the effect of female presence in cooperative firms, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are not studies addressing this issue in agri-food family firms. Furthermore, from a legal perspective, this work highlights the level of influence that both the Organic Law 3/2007 of March 22nd 2007, for effective equality between women and men (BOE, 2007), and the Law 35/2011 of October 4th 2011, on shared ownership in agricultural holdings (BOE, 2011), have had on the incorporation of women in ownership and management positions in agricultural holdings. Therefore, the obtained findings in this study may be an incentive to promote the restructuring of corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, increasing the presence of women in them. Limitations The contributions of this study are no free of limitations, which, in turn, may provide opportunities for future research. First, we have focused on the economic efficiency of agri-food family firms. Thus, the obtained findings may not be applicable to other industries. However, from our point of view, it is of utmost interest to evaluate the role of women in agri-food family firms to the extent that in southern Spain the agri-food industry is especially relevant for the regional economy, as well as because the issue of gender diversity in the business environment is acquiring special interest in recent years. Another limitation of our study is that we have considered the female presence in three corporate governance bodies, even though the participation of women in any other corporate body can be beneficial to firms. A final limitation would be that the analysed family firms are located in Spain and thus, it would be necessary to determine whether different findings are obtained in other countries or regions. Originality The study of gender diversity in the business environment has emerged as a fruitful field of research in recent years, but the current knowledge regarding the influence of women on firms' outcomes is still scarce. This paper contributes to the family business literature, both in terms of corporate governance and in terms of gender, by offering some conclusions regarding the presence of women in different corporate governance bodies. Furthermore, this paper provides new research avenues that will provide a better comprehension for scholars and specialists for future investigations in the field. (c) 2020, CIRIEC.

This article studies the impact of the Board of Directors (BOD) on financial reporting quality (FRQ) in Vietnam listed companies. The research uses FEM, REM and GLS regression models, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010-2018, with 2162 observations. The research results have found that the BOD size, BOD independence, BOD chairperson cum CEO has a positive impact on FRQ while BOD meeting frequency has a negative impact on FRQ. In addition, the audit quality, the ratio of liabilities has a positive impact on FRQ while company size has a negative impact on FRQ. Further, the percentage of female BOD members does not have an impact on FRQ. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to improve FRQ by considering of factors of the board of director in a more effective manner. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

Ethics of governance deficiencies including weak management of the prin-cipal-agent problem by the board of directors and conflict over the strategic intent of the organisation between groups of employees such as the board of directors, top management team, and the middle-line managers working in small teams are age old problems for stock exchange listed companies. These matters continue to cause shareholders of listed companies much concern, creating tense annual general meetings and robust community debate on how to reign in blatant moments of managerial hegemony (or dominance) with agents exploiting principals, at times at great financial cost to long suffering shareholders. The role of the chairperson and the board applying agency theory is to manage these conflicts on behalf of the shareholders; however, in many instances, company directors have failed in their duties and investors have been aggrieved - the result, war in organisations. The challenge for organisations is to avoid this source of tension and war caused by emergence of managerial hegemony over the organisation and to promote sound executive stewardship and effective social exchange among the board, executive team, and middle-line managers. These challenges are discussed and solutions are developed. The importance of strategic intent as a unifying rhetorical message as a key component of an ethics of governance regime that keeps the peace and prevents war in the organisation is explained.

An established succession planning program for the identification and grooming of its next leader helps maintain the continuity of firm strategy and leadership style, which influences long-term firm performance and viability. Disclosure of succession planning information may alleviate investors' doubts about whether the firm has a succession planning plan, while it may increase competition for CEO candidates, leading to increases in the cost of securing qualified candidates. This study explores what determines firms' decisions to provide this disclosure using firms that initiate CEO succession planning disclosure in a given year and their control firms. We find that firms are more likely to initiate the disclosure of CEO succession planning when 1) segment concentration (negatively related to organizational complexity) becomes lower, 2) the board of directors becomes more independent, 3) the CEO has reached the retirement age of 64, 4) the CEO becomes more important relative to other executive officers in the industry labor market, 5) the number of analysts following (reflecting external monitoring) increases, and 6) CEO tenure (reflecting CEO entrenchment) declines. Overall, our findings suggest that the disclosure of CEO succession planning is motivated by investor demand for a smooth transition among top management and enhanced transparency in CEO succession planning.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

The international literature has deepened the importance of analysing the composition of BoDs in order to understand their effectiveness and efficiency. Along this path of research, this chapter aims to investigate the board diversity reviewing the main contributes developed on this topic. Specifically, the chapter illustrates the different sources in terms of diversity in the boardrooms, putting in evidence the role of regulations and institutional investors at promoting the growth of this diversity. The analysis is proposed through a cost-benefit approach, to illustrate the potential advantages and the relative risks connected to the diversity in BoDs. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

The objective of the present study was to determine the differences in the effectiveness of the control of the board of directors for companies that present duality executive director-chairman of the board, and those that do not present this duality. The research is explained through a quantitative approach for which an instrument is used to measure the effectiveness of the control, and is based on four dimensions. The data analysis was done through the test of differences of means using t student. As a result, the duality executive director-chairman of the board influences the performance levels of independent directors and performance evaluation of the executive director.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance. Findings would assist the committee of MCCG2012 and other authorities to reinforce on the corporate governance compliance and good practice. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

Research into boards of directors has provided mixed support for the view that outside directors' independence or leadership by an independent chair improves monitoring. In this study, we use a micro-level approach to provide a better understanding of why outside directors have difficulty in monitoring the CEO. We highlight that an important reason for this lies in the boardroom dynamics associated with (a) outside directors' cognitive conflict with the CEO and (b) the chair's leadership of the board. Our inductive analyses of video observations of board meetings in five Australian corporations revealed the importance of chair participative leadership during disagreement episodes in the boardroom. Follow-up in-depth interviews of board meeting participants highlighted the importance of psychological safety as a key mechanism explaining why participative board chairs appear so effective in dealing with board-CEO cognitive conflict. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study involving data on 310 outside directors from 64 Dutch boards. Whereas prior work has mostly focused on the chair's relationship with the CEO, we instead highlight the importance of the chair's role as the leader of the board and identify board psychological safety as an important element shaping director monitoring within the confines of the boardroom.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Academic research is generally seen as one of the most important goals of a university, but universities are being called upon simultaneously to assist in building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem and contributing to economic growth. Universities can be the source of startups based on academic research results and thereby influence a given industrial context. This paper investigates the impact of academic entrepreneurship on the economic performance of university spin-offs (USOs) and, in particular, how the composition of the founding team, the diversity of academic ownership, CEO duality, and the presence of women on the board of directors affect USO success. We study these relationships with a cross-sectional sample of 136 firms in southern Italy. Our findings highlight that governance and ownership can influence various indicators that are often used for measuring enterprise success in different ways and that, based on the specific success metrics, managers or policymakers should consider different aspects to better understand a USO's potential for success.

Prior research documents that information transmitted via director networks affects firms' policies and real economic activities. Given a manager's potential monopoly over firm information, it is important to analyze whether information transmission through director social networks undermines the manager's control. Specifically, we explore whether information flow through director networks influences managers' ability to hoard bad news. We predict and find that the extent of external connections of the board of directors is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Additional analysis implies that this evidence is driven by firms with more powerful executives, with weaker auditor monitoring, or subject to strong investor protection, and by directors with greater monitoring incentives or responsibilities and directors with less firm-specific knowledge. Collectively, our research lends empirical support for the monitoring view under which better-informed directors narrow the scope for bad news hoarding evident in stock price crash risk. In another series of tests, we fail to find evidence consistent with the information leakage view under which directors pass sensitive firm-specific information to connections that trade on the information before its public release. Other analysis helps dispel the concern that the endogenous match between directors and companies is spuriously responsible for our core results. Our empirical findings have important implications on how social networks affect the proper functioning of capital markets. (c) CAAA

Generating and implementing innovative ideas is a key organizational effort to achieve superior performance and secure competitive advantages. Accordingly, the influence of strategic leaders on organizational innovation is increasingly drawing research attention. In this study, we review and synthesize research on how strategic leaders (chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors) influence innovation and propose a framework to guide future research on this important topic. We explain how existing theories rely on discretional or architectural mechanisms to explain strategic leaders' influence on innovation and review how current studies relate strategic leaders to the specific stages of the innovation process. We also discuss the role of the internal and external environment in moderating these relationships and provide an overview and criticism of theoretical and methodological issues. Overall, we discuss the most relevant findings of the field, analyze how specific suggestions drawn from our framework can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the influence of strategic leaders on innovation, and propose multiple research opportunities.

We theorize that female candidates considering CEO roles will perceive greater termination vulnerability in such roles than their male counterparts. We further theorize that indicators of recent organizational distress will exacerbate female CEO candidates' perceptions of termination vulnerability, while the presence of female leaders will mitigate these concerns. To test our arguments, we examine the initial values of newly appointed female and male CEOs' severance agreements from 2007 to 2014. Results support our arguments and begin to shed light on the factors that influence female executives' concerns about CEO roles and ultimately firms' ability to appoint female CEOs.

Research and development (R&D) is a key contributor to organizations' pursuit of innovation. In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending--the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk-taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages.

This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study documents a positive and robust effect of co-opted boards on firm innovation. This effect is mainly driven by co-opted independent directors. Firms with more co-opted independent directors are associated with lower sensitivities of CEO pay and turnover to performance. It suggests that co-opted boards promote innovation by insulating managers' career concerns from innovation risk and supporting incentive contracts that motivate innovation. Overall, our study provides new evidence on co-opted boards benefiting firm innovation. (c) 2020 The Eastern Finance Association

Drawing on the notion of "faultlines" and the upper echelons perspective, we argue that the gender faultline strength of a board of directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly, while gender faultline strength negatively relates to strategic change under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for the hypotheses. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

The literature investigating corporate governance (CG) disclosure has predominantly stressed the monitoring role of the board of directors, analysing the association between information about the board's independence and firm market performance. Drawing from managerial studies, the governance literature has recently recognized corporate performance is affected by a wider set of directors' personal traits. However, CG reporting does not currently require disclosure of most of these characteristics. We believe knowledge of directors' personal traits is valuable for investors if these characteristics are indicators of company performance. Drawing on a sample of listed Italian family firms, we embrace a wide set of hand-collected information that captures directors' profiles to verify their association with Tobin's Q. Even if such associations are casual, we infer that information about board members' profiles beyond CG report disclosures is useful for market participants. The results from the regression analyses show that information about directors' personal details, educational backgrounds, and work experience in specific professional areas is predictive of market performance, and that the market evaluates board members' personal information that is currently ignored in CG reports. The study offers practical contributions to standard setters, highlighting the need to extend CG reporting requirements for directors' personal profiles. Further, the evidence contributes to drawing the attention of preparers and users to board of directors' profile information that is currently not disclosed in CG reporting.

This study examines the effect of board of directors' expertise and tax avoidance on corporate debt. We find that there is no association between financially expert outside directors on the board and corporate debt, which is contrary to some prior research findings. However, we do find a positive association between the proportion of financially expert inside directors on the board and debt. We also find that the debt substitution effect is significantly intensified by the presence of outside directors on the board with financial expertise, which suggests that the advice offered by these directors better informs managers to make decisions about the trade-off between the benefits and costs of debt and non-debt tax shields. We find no such effect for inside directors. Overall, this study extends the literature on corporate governance, tax avoidance and corporate debt.

This research investigates the relationship between fat cat firms and crash risk. Our empirical results find that under industry fixed effects, fat cat firms are positively associated with stock price crash, demonstrating that a self-interested board of directors leads to a serious agency problem. We find consistent results after we control for other types of fat cat firms, sample selection bias, endogeneity problem and use different measurements of crash risk. Finally, we also report that under the within-firm scenario, the more frequently firms are listed as fat-cat firm announcements, the worse agency problem it encountered, which causes fat cat firms to have higher crash risk.

We apply the psychosocial concept of generativity, or one's outlook toward the next generation, to the context of chief executive officer (CEO) succession. Integrating prior research on generativity and CEO succession, we identify two key orthogonal dimensions of CEO generativity: (a) the CEO's degree of commitment to developing the next generation of company leadership and (b) the CEO's degree of need to control the succession process and outcome. A given CEO's place on these two dimensions constitutes their overall "generativity mindset," which we conceptualize as a relatively stable motivational orientation that stems from the CEO's disposition and accumulated life experiences. From these dimensions, we identify four archetypes: The generative, hypergenerative, hypo-generative, and anti-generative CEO. We then specify how the alternative archetypes affect an array of CEO actions throughout the CEO's tenure, especially the CEO's approach to assessing and developing executives for advancement. These various actions lay the foundation for eventual succession outcomes, particularly the nature of the succession and the origin and preparation of the selected successor. The final part of our model inserts the board of directors as a potentially moderating influence in all the foregoing relationships. We conclude with an overview of follow-on research opportunities.

Purpose: This study aims to discuss the determinants of Islamic banks' efficiency. It tries to explore the source of Islamic banks' inefficiencies to propose solutions to guarantee an acceptable level of technical efficiency of such banks in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this objective, the authors use a parametric approach, especially, the stochastic frontier approach, using production function and panel data analysis. The authors apply a package Frontier 4.1 for the estimation process, which is composed of two principal steps. In the first step, the authors estimate Islamic banks' efficiency scores in different GCC countries based on an output distance function. In the second step, the analysis highlights the impact of managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance, scarcity of Shari'ah scholars, the board independence and chief executive officers' (CEOs) duality on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Findings: This study's results document that managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance and the board of directors' composition, especially, the board's independence, can largely explain the technical efficiency scores of Islamic banks in GCC countries. Especially, the authors find evidence that managerial-specific education is negatively associated with the inefficiency term. The coefficient of the Shari'ah scholar's variable has a positive sign indicating that the more there are Shari'ah experts, the more the bank is efficient. In addition, CEOs' duality seems to have no significant effect on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Practical implications: GCC Islamic banks need to improve the presence of independent members on the board of directors. In addition, these banks are invited to count more on Shari'ah auditors and educated staff characterized by a high level of competency in the domain of Islamic banking and finance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that highlights the effect of managerial-specific education in Islamic accounting and finance and scarcity of Shari'ah scholars on Islamic banks' efficiency.

Research Summary: Director retention is a common practice during acquisitions, whereby the acquiring firm adds at least one director from the target onto its board. Despite the regularity of the phenomenon, little is understood about the post-acquisition financial implications of director retention. In this exploratory study, we investigate the financial impact (via long-term investor value appropriation) of director retention in a sample of acquisitions among publicly traded firms. Our empirical analyses consistently illustrate negative financial ramifications of director retention for the acquiring firm across multiple analytic models, time horizons of performance, and samples. We delineate implications for research on boards of directors and acquisitions, and we offer preliminary theoretical logic and empirical analyses for future scholarship to elucidate the mechanisms driving antecedents and outcomes of director retention. Managerial Summary: Despite the prevalence of director retention--a practice where an acquirer adds at least one director from the target onto the board of the ongoing firm--research on the topic is equivocal about the financial implications of this practice. We argue this is a crucial oversight because new directors can have an incredible influence on the trajectory of the firm and its subsequent performance, a fact that is particularly true in the turbulent post-acquisition period. In our study, we empirically examine the impact of director retention on post-acquisition performance. Across multiple analyses and time intervals of performance, we consistently find that director retention is negatively associated with the performance of the acquiring firm. Accordingly, our findings suggest that acquirers should generally approach direction retention with caution. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

This study investigates how company secretaries (CS) influence board practices and financial reporting. All public companies have a secretary and this position may be combined with Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or legal counsel. Examining the period 2004-2015, we find that joint CS/CFOs hold more audit committee meetings, are associated with less earnings management and a greater likelihood of a clean audit opinion. Companies with joint CS/legal counsels are more timely filers and company secretaries of multiple companies schedule fewer committee meetings. These results indicate that company secretaries significantly influence board practices and financial reporting, depending on their role and busyness.

Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the top management team (TMT) structural power framework, we investigate the relationship between Chief Information Officer (CIO) structural power and forward-looking firm performance. In addition, we examine the contingency roles of market turbulence, industry IT intensity, and operating efficiency in shaping the above relationship. Using a sample of 7,185 firm-year observations and a panel fixed-effects model, we find that CIO structural power is positively associated with forward-looking firm performance (proxied by Tobin's q). Further, our results suggest that the benefits of CIO structural power are higher under greater market turbulence, higher industry IT intensity, and greater operating efficiency. Our empirical results imply that the board of directors should consider endowing CIOs with a higher structural power, especially when an organization faces greater volatility in industry sales, competes in a more IT-intensive industry, and operates at a more efficient level. This research contributes to the RBV literature and integrates RBV and structural power frameworks to offer newer insights into the contemporary role of an important TMT member, the CIO.

This paper aims to examine how chief executive officer (CEO) dominance is associated with a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement, and whether the board gender diversity moderates this relationship. We use a two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze this relationship in a sample of 700 firm-year observations from FTSE 100 listed companies covering the period from 2008 to 2017. This study shows that CEO dominance is negatively associated with CSR engagement, and that the board gender diversity is positively moderated this relationship. Our study finds evidence supporting both the critical mass theory and the upper echelons theory, and suggests that a high proportion of female in the board of directors may reduce the CEO dominance, as a key player in the top management team, and increase the CSR engagement. These results are robust to alternative econometric specifications and variable definitions. This study differs from previous studies in that we introduce the board gender diversity as a moderator of the relationship between CEO dominance and CSR engagement in the UK context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of CEO compensation for sample of the US firms. It emphasizes the presence of executive compensation persistence and the importance of CEO power besides performance while setting CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of US firms during the period 2006-2016. It is based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) models to assess the impact of numerous factors on CEO compensation. Findings: The main findings reveal that firm performance proxied by accounting-based proxies, as well as market-based proxies, plays a significant role in explaining variations in levels of executive compensation. Moreover, there is a significant persistence in executive compensation among the US sample firms. The authors also document that poor governance conditions (managerial power hypothesis) lead to high compensation levels offered to CEO. Research limitations/implications: At the end, without a doubt, the analysis has some limitations that prompt the authors to consider future research directions. One future research avenue that can help better explain the effect of firm performance on the CEO compensation is to study this issue using an international sample to determine whether country-level characteristics (e.g. creditor rights, shareholder rights and the enforcement climate) can influence this relationship. Furthermore, it can be worthwhile to deepen the analysis of CEO power and its impact on CEO compensation. It will be interesting to emphasize how the CEO power interacts with the other governance characteristics and some CEO attributes as CEO gender. Practical implications: The paper's findings have implications for practitioners, policymakers and regulatory authorities. First, the findings inform regulators that performance is not the only determinant of CEO pay level. This may warrant increased firm disclosure of the details of the pay structure. Second, the study offers insights to policymakers and members of boards of directors interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance, to better align managerial incentives to shareholder interests. Firms should strengthen the board independence and properly constitute the board committees (compensation, risk, nomination...). Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the CEO compensation determinants. It supplements the classic pay-for-performance sensitivity predictions with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory and managerial power theory. The authors develop a composite index to measure the CEO power in order to test the impact of CEO attributes on CEO pay. Additionally, it verifies whether the determinants of CEO pay depend on firm age and size. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to understand the relationship between the trust of executives in their board, board effectiveness (board performance and strategic decision quality) and organizational performance (financial and operational performance). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 184 board members in the Nordic region, using cross-sectional research design. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the used scales, whereas correlational analysis and mediation analysis via PROCESS macro in SPSS were used for testing of the hypotheses. Findings: Trust between board members is positively correlated with both dimensions of board effectiveness and both tested dimensions of organizational performance. Besides, trust between the board members positively affects both financial and operational performance (significant total effects in mediation analysis). However, trust had a direct effect only on financial performance, whereas it shows an indirect effect on operational performance through both mediators, board performance and strategic decision quality. Research limitations/implications: Future research should investigate trust into the board using a longitudinal design, and expand the sample cross-culturally, and control for the influence of other interpersonal variables in board members. Practical implications: The development of trust in work relationships serves as the foundation for the establishment of significant team and organizational benefits. Business leaders should take into consideration trust issues in business teams and cultivate a trust culture in their organizations. Social implications: The findings advance theoretical, social and empirical understanding of trust of executives in their board and its effect on board performance, strategic decision quality and perceived performance. The development of trust in work relationships enhances team performance, networks with strategic partners, community and government, and serves as the foundation for the establishment of trust in the society. Originality/value: This is one of the scarce studies that examines direct and indirect effects of trust in board and organizational outcomes. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to shed light on the effects of the CEO pay ratio and say-on-pay votes on directors' concerns about CEO pay equity. Investigation of the pay ratio disclosure rule offers opportunities to gain insights into whether equity perceptions associated with mandated pay ratio disclosure have significant effects on remuneration decisions in organizations. We conduct an online experiment with practicing corporate directors to examine the effects of CEO pay ratio disclosures and say-on-pay (SOP) votes on director decisions. Results indicate that CEO pay ratio disclosures significantly influence directors' decisions regarding executive compensation, leading directors to be less willing to increase CEO pay when the pay ratio is above the industry average pay ratio. Results also demonstrate that say-on-pay votes only influence directors' compensation decisions when the CEO pay ratio is above the industry average. Directors in firms with pay ratios that are above the industry average are less willing to increase CEO pay when they anticipate shareholder votes against a CEO pay increase than when they anticipate positive SOP voting outcomes. Directors in firms with CEO pay ratios that are below the industry average, however, are willing to increase CEO pay regardless of SOP voting outcomes. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This work aims to analyze the relationship between board independence and financial performance (variables ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q). Two perspectives on independence were used: (a) Law 964 of 2005 (mandatory in the Colombian stock market) and (b) an expanded view that included business relationships (cross-directorships, seniority on the board), financial relationships (compensation packages, ownership participation), and personal relationships (founders, members of the owner family) as factors that limit independence. Regression models (random effects) were used on an unbalanced data panel composed of 69 companies from the Colombian Stock Exchange. The results showed that a more rigorous definition of independence is better appreciated by the market. It was found that board independence does not affect accounting performance (ROA and ROE), but it does affect market performance (Tobin's Q). (c) 2021 Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

The board of directors' role is evolving and becoming more important in the wake of corporate scandals resulting in the collapse of large corporations and losses to shareholders. Poor governance can lead to wrong decision-making, which might destroy organizations, particularly during times of environmental turbulence. The 2008 Global Financial Crises followed by the 2011 Arab Spring throughout the MENA region and then the 2019 pandemic situation are few of many factors that created a turbulent economic and political environment for organizations, highlighting the importance of excellent decision-making skills. However, there is limited research on boards' decision-making during difficult times in the MENA region. The authors interviewed 26 board members of 21 companies operated under duress to examine the effects on boardroom level decision making of the magnified levels of duress and stress experienced during turbulent times. Key findings from the research include trends in emotional responses in relation to decision-making, changes in the decision-making process after crises, leadership positions, and board behavior. The authors recommend that boards incorporate diversity training and awareness into all levels of their decision-making process and to the board members' selection process. Future research should expand to different regions and industries and examine the effects of board members' personal traits and backgrounds on their quality of choices and decision-making.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

Much effort has been expended by the regulators in Jordan to enhance the code of corporate governance (CG); however, the effectiveness of CG mechanisms in monitoring management and enhancing the value of a firm is still a puzzle. This study aims to investigate the impact of CG and cash holdings (CH) on firm value as measured by the market-to-book ratio. The sample consists of all manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the years 2010-2017. The study hypotheses were tested using panel regression analysis. The research findings suggest that CH have a positive association with firm value, supporting the transaction and precautionary motives for holding cash. An interesting finding is that board expertise was found to be negatively associated with firm value. Gender diversity was found to be positively related to firm value, while board size, independence, and frequency of meetings were found to be insignificant. It seems that firms in Jordan regard strong CG mechanisms to be expensive and of little value in mitigating the negative effects of a weak legal system. These findings shed new light on the influence (or the lack of it) of boards in Jordanian firms. Consequently, the study recommends that the regulatory agencies in Jordan should consider improving governance codes and Rules to increase the effectiveness of the board and governance in general.

Every year, companies spend billions of dollars in board time and headhunter fees on CEO searches. In fact, by many accounts, the selection of the next CEO is the single most important task of the board of directors. Yet, despite the huge amount of time, money, and attention given to the task, many CEO changes fail, with disastrous consequences for all concerned.With so much at stake, it is natural to ask what companies and their boards can do to increase the odds of success. Illustrated with an abundance of real-life examples from interviews with CEOs, C-suite members, members of the boards, and headhunters supporting CEO searches, The Next CEO explains how boards can improve the odds of success with CEO succession by identifying clear CEO mandates and associated CEO profiles and by selecting CEOs that are fi t for purpose. It further explains how the CEOs of leading corporations effectively take charge and create results, providing a roadmap for incoming CEOs. These ideas are brought to life with case studies and interviews with well-known corporations such as ABB, Alibaba, Freudenberg, GE, Google, HNA, HP, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Nokia, Novartis, Roche, Sony, Tata, and Zurich Insurance.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The social entrepreneurship literature increasingly acknowledges that the board of directors is of major importance in dealing with the multiple goal pursuit of social enterprises. Using a team production perspective, we study the relationship between stakeholder knowledge in the board and the engagement of the board in counseling and decision-making (i.e., board service performance) and subsequent organizational performance. The results of our study, using a sample of Flemish social enterprises, reveal that board stakeholder knowledge is positively related to board service performance. This relationship is moderated by board behavioral integration, which is strengthening the relationship in case of high stakeholder knowledge. Finally, while board service performance is positively related to social performance and, specifically, the social goal of hiring disadvantaged people, it is not significantly related to financial performance.

Chapter 2 reveals that effective chairs of boards of directors in the UK are accomplished professionals with strong views, who lead the board without "taking up much space" and avoid the limelight. They engage directors in a collective effort, creating an environment for effective collaboration and encouraging productive behaviours by providing feedback and opportunities for collective and individual learning and development. They do not give orders or issue directives; instead they steer or nudge followers by setting agendas, framing discussion items, soliciting opinions, and seeking and providing feedback. They delineate their spheres with the CEOs--"I run the board; you run the company"--and strive to strike a fine balance between "equal distancing" and proactivity in relationships with shareholders. During the COVID-19 crisis chairs of British boards demonstrated resilience, commitment and adaptability. They quickly moved their board meetings into an online format, increased the frequency of their interactions and adjusted their agendas. Chairs of UK companies also significantly increased their time commitment and made themselves available round the clock. At the same time, most of them steered their boards away from interfering with the management's job.

This chapter explores issues related to what makes leadership teams effective, by considering how team composition and team processes affect performance in a global context. It combines concerns of leadership teams with new forms of organizing in global organizations. TankTerminal Limited is a storage and handling facility for petroleum products and crude oil located in the United Arab Emirates. Leadership teams are often seen as the people listed in an organization's annual reports as being on the board of directors and top-management teams (TMT). Boards of directors differ from TMTs in that they are not directly responsible for the day-to-day operations of an organization, but rather review major strategic decisions. Diversity poses a particular tension for leadership teams. Social categorization theory helps to explain the diversity-similarity tension in teams. Social categories are the groups that people are part of; they can vary from a team or a department to an organization or even a country.

The Board of directors is the steering wheel organisations use to achieve their goals and its composition has widely been analysed. This paper will show how the number of former government officials has increased in the board of large Spanish firms over the last two decades depending on the number of former government officials in the board and how regulated the industry is. The results will also show that even though there was a period in which more former government officials joined boards, the numbers have stabilised in recent years due to, among other factors, the increasing concerns in society related to the "revolving doors" behaviours.

This study examines the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and firm financial performance. Existing research has focused on the direct link between a proportion of women directors and firm economic outcomes, thus failing to account for possible mediating factors. Examining a panel dataset of 100 companies listed on the UK FTSE100 in the period 2009-2018, we integrated a set of women directors' attributes as mediators in the relationship between gender diversity and firm financial performance. After controlling for firm characteristics and reversed causality, the research supports the business case for board gender diversity and demonstrates the positive and mediating role of women's attributes on firm performance.

We attempt to bring clarity to the concept of strategic leadership and guide its development by reviewing and synthesizing the existing management literature on how top managers and board directors influence organizations. We propose a new definition of strategic leadership and offer a framework organized around the essential questions of what strategic leadership is, what strategic leaders do, why they do it, and how they do it. To answer these questions, we organize our review around the eight functions strategic leaders serve, the key attributes of strategic leaders, the theories scholars have used to relate these functions and attributes to outcomes, contextual factors, and the organizational outcomes that strategic leaders affect. We identify how strategic leadership research is concentrated in five streams that rarely interact with each other, and offer suggestions for connecting these streams. Our review provides a big picture of what is known about individuals at the top levels of organizations and highlights the key areas where future investigation is essential. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Design/methodology/approach: From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016-2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies' websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis. Findings: The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a company's decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)' global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairman's independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision. Research limitations/implications: The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies' decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers. Practical implications: The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairman's independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms. Social implications: Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure. Originality/value: The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies' social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.

Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n = 61 boards, n = 315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties. (c) 2021 The Author(s)

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

This special issue was developed to extend the boundaries of strategic leadership research, to help bridge the micro-macro divide regarding theories of strategic leadership, and to bring together theories that have emerged independently. In this introductory editorial, we provide an overview of the research on strategic leadership and emphasize the need for further integration of research from the organizational behavior, industrial and organizational psychology, organizational economics, behavioral strategy, and strategic management fields. We then introduce and summarize the eleven articles we accepted for this special issue by classifying them into two broad themes: (a) Chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics and (b) the dynamics of interactions among the CEO, the top management team, and the board. Finally, we propose recent theoretical and empirical foci for advancing strategic leadership research and offer a research agenda for future research highlighting several important research questions related to extending the dialogue among scholars across the different leadership and strategy domains.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light an important limit of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in pursuit of its substantial purpose, which is to achieve sustainability and contribute to achieving the objectives of United Nation (UN) Agenda 2030; the paper also suggests how to overcome those limits. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey of board members of listed and un-listed Italian companies. Data were analysed using an ordered probit model. Findings: The results show that a greater involvement of a board member in the non-financial reporting process is associated with a stronger commitment towards sustainable development. Specifically, the involvement in materiality assessment is positively associated with more proactive behaviours towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-reported assessments on beliefs and behaviours and the application of an online survey are methodology limitations of the study. Regarding theory, the study contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability, integrating upper echelons theory, which focuses on how individual attributes influence a firm's strategies and governance, with research on how leadership practices can have a positive impact on corporate sustainability goals. Practical implications: The paper underscores the opportunity for policymakers to increase the effectiveness of the NFRD through deeper involvement of the board members in the process of non-financial reporting. The results could also be of interest to governance bodies in terms of defining a board's tasks and practices to encourage the adoption of behaviours oriented towards a stronger engagement in sustainable issues. Originality/value: This is the first study to provide evidence of the relationship between individual directors' tasks and behaviours, non-financial reporting and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study highlights some of the limits of the NFRD, even after the public consultation to revise it, and suggests how to overcome these limits. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Diverse perspectives and ideas among senior leaders (top management teams and boards of directors) might generate substantial value for organizations. In theory, such diversity could provide a foundation for creative insights, innovative strategies, and strong organizational performance. Unfortunately, empirical research on these and other possible outcomes has generated a complex array of confusing findings. Our systematic review, the first to consider all types of relevant studies, attempts to make sense of the complicated landscape. On the negative side of the coin, the review highlights unsolved theoretical puzzles, severely fragmented empirical studies, and methodological conundrums. As a result, it calls into question several widespread assumptions and practices. On the positive side of the coin, our work surfaces some important pockets of consistency in existing empirical findings, mostly driven by studies using direct measures of cognitive diversity among senior leaders rather than demographic proxies. Our recommendations for the future include dramatically increasing qualitative research to move beyond a powerful deductive straightjacket that seems to exist. We also recommend taking a finer-grained approach through a substantial narrowing of quantitative research in the near term to better capture and understand key concepts, measures, and boundary conditions.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the role of alignment between organizational social consciousness and the informal and formal institutions of a country in increasing female representation on boards. Using fixed-effects and Hausman Taylor regression methodology for endogenous covariate with panel data for the years 2006-2020, we find that the greater the alignment between organizational social consciousness and certain formal (i.e., a gender quota) and informal (i.e., high gender equality) institutions, the more progress there is toward gender representation on corporate boards in Europe. We also find that more socially conscious firms make the most progress, often going beyond the minimum regulatory targets. By showing the complementarity of these factors, we address the enduring question of how the interplay of formal and informal institutions directly affects corporate behavior, thus contributing to the institutional, public policy/regulatory, and corporate governance literatures. We note the need for policymakers to go beyond mere codification of rules via quotas and simultaneously work toward raising national and organizational social consciousness levels on issues of gender equality.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

We examine the relationship between women directors and corporate social performance (CSP) by considering the contingency effects of home-country culture. Drawing on upper echelons and social role theories, we hypothesize that greater women representation on boards positively affects CSP due to their distinctive expertise, perspectives, and knowledge in this area, which strengthen their firms' attention and resources devoted to it. We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors' views and boards' openness to them. Based on data for 3175 firms across 38 countries between 2008 and 2015, our multilevel analysis provides support for most of our hypotheses. (c) 2022, Academy of International Business.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of the board of directors on the strategic decisions made by family firms, and to understand the board attributes that can alleviate the aversion of family-owned firms toward mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of several firms listed in India from 2006 to 2019 with 19,813 firm-year observations. The empirical tests have been performed using logistic and negative binomial regressions. The study also tests for endogeneity with the help of Heckman (1979) two-step treatment effects model. Findings: The study shows that board characteristics like smaller board-size, presence of outside directors, lower intensity of board activity, presence of busier board members and separation of board chair and CEO positions alleviate the inhibition of family firms toward M&A. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that investors and policymakers can encourage family firms to have smaller boards, more independent directors, passive boards and CEO nonduality to reduce their aversion toward risky activities. Family-owned firms could consider a board comprising members with multiple directorships who can bring wider knowledge and expertise which can reduce the perceived threat to socioemotional wealth (SEW) and alleviate their aversion toward M&A. Originality/value: Ownership concentration in family firms posits a unique challenge in terms of their aversion toward M&A. This study is one of the few that highlight the relevance of the monitoring and advisory role of the board in alleviating this aversion in an emerging market like India.

This study takes the chairman as the starting point to study whether the chairman-CEO duality can affect the performance, with a sample of 3568 the board of directors of the listed company leadership characteristics and performance during 2008-2018 in NEEQ market. The results found that the chairman as CEO is conducive to improving the business performance. Through the sample study of enterprise size division, it is found that in small enterprises, the chairman as CEO has a more significant positive impact on business performance than in large enterprises.

This study examines the effect of board size on the economic impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the US. Using a hand-collected dataset of 508 M&A between 2012 and 2018, we find that board size is negatively related to acquirer excess returns. In an additional analysis, we show that large boards have positive value implications for banks that combine the CEO and chairman roles as well as for large banks. Our findings indicate that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to board size is not necessarily in the interests of shareholders; instead, a more flexible and proactive formulation is needed.

Public corporations often appoint external former founders to their boards in hope that they will encourage a (re-)focus on creating future new business. Seeking to investigate this common practice, we integrate upper echelons theory with imprinting theory, arguing that founding a company indeed represents a formative experience that will leave an imprint on founders and their subsequent board decision-making. Subsequent to their founding experience, however, some founders may be subjected to likewise formative but public corporate experiences, for instance, by taking their own business public or by assuming CEO positions in other corporations, that will lead to a decay of the original founding imprint and its effect. We find support for our reasoning across corporate boards in S&P1500 firms ranging from 2000 to 2012. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Firm leaders expect their chief marketing officers (CMOs) to have significant impact on firm performance, and boards of directors (boards) consider marketing-related issues critical board-level priorities. Despite the importance of marketers and marketing to firm outcomes, boards do not appear to value CMOs at the strategy-setting level of the firm as they rarely include CMOs in board discussions and deliberations. The disconnect between the importance of marketing and the marginalization of marketers at the board level prompts the following question: How and in what ways may boards impact CMO performance? This research includes two reviews of the extant literature (from 1984 through 2021): (1) board impact on CMOs, and (2) board impact on the satisfaction, performance, and outcomes of the broader top management team (TMT), including chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief operating officers, chief technology officers, and chief strategy officers. We find that only four articles investigate the impact of boards on any functional TMT member's performance and that none specifically consider how the board may impact CMO satisfaction, performance, and outcomes. Given the lack of research, we create a conceptual framework that links board characteristics to CMO outcomes and develop a research agenda with over 50 questions as the basis to develop scholarship. Importantly, this research highlights the paucity of insight regarding board-level influence on any functional TMT member, including the CMO. Consequently, the model and research agenda can benefit multiple disciplines including marketing, finance, information technology, operations, management, and human resources.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

The current study examines the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures, media announcements of CSR awards and a firm's cost of debt in Malaysia. The sample consists of 104 Malaysian publicly listed companies belonging to the Edge Billion Ringgit Club between 2009 to 2015. The study uses panel data regression analysis and the ordinary least squares estimation method. The results find that the interaction between CSR disclosures and winning awards for a company's CSR initiatives and practices lowers the cost of debt. Our study concludes that, when a company discloses more information on its CSR initiatives and practices, it reduces the cost of debt. Thus, we argue that CSR disclosures and awards can act as proxies for branding listed firms, making them more marketable and allowing them to negotiate better debt contracts. However, the study shows that politically connected companies have a higher debt cost than non-politically connected firms. Furthermore, our results indicate that smaller boards are effective, but audit committees are not effective in monitoring the board of directors in Malaysian listed firms. (c) 2022 by the authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the direct association between firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores, CSR disclosures and executive compensation. This study further investigates the moderating role of CSR in the association between executive compensation and firms' stock market and accounting performances. Design/methodology/approach: This study collects CEO compensation information from the Execucomp database and CSR performance information from the MSCI ESG database. The final sample consists of 4,193 firm-year observations for 1,318 US public firms for the period 2009-2013. This study uses lagged regression analysis to test the direct and moderating roles of CSR in executive compensation. Findings: Regarding the direct role of CSR, this study finds that CEO compensation is positively related to CSR performance but not to firms' issuance of CSR reports. This study also finds a positive moderating role of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' stock performance. However, the authors do not identify any role for CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and accounting performance. The results also show a negative association of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firm size. Originality/value: This study fills a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on the direct association between CSR and CEO compensation and how the association between CEO compensation and firm performance is moderated by CSR scores. The novel findings of this study will benefit managers, boards of directors, shareholders and other stakeholders, including regulators and policymakers. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Many studies on the impact of boards of directors on corporate social responsibility have focused on the human capital of board members (i.e., structures and characteristics). However, the relational capital of board members (i.e., board interlock centrality) has yet to be fully explored. This study examines the extent to which board members are connected in their networks (i.e., board interlock centrality) on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in the restaurant industry. It also recognizes the moderating role of board effectiveness on the relationship between board centrality and CSR performance. On the basis of organization legitimacy theory and resource dependence theory, this study found that high-centrality boards increase positive CSR performance. The effect is more substantial when a firm has more standing board committees. The theories view firms as components of the larger social environment, and their performance depends on their ability to procure crucial resources from other firms through mutual exchange. No significant link was found between negative CSR performance and the moderating effect of board committees. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

The objective of this case-based study is to understand how the dyadic interaction between the key governance actors can influence the decision-making aimed at directing and controlling a family firm. The study provides evidence that dyadic interaction at the back stage of the formal governance process can offer a privileged position for the family firm owners who serve on the board, and the non-family member Chair of the Board, to influence decision-making before, after and between board meetings. The cases studied suggest that dyadic interactions can serve as preparation for formal board processes and complement and clarify them, yet they also have the potential to conflict with them. Dyadic interaction is also shown to offer important relational and emotional benefits that may not necessarily be achieved through larger group interaction. The findings suggest that although the actors can self-regulate their behaviour through informal rules, the rules may imperfectly address one risk of dyadic interaction--the reduced cognitive conflict among the board.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This paper aims to investigate the effect of the quality of compensation committee on the self-interested board of directors after the establishment of mandatory compensation committee. Moreover, this paper investigates the role of CEO power in the relationship between compensation committee quality and the self-interested board of directors. From the data of listed companies between 2012 and 2017, we find that firms with better compensation committees and higher CEO power can reduce the phenomenon of loss making firms yet increasing their director and supervisor compensation. However, we also find that CEO power cannot moderate the relationship between the quality of a compensation committee and a board compensation increase in a loss-making firm. Our results demonstrate that when the CEO has greater power, the compensation committee is less effective to prevent the board of directors and supervisors in loss-making firms from gaining unreasonably high compensation.

Priorliterature does not provide a clear prediction of how executive confidence affects the degree to which a firm engages in "myopic marketing management," the tendency to decrease current marketing spending to mitigate any potential earnings shortfall. We propose that highly confident CEOs are more likely to cut marketing spending to raise current earnings numbers because they believe in their ability to generate high future firm earnings that can cover the long-term losses arising from their current short-term actions. The effect is heightened when the board of directors is more independent and monitors more, but attenuated if CMOs are more confident and thus are better able to convince their CEOs and boards of directors to support continued investments in marketing. The moderating impact of CMO confidence is proposed to be stronger as the CMO becomes more powerful. Using secondary data from a broad cross-section of firms, we provide robust empirical support for our model. Our results highlight situations in which CMOs need to be wary of cuts to their marketing budget, and also provide a potential mechanism through which marketers can protect their budget in the presence of highly confident CEOs--through their own confidence levels.

The role of entrepreneurial alertness has been increasing to cope with the current fiercely competitive market. Entrepreneurial alertness enables companies to benefit from unseized opportunities and gain a competitive advantage. Therefore, the study explores the role of proactive behavior in enhancing the entrepreneurial alertness of organizations through the mediating role of dynamic capabilities. The study focuses on the Iraqi telecommunication market because of the intense competition between three major telecom companies. Data were collected through a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire distributed among employees of mobile telecommunications companies in Iraq. The sample aimed to cover different levels in the business hierarchy with a particular focus on the leading positions. Therefore, it included 299 members of boards of directors, branch managers, department heads, and chief supervisors (middle managers). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the responses. Results revealed the positive effect of adopting proactive behavior (e.g., problem prevention, innovation, and holding responsibilities) on entrepreneurial alertness (e.g., scanning, searching for, and evaluating opportunities). The results also approved the mediating role of dynamic capabilities in enhancing the relationship between proactive behavior and entrepreneurial alertness. Therefore, Iraqi governmental telecommunication enterprises are recommended to benefit from the dynamic capabilities of employees (e.g., sensing, learning, integrating, and coordinating capabilities) to maximize the positive influence of proactive behavior on entrepreneurial alertness and, accordingly, improve the prediction of production risks and threats.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on resource dependence theory we argue for an influence of business groups (BGs) on the board composition of constituent offshore financial multinational enterprises (FMNEs). Using a unique sample of 171 Caribbean FMNEs in an inter-island BG setting, we find BGs' control in constituent firms to be indicative of the importance of the internal financing and intermediation within the group network. This control leads to a higher proportion of lawyers hired to the boards of directors in BG-constituent firms and supports the argument that lawyers provide skills in complex offshore regulatory frameworks that facilitate BGs' optimal tax management. Furthermore, we observe that an increased adoption of shareholder rights governance by BG-constituent firms is associated with increased engagement with outside resource providers, increased potential conflicts of interest and hence a need for hiring more lawyers. Our interpretation is that offshore FMNEs have a need for more lawyers, whose legal skill is critical to the competitive advantage of FMNEs. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between chair-chief executive officer (CEO) demographic dissimilarities and firm internationalization. Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of listed firms in Malaysia from 2013 to 2017. This study considers three demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, i.e. differences in age, educational background and nationality. Findings: The results reveal that demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, notably differences in nationality, may result in conflicting cognitive styles, which in turn may impede the firms' ability to expand internationally, as compared to differences in age and educational background. The findings demonstrate the deleterious effects of demographic dissimilarity between these two individuals in the highest echelons on the firms' internationalization strategy due to poor communication and lack of ability to cooperate when dissatisfaction and conflicts intensify between these corporate elites. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt to examine the influence of chair-CEO demographic dissimilarities on firm internationalization. Previous studies examining firms' internationalization strategy, for the most part, restricted their scope to either the board members or top management team characteristics, but had largely overlooked the nexus between nonexecutive and executive directors through the chair and CEO. A focus on the demographic dissimilarities between the co-leaders of the firm is essential to improve the understanding of the collaboration and rivalry between them, which may affect board effectiveness and firm internationalization.

This study investigates the association between a CEO's political ideology and Corporate Environmental Performance. Although previous research has established a strong association between a CEO's political ideology and overall performance on Corporate Social Responsibility, little research has examined how it relates to a firm's environmental impact. Utilizing data on CEO political donations, this study shows that a CEO's liberalism generally has a positive effect on a firm's environmental performance. However, this relationship can be influenced by the political conservatism of the board of directors. Furthermore, liberal CEOs are inclined to prioritize environmental strength and minimize environmental concerns. This research provides insight into the intricate dynamics of how a CEO's political ideology, as well as that of the board of directors, can influence a firm's environmental performance.

This paper aims to find an answer to the questions of "whether chief executive officers (CEOs) are compensated for market risk", and "how the combined interaction of board size and CEO duality moderates this relationship" from the tenets of agency theory and managerial power theory. Even though the contracting view of agency theory posits that agents are neither to be punished nor rewarded for events that go beyond their direct control (market risk), the research findings in the corporate governance domain are contradictory. It was found that Chinese and American executives were paid for market risk, including oil prices and exchange rates, which was explained by retention risk and weaker corporate governance systems. To shed light on previous inconclusive research, this paper investigates the topic further in a new country setting, that of Switzerland, because the previous results were mostly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. Switzerland is also one of the exemplary countries for executive compensation. Furthermore, it investigates the combined (cascaded) interaction effects of the board size and CEO duality on CEO compensation and market risk from the perspective of managerial power theory, which has not been previously analyzed in the literature to date. For the direct effect, in contrast to previous findings in Anglo-Saxon countries, it has been found that CEOs were not paid for market risk in Switzerland, which confirms agency theory's contracting prediction. This finding outlines the future comparative research area in this domain. For the combined interaction effect, it has been found that board size incorporated with CEO duality is the significant cascaded moderator, and large boards with CEO duality are significantly more effective in controlling asymmetric compensation, which confirms the efficacy of large boards with CEO duality in coping with asymmetric compensation and managerial entrenchment (managerial power theory). These results have both practical and academic implications for boards of directors, Human Resources and corporate governance literature, agency theory, and managerial power theory, by providing further evidence on previous inconclusive findings on board size, CEO duality, and the role of market risk in the CEO pay structure.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

The board of directors' behavioral dynamics can strongly influence an entrepreneurial firm's success. Drawing on the behavioral theory of corporate governance, this study identifies and tests factors that facilitate behavioral integration in boards of high technology start-ups. We unpack the black box of board behavior with primary data collected from a survey-based sample of 149 CEOs of Norwegian high-tech start-ups supplemented by quantitative archival information. We find that intra-board behavioral integration (i.e., board members' propensity to clearly understand one another's issues and needs, actively solve, and share relevant information and resources) is positively affected by greater levels of informal communication between CEOs and board members. Next, we find that inter-board trust (i.e., board members interact with absolute integrity, tell the truth at meetings, trust one another, and keep mutual promises) mediates this relationship such that higher levels of inter-board trust result in greater concordance between information communication frequency and inter-board behavioral integration. We then examine the role of an efficacious board chair who motivates and uses each board member's competence, formulates proposals for decisions and summarizes conclusions after board negotiation, and chairs board discussions without promoting their agenda, finding that efficacious board chair leadership moderates the relationship between informal communication frequency and intra-board trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by developing a new theory that explains Founder-CEOs' succession in family and non-family firms. Many scholars failed to generate a specific theory to describe the succession of Founder-CEOs. Family firms remain complex enterprises comprising interconnectedness of cultural interests in which corporate governance occurs by families, Founder-CEOs and sometimes a board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This study's design/methodology/approach reflects post-modernist epistemological and ontological perspectives for conducting systematic literature reviews. To identify relevant studies in the review, the several databases (Australian Business Dean's Council Journal Quality List; EBSCO Database, including PsycINFO and Psych studies; Web of Science) and a mix of ranked journals from entrepreneurship, management and psychology were used. Findings: The findings and results in this paper reflect the purpose, methodology and literature analysis culminating in 1,582 peer-reviewed studies. A total of 182 peer-reviewed studies met the criterion for review. Throughout the research process, a systematic literature review uncovered management literature gaps overlooked for decades during the theory-building process. Hence, developing a theory of Founder-CEOs succession used a combination of systematic, inductive, comparative and interactive approaches. Originality/value: A Theory of Founder-CEOs Succession explains the strategic process of replacing a founder systematically. The promotion of, and incentives for, internal executives have been topics of great interest and deliberation among scholars and practitioners for a long time. This study contributes research implications for theory building in the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by offering scholars and practitioners a theory that does not exist to describe Founder-CEOs' succession encompassing both strategic successes and failures. By incorporating successes and failures, this study provides realistic reflections of Founder-CEOs. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The research problem This study investigates the relationship between the incentive of Japanese non-profit organizations to avoid losing their tax-exempt status and the extent of tax-motivated expense allocation. Motivation Prior studies have shown that for joint overhead expenses, organizations can lower their tax burden by transferring costs from non-taxable to taxable activities. However, tax authorities may also investigate non-profits that report excessive profits without incurring expenses for non-taxable activities and penalize them by depriving them of their tax-exempt status. This deprivation of tax exemptions specific to non-profit organizations causes serious problems for such organizations in terms of the economic impact of increased income taxes and the loss of social value from donors. In Japan, non-profit organizations are deprived of tax-exempt status if the ratio of expenses from taxable activities to total expenses (TaxExpRatio) exceeds a regulatory threshold of 50%. We estimated the tax-motivated expense allocation and non-taxable activities, defining the term TaxExpRatio before the allocation as TRBA. In addition, we assumed that a larger board of directors has a stronger incentive to protect the non-profit's tax-exempt assets because individuals or organizations that provide resources to non-profits often become board members, who thus conduct stronger monitoring to avoid losing the tax-exempt status. The test hypotheses We hypothesized that when the TRBA exceeds the regulatory threshold, non-profits allocate less discretionary expense to taxable activities. We further posited that board size moderates the relationship between the TRBA exceeding the regulatory threshold and allocation of discretionary expenses to taxable activities. Target population We specifically considered the Japanese regulatory environment related to public-interest incorporated associations and foundations (PIIAs and PIIFs, referred to as Japanese non-profit organizations), which are tax-exempt organizations engaged in a wide range of public work. Adopted methodology We estimated the expense allocated from non-taxable to taxable activities in a non-profit organization based on Hofmann (2007) and Omer & Yetman (2007). We also estimated regressions using pooled cross-sectional and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Analysis By using 12,027 firm-year observations (4,763 distinct non-profit organizations in Japan), we estimated the regression model for the incentive to avoid losing tax-exempt status in non-profit organizations. Findings We found that non-profits with TRBA over the regulatory threshold tend to allocate less expenses to taxable activities. In addition, the empirical results show that the relationship between TRBA over the regulatory threshold and allocated expenses to taxable activities is moderated by board size. This finding suggests that larger boards in non-profit organizations are more incentivized to reduce tax avoidance behavior that may result in losing their tax-exempt status. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Conceptualization and research have addressed the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of top management teams and, independently, the effectiveness of alternative corporate governance structures. Those studies which do concurrently consider directors and management focus largely on the board's monitoring of the CEO. The interdependencies which exist among chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors necessitate an integrative approach which simultaneously considers these groups of strategic leaders. In this paper, we provide a rationale whereby a firm might elect a CEO or board dominance structure as compared to more balanced governance structures. We suggest that the efficacy of such choices may depend on several attendant conditions including the portfolio exposure and globalization of the firm, its ownership patterns (e.g., five percent owners, institutional investors, positions held by other corporations), and resource dependence and information requirements.

We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the post-restructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.

The paper compares the contribution, power and influence of non-executive directors and part-time chairpersons within large UK PLC's, using interview data collected for a pilot study. Two questions are addressed: What contribution, if any, is made by non-executive directors and part-time chairmen? How, if at all, do part-time chairpersons exercise power and influence? The paper reveals that part-time chairmen and non-executive directors claim to contribute to a broad range of issues, ranging from the strategy of the firm, to the appointment, selection and dismissal of board members. Contribution is made by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors converting power sources into influence. A variety of influence methods are used by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors to contribute as board members. Part-time chairmen influence most by assertiveness, using the authority that comes with leading the board. Non-executive directors influence most through persuasion and coalition formation. Non-executive directors less on their positional authority to exert influence, and more on their personal knowledge, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to form relationships with individuals both inside and outside of the boardroom.

This paper examines the factors influencing the relative weights placed on financial and non-financial performance measures in CEO bonus contracts. We find that the use of non-financial measures increases with the level of regulation, the extent to which the firm follows an innovation-oriented strategy, the adoption of strategic quality initiatives, and the noise in financial measures. We find no evidence that the choice of performance measures in bonus contracts is associated with the level of financial distress or the value of CEO equity holdings relative to salary and bonus. Our results also provide no support for the hypothesis that CEOs with greater influence over the board of directors are more likely to be compensated based on non-financial measures.

CEOs who jointly serve as board chairs have been the focus of considerable controversy of late. Powerful organizational constituents including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York City Pension Fund have targeted firms that rely on the joint structure. These shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair. Governance activists have made similar recommendations, most notably in the Cadbury Report, a governance reform document written in the United Kingdom. The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers. Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern. More than 80 percent of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair. They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community. Accordingly, we pose the question: Does board leadership structure matter? Specifically, we focus on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts. Our analysis leads us to conclude while there may, at times, be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions (e.g., financial distress; weak board of directors), to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort.

The new human resources (HR) function represents a move away from an administrative, reactionary role towards a more strategic, proactive, planning position. The current research surveyed members of the Australian Human Resource Institute to determine, first, whether these changes are actually taking place in Australia and, second, to provide a profile of those involved in the area in order to analyse how well the function is equipped to deal with this period of transition. Results show that change is apparent. Departments are now called 'human resource' departments rather than 'personnel', and the HR function enjoys improved status. Representation on boards of directors is poor but there is evidence of committees of senior executives meeting regularly to discuss HR matters. Responses also suggest balanced involvement of line managers in HR initiatives. Change is also evident in the profile of those involved in the HR area. Gender equity has been achieved and the group is more highly qualified than it was in 1985. Areas of concern include reduced salary levels, the non-representation of women in the higher salary group, careful monitoring of younger people to ensure that they get access to a broad range of business experiences within the organization, and retention of those involved in the HR area who understand the culture and strategic vision of the firm.

Many corporate governance observers agree that when firms encounter dramatically changed competitive environments, the board of directors may become involved in the strategy formation process. Based on Finkelstein and Hambrick's (Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D., 1996. Strategic leadership: top executives and their effects on organizations. West, Minneapolis, MN.) conceptual model, we examine the effects of the board of directors and executive committee characteristics on the degree of internationalization of the U.S. telecommunications industry during the 12 years after AT&T's 1984 divestiture. We also examine the effects of the regulatory environment and core business growth on the degree on internationalization during this time. We find support linking executive committee characteristics and regulatory environment to the degree of internationalization. Characteristics of the entire board are consistently found to be insignificant. (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

Incentive or performance contingent compensation plans are rapidly becoming the norm in corporate America, as boards of directors attempt to make executives more accountable to shareholders. However, incentive plans also expose executives to risk, and may also impart a short-term bias on their decision-making processes. This article suggests that the tension between the pressures for accountability and long-term decision making can be managed by aligning firm strategy with an incentive plan that is based on an appropriate performance criteria.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.

Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.

An examination of 165 top management successions in U.S. firms during 1989-91 reveals that external successions are more likely in small firms, in firms with poor economic performance, and in firms which offer the successor several top positions (for example, Chairman and CEO). This last finding illustrates that successor's interests and demands (such as organizational power) are also important in determining the final match between manager and firm. We also find that, on average, the postsuccession performance of external successors is superior to that of internal successors. This could indicate that the Board of Directors faces an agency problem, leading it to appoint too often from inside.

The primary aim of this paper is to explore the relevance and applicability of leadership research in enhancing our understanding of boards of directors' functioning and effectiveness. Secondly, to discuss methodological issues with respect to board research and indicate potentially fruitful methodological approaches. It is suggested that the leadership research stream focused on traits and competencies is particularly promising for future research on boards, since it has been demonstrated that there are traits that can distinguish leaders from non-leaders or effective leaders from ineffective ones; as well as that certain competencies can distinguish superior performers from average performers in particular jobs. Moreover, it is proposed that a promising way forward in terms of methodology is to focus on gathering in-depth qualitative longitudinal data of actual board behaviours based on observation, and to inform quantitative research by such in-depth data in order to enhance the operationalisation of theoretical variables, as well as identifying the critical variables in the first place.

Most current work on Boards of Directors has been focused on what can be considered best practices for effective governance in terms of roles, composition, process and style. Furthermore, this literature can be divided among very practically oriented managerial work, and more rigorous, theoretically based work. Most of the empirical research in this area has been centered on Anglo-Saxon countries. Some European countries, like Spain, have a very different governance tradition. Given this context, our present work deals with two complementary objectives: 1. To ascertain the current status of governance practices in Spain. 2. To obtain evidence about which of these practices may be associated with effective governance.

This study describes the survival cases of two local savings banks in Finland during fundamental changes in 1990's when 90% of the Finnish Savings Bank Group did not survive. Survival is studied through the roles of the non-executive boards and the CEOs in the context of three change periods. Institutional theory is used as a framework in describing and explaining the survival. The cases describe how radical renewals can be made despite dominant actors and generally agreed ways of change in the field. It is suggested that the CEO and the non-executive board of directors were in a key role in changing the future of a local savings bank. Old institutions can die, but the active role of the small banks themselves was decisive; by taking active role they recreated and renewed their organizations (c.f. Greenwood and Hinings 1996).

The coefficient of variation (V) is a statistical measure commonly used for comparing diversity in work groups. It has been employed by organizational researchers to index the relative internal variability of top-management teams, task groups, boards of directors, departments, and other social aggregates on numerous dimensions. Commenting on its widespread application, this article reviews cautions and pitfalls associated with its use for this purpose. Research implications associated with using V are also discussed.

This paper builds a model of the effects of agency risk and procedural justice in the boards of directors of venture capital-backed firms. Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

This study investigates the influence of growth potential on corporate governance mechanisms. Results suggest that firms with high growth potential make greater use of managerial equity ownership and long term incentives and have higher proportions of insiders on their boards of directors. The findings are congruent with the argument that firms with high growth potential make use of more flexible, future-oriented mechanisms of corporate governance.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors are coming under increasing scrutiny, both in the wake of a number of serious corporate frauds and failures and through a more general debate about the nature of corporate governance and its role in achieving national competitiveness. Though research on boards is growing, there remains a lack of empirical studies on the perceptions of directors themselves as to their role and influence in the running of organizations, and in particular the strategic process. This article responds to widespread calls for direct study of boards of directors by using a multi-method approach involving an in-depth examination of 51 directors of UK public companies, a survey of 121 company secretaries and four case studies of UK plcs, where multiple board members were interviewed. Through the use of a grounded methodology, this article examines the impact of boards on strategy and shows that by establishing the business definition, gatekeeping, selecting directors, and confidence building, the board influences the boundaries of strategic action. Evidence for the managerial domination of boards was slight, but the results showed support for a number of theoretical frameworks, suggesting that multiple perspectives are required to fully understand the nature of board activity.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

The empirical relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, the investment opportunity set (IOS) and corporate governance mechanisms is analyzed for a sample of 415 Canadian firms in 1997. Results indicate that firms with high IOS pay higher levels of total compensation to their CEOs. In addition, CEOs of high IOS derive a larger proportion of their compensation from performance-contingent forms of pay such as bonuses, stock option grants and long-term incentive plans. However, CEOs with weak boards of directors are compensated more than CEOs with powerful boards. Contrary to our expectation, we find that in high IOS firms with weak boards of directors, CEOs seek to have higher proportions of contingent forms of pay in their compensation. An implication of this result is that contingent compensation practices may be a more value-enhancing form of remuneration for CEOs. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

In this article we investigated the degree to which nonprofit organizations have developed succession plans and to what degree there is room at the top for insiders to succeed incumbents. Twelve nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) within a major urban center in the northeastern portion of the USA served as our sample. CEOs responded to a questionnaire and were interviewed to collect personal and organizational data. Findings included that most of the organizations did not have succession plans; boards of directors, not incumbent CEOs, appointed successors, except in the case of founders; and despite the fact that insiders are provided with leadership training, they are often not promoted to the position of CEO. Implication for leadership and organization development and recommendations for future research are made. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

In this study, we investigate how board of directors' attributes influence CEO compensation among the firms comprising the TSE 150 index.

Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.

We examine, both theoretically and empirically, top-management compensation in the presence of agency conflicts when shareholders have delegated governance responsibilities to a self-interested Board of Directors (BOD). We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.

A matched sample methodology was utilized to detect ownership and management differences between first generation and multi-generation independent unquoted family companies in the UK. Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in first generation and multi-generation companies were generally drawn from the family owning the company. Both types of companies also had small management teams. Several statistically significant differences were detected. CEOs served longer apprenticeships in multi-generation rather than first generation companies. Multi-generation rather than first generation companies were more likely to employ managers drawn from the family owning the company. In other respects, multi-generation companies generally appeared to be better managed than first generation companies. Multi-generation companies had larger boards of directors. Moreover, a larger proportion of multi-generation rather than first generation companies employed a non-executive director. Owners of both types of family companies, but particularly the owners of first generation companies may be 'control averse'. Many first generation companies (and some multi-generation companies) associated with a shallower managerial pool had failed to address this potential managerial and strategic weakness by selective use of 'outside' managerial expertise. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.

This article examines the compensation of top managers of nonprofits in the United States using panel data from tax returns of the organizations from 1992 to 1996. Studying managers in nonprofits is particularly interesting given the difficulty in measuring performance. The article examines many areas commonly studied in the executive pay (within for-profit firms) literature. It explores pay differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms, pay variability within and across nonprofit industries, managerial pay and performance (including organization size and fund raising) in nonprofits, the effect of government grants on managerial pay, and the relationship between boards of directors and managerial pay in nonprofits.

We study the long-term stock performance of initial public offerings (IPOs). We examine how past performance affects the board of directors' stability and how changes in boards affect subsequent performance. We introduce a dynamic, scale invariant stability metric to measure such changes. Our results indicate that among IPO firms, those with poorer initial performance experience greater board instability and that greater board stability is associated with improvement in subsequent performance. These results indicate that board members leave poorly performing firms, rather than shareholders replacing ineffective boards. Retaining boards that experience initial good performance is associated with continued success.

Although scholars have studied outside executive succession for decades, there is still no clear definition of the term "outsider". We focus on a new dimension of outsiderness, the industrial background of executives hired from outside the firm into a CEO position. This paper examines the antecedents of boards' decisions on the industry origin of outside successors as well as the short-term stock market response. We find that firms with more independent boards and with blockholders owning large amounts of stock are more likely to hire industry unrelated successors. However, the board's decision does not strictly follow the rhetoric of stockholder's interests. The stock market reacts more positively to outside CEO succession announcements when the CEO comes from an industry related firm. These findings support our theoretical arguments that the boards of directors may use a logic or rule of appropriateness in deciding the industrial origin of outside successors.

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

This study examines the relationship between demographic diversity on boards of directors with firm financial performance. This relationship is examined using 1993 and 1998 financial performance data (return on asset and investment) and the percentage of women and minorities on boards of directors for 127 large US companies. Correlation and regression analyses indicate board diversity is positively associated with these financial indicators of firm performance. Implications for both strategic human resource management and future research are discussed.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

White-collar crime can cost a company from 1 percent to 6 percent of annual sales, yet little is known about the organizational conditions that can reduce this cost. Previous governance research has examined the link between block holders, boards of directors, or CEO compensation and fraud. In this study, these traditional measures of governance are found to have little impact. Instead, operational governance, including clarity of policies and procedures, formal cross-company communication, and performance-based pay for the board and for more employees, significantly reduces the likelihood of a crime commission.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors and their monitoring committees (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the full board and its monitoring committees, and a greater proportion of independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the full board. Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on full board and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that full board independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture. (c) 2003 Wiley. All rights reserved.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

This study examines the relationship between top management team duality and the decision to release false financial information. Using a matched sample of 103 firms that were convicted of issuing fraudulent financial statements in the period from 1992 to 1996, the results show that this form of illegal corporate behavior is more likely to occur when there is a concentration of power in the hands of insiders. For these firms, insiders control the top management team and the Board of Directors by simultaneously occupying the key managerial positions of clout within the firm while also sitting on the Board (duality), and through their ownership interest in the firm.

Regulators argue that mandated compensation disclosure improves corporate governance by permitting shareholders to enjoin boards of directors to reward executives in ways that are consistent with shareholder value creation. We posit that mandated compensation disclosure, or the absence thereof, has a greater impact on the CEO compensation practices of widely held firms than of closely held firms. More specifically, we expect that, in the absence of mandated disclosure, CEO compensation is likely to be less performance-contingent among widely held firms than among closely held firms. Moreover, we also expect that the advent of mandated disclosure leads widely held firms to increase the extent to which CEO compensation is performance-contingent, much more so than closely held firms would. We use a unique data base resulting from the Ontario Securities Commission amendment of regulation 638 in October 1993. For the first time, this amendment required firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange to provide detailed executive compensation data similar to those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the current year as well as retroactively for the previous two years. We find that, in the absence of mandated disclosure, CEO cash compensation in widely held firms is less performance-contingent than in closely held firms. With the imposition of mandated disclosure, performance-contingent cash compensation increases more in widely held firms than in closely held firms. Results with respect to stock option grants are mixed, with both closely held and widely held firms reacting to the advent of mandated disclosure.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

The size, characteristics and structure of boards of directors have been claimed to be an important influence on the performance of large firms, but have been less examined in small firms. For larger firms the role of boards acts more as a substitute for the development of internal staff and management skills, indicating that for large firms directors chiefly support the control role of CEOs. The importance of seeing boards, external consultants and internal management skills as substitutes is demonstrated, and is shown to have a non-linear relation with firm size. However, a key finding of the paper is that there is little evidence of a strong association of board size, board qualifications, or board structure with firm performance, measured by profitability, employment growth or propensity to innovate.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

The board of directors is the cornerstone of any effective corporate governance system. A well- structured board can effectively monitor and motivate management of a company for the benefit of the company's shareholders. This paper investigates the relationship between board structure and firm performance using a sample of 490 publicly listed firms in China. The characteristics of board structure we examined include: board size, inside/outside/independent directors, CEO/Chair duality, stock holdings of directors, rewards to directors and aged directors. We find significant relationship between firm performance and three characteristics: the rewards to director, the stock holdings of directors and the existence of independent directors. We also find political influences on the effectiveness of boards. When state ownership is more than 50% (state-dominating), rewards and stock holdings of directors are useful. When state ownership is less than 50% (non-state-dominating), the existence of independent directors comes into effect. In addition, our analyses indicate that state ownership affects firm performance. State ownership is positively related to firm performance in state-dominating groups while negatively related to firm performance in non-state-ownership groups.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

We develop theoretical arguments from the efficiency wage model (Shapiro & Stiglitz, 1984) to provide better understanding of Fama's (1980) seminal notion that executive labor markets contribute to the alignment of executive and shareholder interests. We show how the efficiency wage model can be integrated with several other theories of executive turnover. Furthermore, the model allows for predictions that have received very little analysis to date, such as the effect of firm risk and executive salaries on turnover. We test predictions from the model on a sample of executives from 280 manufacturing firms observed annually from 1986 to 1992. Our sample includes data on over 12,000 observations and nearly 1,700 employment terminations. The results are consistent with the main predictions of the efficiency wage model. Holding performance constant, boards of directors are less patient with (more likely to dismiss) executives who have lower salaries and those in higher risk firms. (c) 2004 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This study empirically examines the association between certain director characteristics and the extent of voluntary audit committee disclosure in annual reports. Results suggest that Singapore's publicly traded firms are more likely to voluntarily disclose audit committee related information as: the number of board members increases different individuals occupy the roles of CEO and board chairperson the proportion of independent directors serving on the board increases. Findings, however, fail to show any association between the amount of voluntary audit committee disclosure and the percentage of executive directors' ownership. Documented findings are of interest and benefit to various parties including regulators, corporate governance reformists, and corporate management. For instance, findings imply that a positive by-product of implementing major corporate governance reforms currently championed by corporate governance reformists will be an increase in audit committee disclosures. As a result, there will be less pressure on regulators to develop, introduce, and enforce mandatory audit committee disclosures that may be potentially intrusive to a firm's management.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

This paper examines the role of boards of directors in light of institutional contingencies and recent best practice governance guidelines and regulation such as the United Kingdom Higgs Review and the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. Particular attention is paid to discussing the role of independent directors across countries, and the implications for corporate governance innovation. It concludes by posing questions about recent corporate governance transformations and providing suggestions for future research. (c) 2005 British Academy of Management.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the effects of board of directors' network characteristics on firm performance using a sample of 199 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1990 through 1999. Two board network characteristics are discussed, namely: board network density and board external social capital. Board network density is defined as the extensiveness or the cohesiveness of contact among the members of board of directors, and board external social capital refers to the degree to which board members have outside contacts in the external environment. The test results suggest that a moderate level of board network density enhances firm value, while too cohesive a board network destroys it. It is also found that board members' elite school networks were positively associated with firm performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

There has been a considerable literature on the determinants of why firms undertake foreign direct investment (FDI), but very little on whether firms with different governance characteristics are more or less likely to venture overseas. For example, are family-controlled firms more predisposed to FDI than firms, with similar attributes, but different forms of ownership? Does the presence of institutional shareholders suggest a greater propensity to invest abroad? Does the composition of the Board of Directors have an impact? Most extant studies of corporate governance focus on the impact of governance factors on firm performance. However, these performance outcomes are a function of the strategic decisions made by the firms, which suggests it might be useful to consider the relationship between corporate governance factors and particular strategic decisions. One example is the decision to undertake foreign direct investment. The two main strands of IB literature on the determinants of FDI have little or nothing to say about how corporate governance factors might affect the FDI decision. Both internalisation theory and the resource-based view see FDI primarily as a means by which firms can appropriate rents in overseas markets from the exploitation of their idiosyncratic resources and capabilities. This paper extends this literature by investigating the effects of governance factors on the decision to undertake FDI. In particular, we want to assess the impact upon the FDI decision of (a) the extent of family control, (b) the presence of domestic and foreign institutional shareholders, and (c) the composition of the Board of Directors. We investigate these effects using a sample of 228 publicly listed firms in Taiwan, and our results clearly indicate that family control and share ownership by domestic financial institutions in Taiwanese firms are associated with the decision to undertake FDI. We also find that corporate governance impacts in different ways with regard to Taiwanese FDI in China in comparison to Taiwanese FDI in the rest of the world. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are important engines to stimulate the economic growth of a country. The survival of these firms is partly dependent on their human capital availability. Using strategic leadership theory, this paper examines the characteristics of the entrepreneur/manager, the top management team and the board of directors in Dutch SMEs. Empirical data identifies the entrepreneurs/managers as the most important decision makers. However, to support their decision-making process in the current competitive business environment, two thirds of the CEOs have created top management teams. CEOs and top management team executives combine their industry and functional knowledge to create the necessary firm know-how. Less than half of the firms have adopted a supervisory board. A reason for this could be the CEO's limited knowledge on the concept of governance. The paper concludes that entrepreneurs/managers of SMEs should be made aware of the strategic knowledge and networking advantages both top-management team and supervisory board members can offer.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

The board of directors is generally seen as an important internal governance structure. However, the empirical evidence on the board-performance relationship is not conclusive. On the other hand, a growing literature suggests that different control mechanisms, either internal or external to the firm, can interact with each other and affect performance. One such important factor is product market competition. The objective of the study is to investigate further the board-performance relationship taking into consideration the potential effect of market competition. More precisely, the study analyzes the combined effect of boards of directors' characteristics, and market discipline on firm performance. Overall, the results suggest that, competition has a positive and significant impact on firm profitability and productivity. Moreover, this determinant factor creates the conditions for which the board-performance relationship is supported. In other words, for boards to be effective, firms should be exposed to a competitive environment. (c) Blackwcll Publishing Ltd. 2005.

Past literature in board research has centred on board structure and company performance. Over the years, empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between these two variables (Dalton and Daily, 1999. Across the Board, March, 28-32). Until recently, the literature on board processes has been sparse. The reason for insufficient empirical work on board processes possibly is due to the difficulty of gaining access to boards. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model and tested the model on publicly listed companies in Singapore. Based on a sample of 212 company responses and 299 directors, we conclude that board structure does not affect board process while board process is related to board performance. In terms of individual parameters, effort norms, cognitive conflict and the presence and usage of skills are positively related to board roles and board transparency. Also, affective and process conflicts are negatively related to board roles and board transparency. Finally, board process does not mediate the relationship between board structure and board performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Empirical literature on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different studies in the Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration and the board of directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of managerial controls, in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.

The Canadian Securities Administrators' National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Policy"),1 released 15 April 2005, on which the author provided detailed advice, reads that: "[t]he board should develop clear position descriptions for the chair and the chair of each board committee" (section 3.5); the board should engage in an explicit two-step "competencies and skills" recruitment of individual directors (sections 3.12 and 3.14);2 and individual directors should be regularly assessed and that these assessments should consider "the applicable position description(s), as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is expected to bring to the board" (section 3.18). The Canadian Securities Administrators, subject to receiving the required approvals, intend for the Policy to come into force in Canadian jurisdictions on 30 June 2005. This article canvasses some of the aspects in assessing board leadership. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

Embedded within firms are unique stores of intangible human assets that likely influence the way firms compete. We argue that the human and social capital of a firm, particularly at the upper echelon and board of director (BOD) levels, contribute to the firm's awareness of the competitive environment and its motivation and ability to undertake numerous, complex, and forceful competitive actions. We also suggest that the firm's executive compensation systems moderate the effects of these intangible human assets on firm competitive behavior. By examining how human capital, intra-firm social capital, and executive compensation influence firm competitive behavior, we advance a strategic HRM perspective of firm competitive behavior and outline several implications for future research.

This article focuses attention on executive level leadership. It identifies the central issues involved in the study of leadership at this level. It also constructs an agenda for future research for this echelon. Despite the massive growth in activity directed towards leadership development, little of this has been directed at the top level; instead most activity has been focused on junior and middle levels of organizational leadership. A distinction is drawn between 'leadership in organizations' and 'leadership of organizations'. The former can be taken to refer to team leadership and the latter to overall leadership, which includes responsibility for setting the mission and designing the architecture of the organization. This article does not deny the importance of continued research in the former area, but it does argue that more attention needs to be directed towards the study of 'organizational leadership' - denoting in this usage executive leadership or strategy-level leadership. The central quest thus becomes to identify the critical issues which relate specifically or especially to leadership at this level. Three key interrelated themes are identified: structural/relational issues; functional issues; and legitimacy issues. (c) 2005, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors in the Tunisian context. We model the composition of the board of directors as a function of alternative governance mechanisms, some board characteristics and other control variables. On a sample of 97 Tunisian firms, we find evidence that the proportion of outsiders on the board of directors is positively associated with large block, institutional and overseas ownerships, and board size. We document that the CEO duality is associated with a decrease in the board independence. We fail to find an evidence that increased debt ratio to total assets is inversely associated with the outside board representation. While we predict a positive relationship between the board independence and the firm size, the organizational complexity and the quotation status; our results generally do not support this conjecture.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This study, which examines the association between board monitoring and the level of voluntary disclosure, finds new evidence that firms with a higher proportion of independent directors on the board are associated with higher levels of voluntary disclosure. Although board size and CEO duality are not associated with voluntary disclosure, boards with a majority of independent directors have significantly higher levels of voluntary disclosure than firms with balanced boards. Notably, we find that the presence of an external governance mechanism, the regulatory environment, enhances the strength of the association between the proportion of independent directors and the level of voluntary disclosure. This association is some two to three times greater under a "disclosure-based" regulatory regime than under a "merit-based" regulatory regime. (c) 2006 University of Illinois.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempts to find a relationship between boards of directors and firm performance. This paper critically examines the premise on which this research is based. An expectations gap approach is applied for the first time to implicit expectations which assume a relationship between firm performance and company boards. An expectations gap has two elements: a reasonableness gap and a performance gap. Seven aspects of boards are identified as leading to a reasonableness gap. Five aspects of boards are identified as leading to a performance gap. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for empirically testing some of the concepts discussed in this paper.

Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking "strategy consistency" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - There has been increasing interest in Australia regarding corporate boards, their role and the contribution they make to organisations' performance and success. There is however, a gap in our knowledge about what board members do. To better understand boards, we need to know more about the behaviour of those who sit on boards. Many chairmen and all non-executive directors serve on corporate boards in a part-time capacity, however, such part-time service does not negate a role in strategy. The purpose of this paper is to ask how, if at all, do part-time board members influence strategy in Australian public companies? Design/methodology/approach - This paper first examines the literature on choice, change and control as key aspects of firms' strategic conduct. Second, attention turns to generating empirical data to examine how part-time board members engage with these processes. Attention is given to the actions of part-time board members vis-a-vis executive directors, both inside and outside the boardroom. Data from interviews with 20 board members are interpreted using the 1999 framework of McNulty and Pettigrew which conceptualises part-time board members' involvement in strategy as: "taking strategic decisions", "shaping strategic decisions" and "shaping the content, context and conduct of strategy". Findings - Each of the three levels of part-time board member involvement in strategy described by McNulty and Pettigrew engage part-time board members in processes of choice, change and control in differing ways. Part-time board members are able to shape both the ideas that form the content of corporations' strategies and the methodologies and processes by which those ideas evolve. In so doing, part-time board members are capable of exerting control over management and influencing processes of strategic choice and change. Boards of directors have a role in strategy formulation, strategic decision-making and strategic control. Practical implications - The board's role is in the driver's seat not as a rubber stamp. A process whereby board members can engage and exert a controlling influence over strategic direction and outcomes of the corporation is of benefit not only to Australian corporations but has global corporate benefit. Originality/value - This paper describes and analyzes the contribution to strategy made by board members in five Australian companies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The paper aims to examine the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in China. Design/methodology/approach - Using an OLS-regression model to test the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and the level of voluntary disclosure. The sample is based on 559 firm observations in 2002. Findings - Higher blockholder ownership and foreign listing/shares ownership is associated with increased disclosure. However, managerial ownership, state ownership, and legal-person ownership are not related to disclosure. An increase in independent directors increases corporate disclosure and CEO duality is associated with lower disclosure. The paper also finds that larger firms had greater disclosure, while firms with growth opportunities are reluctant to disclose information voluntarily. Research limitations/implications - Firstly, the sample iscomprised of companies listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2002 and only 45.7 percent of representative firms listed in China. Secondly, the disclosure checklist does not cover all voluntary disclosure in corporations as employed and supported in several prior studies. Thirdly, the award of checklist items may be subjected to errors. Practical implications - This paper indicates the relationship among ownership structure, board composition and corporate voluntary disclosure, and provides evidence for Chinese regulators to improve corporate governance and optimize ownership structure. Originality/value - Distinct from prior empirical research based on disclosure behavior in developed-western markets, this study examines the impact of ownership structure and board composition on voluntary disclosures of listed companies in the Asian setting of China.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

Recent US corporate governance reforms introduced extensive regulations and guidelines for public corporations, particularly corporate boards. This article evaluates the extent to which empirical research on corporate boards and firm performance supports these reforms. Building on the meta-analysis conducted by Zahra and Pearce (1989), we review 105 studies published between 1989 and 2005. We find most of the practices mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the regulations issued by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, had not been subject to prior study. Where board characteristics have been studied, we find limited guidance for policymakers on identifying governance practices that result in more effective firm performance. In an effort to increase the relevance of future research on boards and firm performance, we provide a framework on corporate boards. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Research suggests that a strong and vigilant board can have a significant influence on the value-creating potential of medium-size companies. Yet, how best to conceptualize this relationship remains controversial.The mainstream approach has been to argue for a direct relationship between board demography and company performance. In opposition stands a growing number of scholars who argue that boards' ability to perform board tasks effectively - their actual behaviour - should be taken into account. Empirical studies comparing the two approaches are however surprisingly scarce. Based on this observation, the aim of the study is to test the influence of boards of directors on CEOs' commitment to take an entrepreneurial posture. Both demographic and behavioural board measures are included in the model. Statistical analysis on a sample of 175 medium-size manufacturing companies gives ample support for the behavioural approach. The study ends with a discussion of the results and suggestions for further research. (c) SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.

This paper examines the factors that affect the activity of the audit committees in Spain. The data used in the analyses are collected from the Spanish stock market in 2003. The results show the existence of a non-linear relationship between the managerial stock ownership and the activity of the audit committee. We have also verified the existence of a lower audit committee's activity in highly leveraged firms and when the ownership structure is concentrated in the hands of large shareholders. The large firms have more active committees than small firms. Finally, we have not found any evidence of a significant influence of the composition of the board or the audit committee on the activity of the latter. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

Decisions by boards of directors can have a critical impact on the success or failure of a firm. These decisions range from the hiring and firing of a CEO to market entry and exit to the way in which a firm reports accounting profits and losses. In seeking to understand boards of directors more fully, we have come to think that we need a more complete picture of intraboard relationships among directors, including but not limited to relationships with the CEO, because these relationships affect critical decisions for the firm. The authors propose that the study of boards of directors could benefit by using a conceptual lens that scholars have yet to apply to this setting-that of the board as a social network unto itself.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the independence of audit committees is affected by the degree of control exerted by managers over the board of directors. Results from a sample of 75 listed Spanish companies show that the majority of firms that voluntarily adopted an audit committee between 1998 and 2001, made an effort to guarantee their independence from management. The degree of independence is shown to be determined by the proportion of inside directors on the board, the same person holding both the CEO and board chairperson positions, and the level of management ownership. These findings may have political implications because existing regulations do not limit the presence of inside directors on audit committees. The presence of inside directors may compromise effectiveness, turning audit committees into instruments of management to provide the appearance of monitoring.

Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the gender composition and structure of the board of directors in not-for-profit organisations and their relation to firm-level entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey sent to Swedish riding schools. The paper focuses on not-for-profit associations and the analysis is based on 60 respondents. The data were analysed by multivariate methods. Findings The overall gender composition of boards had no influence on firm-level entrepreneurship. However, a high proportion of women in powerful positions were found to have a positive influence on one of the study's two dimensions of firm-level entrepreneurship, i.e. strategic opportunism. No influence concerning gender in powerful positions was found on risk taking, the other dimension of firm-level entrepreneurship. Originality/value The attention to gender composition not only focuses on the board at large, but also highlights the specific positions of the chairperson, secretary and treasurer in the board structure. Another valuable insight concerns firm-level entrepreneurship, here treated as a two-dimensional concept, consisting of strategic opportunism and risk taking, which finds support in the analysis. Further, the empirical data were collected from an industry that includes a high proportion of women on the boards, i.e. the Swedish riding school industry. The study contributes to the debate concerning the gender composition on the board of directors where a high proportion of women in powerful positions is positively related with strategic opportunism.

Until the mid-1990s, the study of initial public offerings (IPOs) fell mainly under the purview of the finance literature. Within the last 10 years, however, management and entrepreneurship scholars have delved more into this subject area, as well. This article summarizes research examining IPO firms that has appeared in management and entrepreneurship journals, highlighting in particular the influence of individuals (namely executives and boards of directors) on IPO firm outcomes.

Although the Combined Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, 2006) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of PLC board members, current academic literature offers little guidance to FTSE 250 boards - many of whom are managing different Issues compared with their FTSE 100 counterparts including high corporate growth, existing founder and/or family board members, and/or newly formed boards - on ways In which they can improve the quality of decision-making, increase individual board contribution, and enhance overall board performance and effectiveness. This paper attempts to outline the key issues faced by board members, particularly non-executive directors, serving on FTSE 250 company boards with regard to three distinct roles-strategy, succession planning and risk management - and examines the relevant influences on board members derived from corporate lifecycle, board structure, existing process and board culture which affect board performance and standards of corporate governance. Its conclusions draw on the author's previous research on non-executive contribution (Long, 2004) and her recent experience of reviewing performance and effectiveness of FTSE 100 and 250 boards of directors through Boardroom Review.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

This chapter describes how to use popular software programs (Hierarchical Linear Modeling, LISREL) to analyze multiwave panel data. We review prevailing methods for panel data analyzes in strategic management research and identify their limitations. Then, we explain how multilevel and latent growth modeling provide more rigorous methodologies for studying dynamic phenomena. We present an example illustrating how firm performance can initiate temporal change in the human and social capital of members of Board of Directors, using hierarchical linear modeling. With the same data set, we replicate this test with first-order factor latent growth modeling (LGM). Next, we explain how to use second-order factor LGM with panel data on employee cognitions. Finally, we review the relative advantages and disadvantages of these new data-analytical approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent corporate scandals have put company boards in the spotlight. Legislation, codes of conduct, and guidelines have been developed to improve corporate governance. But while many prescriptions for improving corporate governance focus on the structure of boards, Dr. Richard Leblanc's research suggests that there is no direct causal relationship between board structure and corporate performance. Indeed, many recent failed corporations had exemplary board structure. Richard Leblanc discusses how to assess board effectiveness and improve it. Copyright (c) 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study provides empirical evidence that firms with larger boards have lower variability of corporate performance. The results indicate that board size is negatively associated with the variability of monthly stock returns, annual accounting return on assets, Tobin's Q, accounting accruals, extraordinary items, analyst forecast inaccuracy, and R&D spending, the level of R&D expenditures, and the frequency of acquisition and restructuring activities. The results are consistent with the view that it takes more compromises for a larger board to reach consensus, and consequently, decisions of larger boards are less extreme, leading to less variable corporate performance.

Agency-based studies of boards of directors address factors relevant to board vigilance with respect to the monitoring of senior managers. We argue that relying solely on director vigilance may be limiting because vigilance without relevant experience is unlikely to ensure board effectiveness. Our contention is that boards comprising vigilant directors, as well as directors with appropriate knowledge gained through experience, not only will be better monitors, but also more useful advisors to top managers. The focus of our study is on the effect on acquisition outcomes of the interaction of board vigilance and director experiential learning. Consistent with our expectations, the empirical findings indicate that vigilant boards rich in appropriate experience are associated with superior acquisition outcomes.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Why are some newly appointed CEOs (i.e., those with tenure of three years or less) dismissed while others are not? Drawing upon previous reseach on information asymmetry and adverse selection in CEO selection, I argue that the board of directors may make a poor selection at the time of CEO succession, and as a result, must dismiss the appointee after succession when better information about him/her is obtained. Therefore, the level of information asymmetry at the time of succession increases the likelihood of dismissal. With data on 204 newly appointed CEOs, the results of this study support this argument. After controlling for alternative explanations of CEO dismissal (e.g., firm performance and political factors), the results show that the likelihood of dismissal of newly appointed CEOs is higher in outside successions and/or if the succession follows the dismissal of the preceding CEO. Further, if at the time of succession, the firm's board has a nominating committee that is independent and/or on which outside directors have few external directorships, the likelihood of dismissal is lower. Contributions to the CEO dismissal/succession literature are discussed. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between the compensation of the top five executives at a set of over 400 publicly listed Canadian firms and various internal and external corporate governance-related factors. The media is full of stories suggesting a relationship between large executive compensation packages and failures in governance at various levels within organisations, but there exists little formal analysis of many of these relationships. Our analysis provides empirical evidence supporting some of these assertions, refuting others and documenting new relationships. We find that variances in internal governance related to differences across firms in the characteristics of the CEO, compensation committee and board of directors do influence both the level and composition of executive compensation, especially for the CEO. Considering external measures of corporate governance, we find that different types of shareholders and competitive environments impact executive compensation. We do not find that either the internal or external governance characteristics dominate. (c) 2008 The Author.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This study seeks to provide valuable new insight into the timeliness of corporate internet reporting (TCIR) by a sample of Irish-listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply an updated version of Abdelsalam et al. TCIR index to assess the timeliness of corporate internet reporting. The index encompasses 13 criteria that are used to measure the TCIR for a sample of Irish-listed companies. In addition, the authors assess the timeliness of posting companies' annual and interim reports to their web sites. Furthermore, the study examines the influence of board independence and ownership structure on the TCIR behaviour. Board composition is measured by the percentage of independent directors, chairman's dual role and average tenure of directors. Ownership structure is represented by managerial ownership and blockholder ownership. Findings - It is found that Irish-listed companies, on average, satisfy only 46 per cent of the timeliness criteria assessed by the timeliness index. After controlling for size, audit fees and firm performance, evidence that TCIR is positively associated with board of director's independence and chief executive officer (CEO) ownership is provided. Furthermore, it is found that large companies are faster in posting their annual reports to their web sites. The findings suggest that board composition and ownership structure influence a firm's TCIR behaviour, presumably in response to the information asymmetry between management and investors and the resulting agency costs. Practical implications - The findings highlight the need for improvement in TCIR by Irish-listed companies in many areas, especially in regard to the regular updates of information provided on their web sites. Originality/value - This study represents one of the first comprehensive examinations of the important dimension of the TCIR in Irish-listed companies. (c) 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the views of directors of public-listed Australian companies regarding the role of the independent director and the significance of that role in relationship to the composition of the board of company directors. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study using a grounded research approach was used and 30 directors of Australian public-listed companies were interviewed. Findings - The analysis indicates that participating directors were convinced that a majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) provided a safeguard for a balance of power in the board/management relationship. The difference between NEDs, who are also independent directors, and NEDs who are not independent, was highlighted as an important distinction. The capacity for board members to think independently was seen to be enhanced, but not necessarily ensured, with majority membership of NEDs. However, a majority of independent minds expressing multiple points of view was perceived to reduce the board room hazard of "group think." Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted within the context of the preferred model for board composition in Australian public-listed companies which requires a majority of NEDs. Originality/value - Conflicting evidence surrounding the claim that a majority of independent members in the board structure contributes to "best pratice governance" makes the paper relevant to governance issues being debated in the global arena.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Purpose - Past literature on board research has centred on board structure and firm performance. Since empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between the two, attention has shifted towards board role performance. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper examines three conceptual models for the studying of board role performance: structure, process, and mediation. Findings - Current literature provides little consensus as to the specific configuration for effective board role performance. Originality/value - First, the study examines various aspects of board role performance. This is in contrast with previous research which largely investigates board role performance in general or under the dominant agency perspective which emphasises the board's monitoring role. Second, unlike traditional governance models, the role of board process is explicitly advocated here. Third, the three conceptual models regarding the relationship among board structure, process and performance give an alternative avenue for researchers to explain inconsistencies in past board research. They complement the growing interest in opening up the "black-box" of decision making that has been manifested in studies involving top management teams. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

This paper examines the ethics of contemporary managerial compensation in the context of executive stock options. Economic considerations would dictate that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate the effect of overall stock market movements which are beyond the control of the executive. However, in practice, most executive stock options are not adjusted to control for these outside factors. Agency considerations are the most likely culprit. Adjusting for the influence of outside factors, such as a generally rising stock market, from executive stock options sets a higher bar for managers to reach. Furthermore, traditional accounting standards permitted firms that did not adjust options to avoid reporting options as expenses. This presents CEOs and boards of directors with a major ethical dilemma. On the one hand, their duty to their shareholders and stakeholders dictates that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate outside noise from unrelated movements in the overall stock market. However, financial statements are presented in the language of accounting. If the overwhelming majority of the users of a language define a particular item in one way, then to deviate from the norm implies that the recipient of such a deviant statement may not properly interpret the statement. Likewise, if the standard practice is for firms to use unadjusted options and thus under-report expenses, to deviate from this industry norm risks that users of financial statements would not properly interpret the financial statements, with perhaps negative consequences for the shareholders. In short, if "everyone else does it," then it could be wrong for an individual firm to deviate from the norm as that would harm the shareholders. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Research about boards and governance has been characterized by the dominance of few concepts and a limited number of methods. This article introduces methods and concepts that help us explore board processes. Six illustrative studies of board processes are presented, including the use of 'one of the lads' - methods, 'flies on the wall' - methods, interpretation of 'board life stories' of women directors, reconstructive case studies and the use of questionnaire surveys directed to multiple respondents in each case. The article shows directions for how to open the 'black box' of board processes.

During recent decades boards have mostly been studied within a framework of corporate governance where the interests of external investors are emphasized. We will here break some new ground, offering a major survey on boards of directors throughout various European countries, and opening up the hitherto unexamined area of study of board behaviour and the workings of the value creating board. A framework is presented including concepts such as: the knowledge and diversity of board members; trust and interactions inside and outside the boardroom; board leadership and structure; boardroom decision-making; and corporate entrepreneurship and innovation. The value creation of boards is not only related to value protection for certain shareholders or value distribution to various stakeholders, but also to value creation throughout the whole value chain - as in relation to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship, for example.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

In this study, we examine firm and board characteristics that predict whether a new CEO will come from the firm's current management, from the board of directors, or from outside the firm. This study is the first to recognize the potential for outside board members to compete for the CEO position. Though classified as firm outsiders, outside directors have many of the advantages of insider candidates for CEO: firm-specific knowledge and familiarity with the board of directors. This form of succession is likely to be valuable in high-technology industries, as competition is faster paced and information asymmetry is greater than in lower technology industries. In this study, we focus on a single high-tech industry (semiconductors) in the period between 1993 and 2000. We find that the presence of an heir-apparent increases the likelihood of insider succession while outsider board members' availability increases the likelihood that an outside director will become the new CEO. We also find that firms with high levels of R&D spending and rapid sales growth favor insiders as new CEOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the CEO's relationship with the board.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

Purpose - This paper characterizes the role of the board of directors in a more specific way than has been done previously, and uses this characterization to support the argument that, in some cases, the mandate of an effective board should go beyond the prevention of self-interested behavior by management. The enlarged role for the board of directors that this paper contemplates carries with it the need to ensure shareholders that the board of directors is not engaging in self-interested behavior of its own, and posits that requiring the board of directors to report to shareholders on its activities and effectiveness is a potential solution to this problem. The paper seeks to present theoretically grounded ideas on how this might be done in a meaningful fashion. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a "short list" of reporting items for boards of directors, derived from a theoretical model that examines board of director performance from a group dynamics perspective. Findings - This paper proposes measure for board of director performance reporting that are based upon potential active agency roles. The authors suggest that future dialogue regarding board of director performance reporting might be well served by recognizing the limitations of previous research that has found differing and questionable links between board characteristics and organizational outcomes. Research limitations/implications - The authors suggest that the items derived from the theoretical model for examining board of director performance reporting need to be empirically assessed in terms of their usefulness in a variety of industries and contexts. Practical implications - The authors argue that active agency roles and functional group dynamics should form the backbone of a board of director performance reporting process. Originality/value - This paper extends the board of director performance reporting literature by providing a theoretically grounded rationale for measuring and conceptualizing board effectiveness.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of the characteristics related to the ownership structure and board of directors, as mechanisms of governance, on the research and development (R&D) intensity. The study carried out on a sample of French companies belonging to the SBF 250 index shows that ownership concentration and duality of chief executive officer and chairman roles have no significant effect on the R & D intensity. The board sizes as well as the proportion of inside directors in the board have a positive and significant effect on R & D intensity. However, the participation of outside directors in capital tends to urge managers to reduce R&D investment level.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

This study analyses the influence of various characteristics of the Board of Directors on the control and risk of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It also examines the effect on these variables of some of the CEO personal characteristics and of various contingencies of the firm. The results reveal that control of the CEO compensation is determined fundamentally by the CEO participation in the capital of the firm, while the level of risk of the CEO compensation package is higher when the firm is diversified and implements a proactive competitive strategy.

In this paper the conceptual frameworks, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm risk-taking behaviour, are examined. From a sample of 243 Australian listed firms, it is found that leadership structure does not have any significant influence on firm risk; higher blockholder ownership or lower dividend payout is related to increased performance variance. This research suffers from some limitations; the archival study of the functional background of board chairman may not reveal the underlying relationship between the board of directors and firm risk-taking behaviour. We only test the influence of leadership structure on performance variance; further research could investigate the potential impact of board composition on firm risk-taking propensity.

In this paper several theories, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm performance, are tested. The results indicate that, for Australian listed companies, there is no strong relationship between leadership structure and subsequent performance. It is reported that companies with higher blockholder ownership or lower managerial shareholdings tend to have an affiliated chairman; firm with higher managerial shareholdings tend to have an executive chairman. The evidence suggests that there is no one optimal leadership structure; each structure, which could be an outcome of a rational choice process influenced by other governance characteristics of individual firms, may have associated costs and benefits.

The IPO process may potentially introduce or increase agency costs. The newly public firm must deal with these agency problems. We find that following an IPO, the CEO compensation structure on average becomes more pay and performance-sensitive, and the board of directors becomes more independent. Venture capitalist participation seems to positively influence these findings. However, these post-IPO changes do not lead to better short-run operating performance.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

This study examines whether the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board of directors is associated with firms' timeliness in the remediation of material weaknesses (MWs) in internal control. The sample comprises accelerated filers that disclosed at least one MW from July 2003 to December 2004 under section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Using logistic regression analyses, I find that firms with larger audit committees, audit committees with greater nonaccounting financial expertise, and more independent boards are more likely to remediate MWs in a timely manner. These results suggest that the audit committee and the board play an important role in monitoring the remediation of MWs. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board under the SOX regime. The study also identifies important determinants of firms' timeliness in the remediation of MWs, which is key to improving financial reporting quality and restoring investor confidence. (c) CAAA.

It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Debates about the ethics of executive compensation are dominated by familiar themes. Many writers consider whether the amount of pay CEOs receive is too large-relative to firm performance, foreign CEO pay, or employee pay. Many others consider whether the process by which CEOs are paid is compromised by weak or self-serving boards of directors. This paper examines the issue from a new perspective. I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms. Accepting excessive compensation leaves the beneficiaries of their duties (e.g., shareholders) worse off, and thus is inconsistent with observing those duties. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Purpose - This paper aims to review how corporate governance is institutionalised in Nigeria and examine the relationship between board size, CEOs' duality, board composition and the board's involvement in strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was sent by post to the chairmen of 138 publicly quoted companies in Nigeria in November 2004. Findings - Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the Nigerian public companies have embraced some principles of the Code of Best Practices for Public Companies. There is a high level of board involvement in strategy decision-making process, but no correlation was found between board involvement and a number of governance variables (board size, board independence and CEO duality). Research limitations/implications - The sample of 39 responding companies is small although it represents a 28 per cent of response rate and is representative of the Nigerian stock market. However, we are unable to look at other factors such as industry sectors and we cannot generalise our findings regarding corporate governance practices in Nigeria. Practical implications - The investment climate in Nigeria can become more reassuring than in the past although there is room for further improvements as the effectiveness of the corporate government practices is still in doubt. Originality/value - This paper adds to the scanty literature available on corporate governance practices in developing, countries. Findings extend our understanding about the strategic functions of the board in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, and the world's sixth larger producer of oil.

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

This research study focuses on the problems involved in nominating board members based solely on rules and regulations, which neglect the affective dynamics of board behaviour and board process. For example, choosing board candidates who are independent (not part of a company's management), a rule imposed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) guidelines, may ensure that an organisation remains listed on this lucrative exchange. However, it does not ensure that the candidates have the necessary knowledge or are well versed in the company's business activities to effectively serve on a particular board. Having independent board members does not ensure that they ask tough questions of themselves or of management or that they have an extensive network from which to draw for advice on strategic issues. These are equally important areas of board governance that cannot be ignored when choosing candidates for the board, and these questions should not be suppressed in favour of concentrating solely on formal concerns such as independence. Information about board characteristics can provide management theorists with a broader range of informal variables that can contribute to the decision-making process. Board characteristics assist the board in operating as a team, improving the efficiency of the board. Selecting board members with the most suitable and effective characteristics for a particular board ensures that directors are spending their limited time on the company's most important challenges. This research was carried out in several stages in order to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In this research there was a significant relationship for values and decision-making and no relationship for TSXFormal and decision-making, which is consistent with the literature, suggesting there must be a change in executives values to ensure changes in behaviour. A corporate governance model was developed. This model helps in ensuring that boards populated with board members who have knowledge and values (skills matrices) are more aware of the detrimental effect that groupthink can have on the decision-making process. Several executives mentioned the ability of board members to apply due diligence to strategic decision-making. This means that directors apply their experience and expertise to better understand issues and bring these to bear upon the decision-making process. Additionally, knowledge, values and groupthink (skill matrices) may be used both when nominating new board members and as an annual evaluative tool. Businesses are continually diversifying and board members need to continuously embellish their skill set and knowledge in order to adapt. However, the finding and the development of this corporate governance model are significant as they mark the start of how board characteristics can be operationalised. What is needed is more balanced research that looks at both the formal and the informal system. In doing so, more articulate measures of board decision-making process will evolve. The business environment is ever changing and dynamic; research in these areas will convey the interrelationship between the formal and informal system. Nevertheless, this research is unique as it has investigated the formal and informal system using both primary qualitative and quantitative data analysis and therefore provides much needed information about the characteristics requisite for nominating board members.

Combining human capital theory and equity theory, we developed and tested a model in which the outside directors' total cash compensation is related to the outsider's profile, as well as to the board and firm characteristics. Consistent with our model, characteristics of the outsider's profile, in terms of his/her role and responsibility, meeting activities and length of service, are relevant. Only the director's popularity, as a part of his/her human capital, has a significant effect on his/her compensation. Our empirical results confirm the necessity to create a stronger link between the remuneration policies of the outsider directors and their contribution in a board, in terms of human capital. The remuneration policies adopted by firms should be linked to practices on corporate governance useful for helping outsiders contribute confidently to their work of the board and receive ongoing support and information so they can develop their understanding of the total environment within they work. Then, we suggest having recourse to qualifications and professional skills as well as to specific training or board induction programmes defined by firms themselves. Finally, the Combined Code should promote the adoption and spreading of such practices on market. (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the argument that formal regulations alone may not be the defining factor in improving corporate governance and the decision making process of the BOD. Design/methodology/approach: Based on 20 semi-structured interviews with board chairs, members of corporate boards, CEOs, and upper/executive management at 12 Canadian companies, a bird's eye view is taken from the top. A content analysis of the interviews was performed. a clear picture about the interaction and behaviour of directors emerged. Subsequently, three objectives that are required for effective decision-making were developed: knowledge; motivation; and transmission channels/internal control. The analysis offers three critical objectives, which all boards should endeavour to accomplish. Findings: These interviews demystify board process and provide the bases for three critical objectives for effective corporate governance: ascertain and embellish the knowledge base of directors; motivate directors to share and gather information; and ensure clear and fluent transmission channels exist. Practical implications: The usual board measures such as CEO duality, insider and outsider ratio, number of board members and directors' share ownership may not be the only critical determinants of board effectiveness. Originality/value: Conventional notions of decision making have neglected key human faculties and individual characteristics that combine to determine organizational outcomes. This paper fulfils a need for research in the area of board processes and board decision making and provides a roadmap to improve corporate governance within organizations.

Golden parachutes are often viewed as a form of excessive compensation because they provide senior management with substantial payouts following an acquisition while other stakeholders are subjected to layoffs, disrupted business relationships and other negative externalities. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms, an economic and ethical justification for this type of contract is given. Golden parachutes ensure effective corporate governance that, in turn, preserve the firm's value for all stakeholders. Boards of directors enter into parachute agreements to protect recently hired CEOs' human capital during periods of financial uncertainty and, thus, potential takeover activity. From an ethics viewpoint, golden parachutes are valuable to all stakeholders because they encourage merger or acquisition in lieu of bankruptcy. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA; evaluate the corporate governance alternatives to "sayonpay" legislation; recommend a policy encouraging enhanced executive accountability; and suggest research questions pertaining to "sayonpay" proposals and executive compensation for scholars to pursue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes an exploratory approach to discussing and analyzing the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA and offering an alternative corporate governance approach to enhancing executive performance. Findings - The paper finds that whether an annual nonbinding "sayonpay" policy is instituted or not within a company is not the crux of the executive compensation issue. What is important is whether concerned shareholders have the ability to have proxy access and successfully pass such a resolution, thereby exercising shareholder pressure on the board of directors to implement a corporate policy of equating appropriate executive compensation with managerial performance. Moreover, this improvement in boardshareowner engagement, along with expanded disclosure of executive compensation packages, will assist in obviating the need for the exercise of a draconian shareholder resolution to remove directors. Originality/value - This paper offers an indepth review of the "sayonpay" legislative and corporate governance controversy; places the issue in the context of effective corporate governance; recommends a reasoned approach to executive compensation accountability; and offers a list of research questions for corporate governance and human resource management scholars to pursue.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Our study investigates an unexplored succession process-interim CEO successions. We define an interim CEO succession as a case where the title of chief executive officer is vacated by the incumbent and the board of directors has not announced a permanent successor, but instead designates a particular individual as 'interim CEO,' or 'acting CEO,' or 'CEO until a permanent successor is named.' Theory predicts that interim CEO successions will lead to the type of disruption that can harm firm performance, even after a permanent successor is appointed. Our data show that interim CEO succession processes are widely employed by publicly-traded U.S. firms, and that they are associated with lower performance during the period in which the interim serves. However, whether the interim CEO also simultaneously serves as chairman moderates the impact of this type of succession on firm performance, as well as on long-term firm survival.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the influence of corporate board structure on corporate value. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected on a sample of 245 Thai non-financial listed companies to examine the effect of board structure on firm performance. Findings: The results show that neither independent directors nor grey directors are the significant determinants of improving firm value. Research limitations/implications: This research was confined to 245 Thai non-financial listed companies. It would be useful to replicate it using larger samples under different country settings. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance to top managers in deciding the Board structure as corporate value is also grounded in corporate board structure. Originality/value: The paper provides far reaching implications for corporate managers about the relationship between Board characteristics and corporate value. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Why did the majority of directors prior to the financial crisis not have the foresight to predict the problems of taking on too much risk? We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Compared to the debate on corporate governance in the private sector and to the literature on the macro level of governance in the public sector, the micro-level governance of public organisations remains a neglected area of discussion. Against this backdrop, the paper presents an overview of international literature regarding boards in the public sector organisations, in order to evidence if, and in which terms, the board of directors has been a topic of research in public governance in the recent years. In conclusion, the paper provides suggestions for future research on boards in public organisations. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of corporate governance by analyzing the impact of board structure on firm technical efficiency. Resampling methods and bootstrapping techniques applied in Data Envelopment Analysis are used to evaluate firm performance. Truncated regressions are estimated to determine the effect of five board characteristics-board size, board independence, board reputation, board diversity and board activity-on efficiency. The result of this empirical study shows that business technical efficiency increases with a heterogeneous board with a limited number of directorships per director and with a limited activity specified in a reduced number of annual board meetings with a higher number of specialized committees.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Literature on acquisition places more concern on the consequence of an acquisition event and pays less attention to what factors influence the motive for initiating the acquisition strategy of a firm. Through the lenses of organizational learning and corporate governance theories, the study examine whether the prior acquisition experience and board characteristics affect firms' acquisition behavior. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 92 acquisition events of Taiwanese electronics firms during the period from 1997 to 2007 by employing the survival function model. Empirical results indicate that business acquisition experience positively influence the inclination of the acquirer adopting a subsequent acquisition, while board characteristics do not relate to the likelihood of the acquirer making a subsequent acquisition. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for organizational learning and corporate governance theories in general and acquisition management in particular.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The number of foreigners appointed to top management teams has increased significantly over the past decade. However, the question of why some firms elect to employ foreign nationals in top executive positions remains unclear. This study tests competing explanations based on strategic fit, human capital and attraction-selection-attrition perspectives. Results from empirical tests utilizing a multi-level methodology on a sample of Swiss publicly listed companies suggest that degree of international diversification is positively associated with the likelihood of having a foreign executive, whereas human capital characteristics do not explain the propensity to employ a foreigner on the top management team. In addition, nationality diversity at the board level, as well as the international experience of the top management team, predict the probability of having a foreign top executive.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the power dynamics of the boards of directors in family-owned and listed Turkish companies. Power and dominance in the boardroom can be studied in relation to three variables: the institutional environment in which the firm is embedded; the structural configurations of the board; and the top manager's propensity to exercise his/her power resources. Focusing on the board level, this paper aims to conceptualize power dynamics as being composed of structural attributes, roles assumed, responsibilities, dependency and representation. Design/methodology/approach: The research domain of this exploratory study is family-owned and listed companies operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The data for the study were collected from three different sources: a survey administered to members of the boards of directors; discourse analysis of corporate governance compliance reports of the same companies; and in-depth interviews conducted with board members. Findings: This study shows that on a typical board of directors of a family-owned and listed Turkish company, the interests of owners and managers are aligned and other stakeholders are not represented; the role of the board is confined to visibility and legitimacy and does not include control. Originality/value: This paper argues that theories developed for Anglo-Saxon equity-market based business systems have limited exploratory power for an emerging economy - namely Turkey - that is based on a business system characterized by close co-operation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets.

Purpose - The paper aims to study the effect of tenure on the structure of CEO compensation. The relation between CEO compensation and CEO tenure provides a good testing bed for many effects: the managerial power effect, the portfolio consideration effect, the learning effect, and the career concern effect. Design/methodology/approach - Tobit regressions were run of the percentage of equity-based compensation on CEO tenure and the effect of tenure compared between inside CEOs and outside CEOs. Findings - It was found that the percentage of equity-based compensation increases during the early years of tenure for outside CEOs, and decreases during the later years of tenure for inside CEOs. Before they are tenured, outside CEOs have significantly higher and faster growing percentage of equity-based compensation than inside CEOs. Furthermore, the portfolio consideration effect and the learning effect are the major effects in explaining the effect of tenure on the compensation structure. Practical implications - The evidence that boards of directors take into account the CEOs' holdings of equity incentives, the types of CEOs, and their years on tenure to adjust the structure of CEO compensation indicates that firms should, and do, try to optimize their CEO compensation structure on the basis of firm-specific or CEO-specific characteristics. It is suggested that there is no simple formulaic approach to governance reform. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature by studying and explaining the different patterns of compensation structure over CEO tenure between inside CEOs and outside CEOs.

This paper analyses how the composition and ownership structure of boards of directors affect firms' R&D investments. Most research on the impact of the board focuses on corporate performance in an Anglo-American context. This study explores the influence of the board on R&D investments in the Spanish corporate governance system, which is different from the British and US systems. Data from 86 Spanish quoted companies in technology industries show that board composition influences R&D investments. Further, our results indicate that ownership structure can moderate the relation between board composition and R&D investments. This study states opposing hypotheses, based on arguments from agency and stewardship theories. We use these theories to analyse the influence of the board on R&D investments as a key factor for success in highly competitive technology industries. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

Recent research into the role of boards of directors has adopted a cognitive point of view rather than a traditional governance perspective rooted in agency theory (Charreaux and Wirtz, 2006). The present study examines the structural embeddedness of boards and the influence of networks of boards of directors on the adoption of corporate governance practices. More specifically, it focuses on two aspects of social capital, namely the cohesion between actors within dense and closed networks (Coleman, 1988), and openness within networks containing numerous structural holes (Burt, 1992). The main results of this study emphasize the crucial role of board's network openness in the adoption of corporate governance practices and the importance of the diversity of cognitive resources acquired by boards of directors within their social networks.

This article presents both theoretical and empirical support for a movement from a traditional governance research paradigm towards a more holistic research approach. This includes taking into account behavioural, contingency and evolutionary theories, in an effort to better understand governance processes and effective board behaviour. Specifically, the authors highlight the importance of three groups of relationships (board dynamics, board-management relationships and board-stakeholder relationships) as contributing to good governance practice. Whilst historically researchers have largely ignored the behavioural aspects of corporate governance, the authors have made an attempt to open the 'black box' of governance processes and practices, and illustrate with examples from three New Zealand companies how the development of these relationships are important for effective board functioning.

This study explores the influence Boards of Directors' demographic characteristics on the process of making strategic decisions. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 105 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The results suggest that educational level affect both the financial reporting and the hierarchical decentralisation in the strategic decision-making process. Also, functional background of executives was found to be related with financial reporting. However, the educational specialty did not appear to have any significant influence on the strategic decision-making process. In light of these findings, implications for practitioners are made and avenues for future research are suggested.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

This paper uses a sample of 76 family businesses in Tunisia to investigate the impact of the family firm dynamic on the composition of their boards of directors. We argue that whether or not a transition in ownership is planned, firms have different governance needs and characteristics depending on the generational phase. The empirical results show that board composition is positively influenced by both generational evolution and succession planning. This study provides evidence of an increase in the appointment of outside directors to boards of family firms from the third generation of ownership. This result implies that it is important to consider the generational phase and succession process of the family firm in order to better understand its governance system.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance structure and performance of Indian companies. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of selected board characteristics and ownership structure on the firm performance. This analysis ranges over a period of six years, from 2001-02 to 2006-07 and is based on Pharmaceutical and IT industry. Least square dummy variable regression model has been used to study the relationship. We find that while board size, listing status of firm and foreign shareholding has positive and significant relationship with firm performance, public shareholding has negative and significant impact. However, independent director proportion, participation rate of independent directors and separation of Chairman and CEO post does not have a significant relationship with firm performance.

Board of directors deal with complex, strategic issues and conflict among members is natural. Group conflict is often associated with reduced productivity and lower cohesiveness. However, conflict might also improve group decision making and governance practices. This paper seeks to examine the relationship among the following: (a) three types of conflict (cognitive, affective and process) and board performance; (b) board performance and firm performance; and (c) the mediating role of board performance on board conflict and firm performance. It was found that only cognitive conflict is (positively) related to board performance. In addition, board performance does not impact firm performance nor board performance mediates the relationship between board conflict and firm performance. (c) 2010, SAGE Publications Ltd.

We present a set of factors which can contribute to the effectiveness of boards of directors in managing strategy implementation. Following more recent research strands on corporate governance and boards, we focus on non-structural factors related to cognitive, behavioral, work process and power dimensions. They may enhance the explanatory power of structural features of boards where the latter's effectiveness is concerned. The identified factors are cohesiveness, presence of knowledge and skills, use of knowledge and skills, effort norms, cognitive conflict, task performance and information architecture. They were divided into sets of observable variables, which were consolidated into an instrument - reference lists - with a view to helping scholars and practitioners in assessing how boards rank in these factors.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

We develop and test a novel theory about strategic noise with regard to CEO appointments. Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to evidence the disclosure practices of Spanish companies in relation to a voluntary typology of strategic information; and to determine the factors that explain these practices. Among the factors considered, the study seeks to focus on the role of the Board of Directors in depth. According to Agency Theory, strategic information has positive consequences on external funds costs. On the other hand, Proprietary Costs theory limits these practices, given that they can lead to competitive disadvantages. Design/methodology/approach: First, online strategic information disclosure practices are analysed by examining non-financial quoted Spanish firms. A disclosure index is created, and subsequently, certain factors related to corporate governance - Activity, Size and Board Independence - as well as other factors traditionally analysed, are used to explain the volume of strategic information disclosed on the internet. Findings: The results indicate that Spanish companies, on average, give out little strategic information, mainly related to objectives, their mission, and the company's philosophy. "Company annual planning" and "Information on risks" are scarcely disclosed. The findings also emphasise that companies where the Chairperson of the Board is the same person as the CEO and, moreover, in which there is a lower frequency of meetings, disclose a greater amount of strategic information on their web sites. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the disclosure of strategic information is a decision taken by executives with the aim of satisfying the demands of creditors and investors. The Board of Directors represents the shareholders' interests, but it does not participate in strategic decision-making disclosure, maybe due to the fact that the proprietary costs lack influence. Originality/value: The link between corporate governance and strategic information disclosed online has scarcely been analysed in previous literature. This study provides interesting insights into how several Board characteristics can affect the disclosure of strategic information on the internet. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

This study explores the competing influences of different types of board interlocks on diffusion of a strategic initiative among a population of firms. We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption. We discuss the implications of our study for social network analysis, governance, and internationalization research. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

This paper develops an analytical framework to depict the heterogeneity that characterises the role of board chair and demonstrate the potential variability in how chairs operate boards and exercise power and influence on strategy, control and resource related tasks at board level. Theories of power and influence, as applied to top management teams and boards of directors, are explicated within the context of contemporary governance practices that are establishing the role of the board chair as distinct to that of the chief executive officer. Specifically, the paper maps sources of power and varying contemporary chair practices, including chair nomenclature (i. e. executive vs. non-executive chairs), chair origin (insider vs. outsider) and chair time (full-time vs. part-time). A number of theoretical chair-power models emerge from this analysis and are subject to empirical analysis using data collected from 160 chairs of 500 FTSE-listed companies. Theoretically and empirically, the paper complements structural approaches to studying boards with attention to behaviour on boards. By linking board structure, board process and the exercise of influence, the study reveals both differences amongst chairs in how they run the board, but also that chairs' differ in the influence they exert on board-related tasks. Full-time executive chairs exert their greatest influence in strategy and resource dependence tasks whereas part-time, non-executive chairs seem to exert more influence over monitoring and control tasks.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to attempt to verify the predicted relationship between the demographic (i.e. tenure, functional background, etc.) difference and cognitive difference among top managers and examine how such a relationship is affected by the communication among top managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal manager on a TMT, and that such a relationship is mediated by the degree of communication that the focal manager has with other team members on the TMT. Using Structural Equation Modeling techniques, these hypotheses were tested based on a sample of 348 top managers that consist of 28 top management teams. Findings: It was found that the hypothesized relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal top manager was supported with respect to the tenure of a manager, but not the functional background of a manager. Moreover, it was found that communication frequency of a focal manager with other team members mediated the relationship between the tenure deviation and the cognitive deviation of the focal manager and that tenure deviation negatively influenced communication frequency, which in turn, negatively influenced the cognitive deviation of the manager. Practical implications: These findings imply that: when constructing a competitive top management, practitioners such as boards of directors of a firm should pay more attention to the tenure diversity of a top management team because tenure diversity influences the cognitive diversity of the team; and communication among members of a management team can reduce the cognitive differences among members. However, communication happens more frequently among managers with similar tenure than among managers with dissimilar tenure. To promote consensus, managers need to watch for the forming of group fault lines along tenure within their teams. Originality/value: As far as is known, this is the first study that uses relational demography to examine the influence of tenure difference on cognitive difference among members of a top management team and to expose a mediating role played by communication frequency.

Identifying, attracting, and maintaining the engagement of the right composition of people for a non-profit Board is a major challenge. Executives should ensure that their Boards accurately represent the stakeholders that matter, both from industry and the community. The purpose of this paper is to describe ways and offer propositions for effective non-profit executives to identify, recruit, and motivate the continuing engagement of the members needed on their Boards in order to acquire resources critical to their sustained success. The Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) are used as an example, since at least 93 percent of CVBs have a governance structure that includes a Board of Directors. Successfully attracting the right mix of stakeholders is a result of an extensive recruitment effort by the CVB executive. Prior research reports that successful executives take great care in making selection decisions that reflect the interests of the community in the Board's composition. Based on the literature on Boards and governance, the authors develop propositions regarding the composition of CVB Boards. While the research is exploratory, it is found that CVBs with more diverse Boards are more successful than those with less diverse Boards. It is argued that effective CVBs use a thoughtful process for heterogeneous Board selection. It is also suggested that Board performance should be evaluated on an annual basis to recognize the need for active involvement in the Board selection process. The successful selection of Board members is important because of the implications for Board effectiveness. While there is a large body of literature offering advice on Board selection, there is little on recruitment. Moreover, there is little discussion of Board composition strategy based on balancing access to critical resources of stakeholders. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

In the recent years the Russian Government has undertaken serious steps to improve corporate governance practices by introducing the Corporate Code of Governance (CCG) and strengthening the role of corporate boards to monitor top management performance. This paper investigates whether these measures have stimulated positive changes by increasing the demand for higher quality audit. We test our hypotheses using 147 non-listed companies to examine whether board composition influences audit fee in the Russian capital market. Our findings support the demand-side perspective of audit services and suggest that audit fees are associated positively with the presence of an independent chairman, higher proportion of independent directors and State representatives on the board.

The study seeks to understand how the firm's ownership structure and the board of directors' composition influence the structural capital. The latter is apprehended by three main levers: TMT compensation, innovation, and firm's reputation. By mobilizing several panel linear regressions on 274 American firms, the results show that the firms which heavily invest in structural capital are more successful and chaired by the younger and heterogeneous TMT. No disciplinary effect of the board on structural capital has been found. The results support the cognitive theory assumptions. The classic perspective failed to explain the structural capital phenomena. In order to enhance their structural capital, firms must pay a close attention to their board cognitive contribution and not to its disciplinary role.

This paper examines the effects of director ownership and the proportion of outside directors on firms' commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using a sample of 453 Hong Kong listed companies for 2005, we find that there is a non-linear relationship between the level of director ownership and firms' engagement in CSR behavior. Commitment to CSR first increases as the proportion of director ownership increases up to 50% and then decreases as that proportion of ownership grows higher. Further, the proportion of outside directors on the board exhibits a positive relationship with the level of CSR commitment. These results provide explanations for firms' commitment to CSR from the corporate governance perspective.

The failure of the CEO has been studied at great length in the literature. We order and classify the factors that lead to CEO failure into those a CEO can influence (endogenous) and those that are given (exogenous). The absence of unanimity in the literature leads us to conclude that insufficient attention has been paid to the main factor: the personal characteristics of CEOs. The agency approach and method are insufficient to understand leadership performance in organizations, due to the oversimplified view of human nature on which they are based and their heavy reliance on mathematical modeling.

The recent financial crisis highlighted the issue of Board of Directors compensation, which had been analyzed by many authors. In fact, there is a vast academic literature on the impact of the compensation of Board of Directors on corporations characterized by the separation of ownership from control. The compensation of Board of Directors has been a subject of debate, also by global regulators like OECD, FSB, Central Bank of Italy and European Commission and many are pushing for an international uniform regulation. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the board of Directors compensation, the company performance and the risks decided by the Board. The article analyses a sample of Italian listed companies in order to test wether or not the Board of Directors compensation structure could turn into a performance incentive, given the risk taken.

This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

There is a growing consensus that boards of directors "matter," but the specific effects of board influences on organizational innovation remain unclear. Although boards of directors have been studied extensively in diverse disciplines-finance, management, sociology, nonprofit management, and economics-those studies have focused primarily on how board variables influence organizational effectiveness and performance. Missing from these studies is explanation of the relationships between the board of directors and organizational innovation (Wu, 2008a). This article links previous research and theories on governance and organizational innovation, examines how the board of directors may influence organizational innovation, and presents an integrative model that includes direct and indirect linkages between the board demographic and process variables, board effectiveness, and organizational innovation.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effects of corporate governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, and executive bonus pay in Japanese firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of the largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth and bonus pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability and bonus pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability and bonus pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth and bonus pay relationship. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study makes a contribution to research on ownership heterogeneity and executive compensation by empirically showing that different owners and directors affiliated with certain ownership groups have varied implications on the firm performance-executive pay relationship. It also makes a contribution to research on corporate governance change by providing insights on how different actors facilitate shifts in the linkage between performance and pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

Using a sample of U.S. lodging firms, this paper examines the relationship between board of director characteristics and chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Previous research shows that larger boards are detrimental to the effectiveness of the board of directors and deteriorate the control imposed on CEO actions and pay. Board independence is also suggested as an important quality to emphasize the control on the CEO. We propose that U.S. lodging firms' board of directors provide a nice setting to investigate the effects of size and independence on CEO compensation level. Our findings suggest that CEO compensation is not related to board size, and positively related to proportion of the outside board members. These findings are contrary to the findings of previous studies. Our findings may provide significant insights to lodging firms' board of directors to structure efficient compensation packages.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

Business educators have a responsibility to ensure that future managers, employees, and shareholders are well versed in governance. Governance provides a vital link between organizations and society, allowing people to place their trust in an organization, support its mission, and ensure a continuing flow of resources to accomplish the mission. This article discusses coursework in board governance that combines a 5-month internship on a community nonprofit board with academic class work on governance topics to create a unique learning opportunity. The course combines elements of internship, mentorship, and service learning with more traditional academic activities such as lectures, guest speakers, research, and analysis. Students gain greater awareness of the needs of the broader community and the challenges of serving them. The community gains from a growing pool of people with governance knowledge and skills who understand the value of community service. (c) OBTS Teaching Society for Management Educators 2012.

This paper examines the relationship between the characteristics of boards of directors and the financial distress of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The sample consists of 68 companies whose listing status on Bursa Malaysia was being suspended between 2005 and 2009, under the provision of Practice Note 17 (PN17) of the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirements. The study develops a multinomial logit regression model to test three categories of PN17 listing statuses: re-listed on Bursa Malaysia, remain as PN17, and de-listed from Bursa Malaysia. The model relates the listing status to five characteristics of the boards of directors as independent variables, specifically leadership structure, equity ownership, board involvement, financial literacy and multiple directorships of board members; and four control variables, namely firm size, leverage, return on assets and audit quality. The study expects that the success of PN17 listing outcomes depends on the ability of the board of directors to establish and implement the restructuring plan. The results show that the relisting of PN17 companies is negatively related to financial literacy and equity ownership of the board of directors and positively related to the involvement of the board. The results imply that boards of directors with a lower ownership and financial literacy, but more actively involved, are more capable of overcoming financial difficulties.

This paper examines whether efficiency monitoring has a positive influence on corporate performance by using the fixed effect model with panel data of listed firms in Taiwan from 2005 to 2010. The results show that having a shared interest group, formed by the controlling shareholders of a company and its board directors, leads to a failing monitoring function of the board of directors. Moreover, greater divergence between the number of board seats controlled and voting rights leads to a higher likelihood of corporate performance appearing to be an inverted curve. If this divergence exceeds a certain threshold, the interests of external shareholders may be harmed by large shareholders.Copyright (c) 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

This research deals with the review of researches on strategic decision making and the factors that has contributed to its growth and how it has affected the organisational performance. This study is focused on five major themes; decision making environment; comprehensiveness and speed/timing; Top Management Team (TMT), Chief Executive Officers (CEO's) and Board of Directors (BOD's); communication, information system and decentralised strategy and culture, hierarchical decentralisation and power distance, lateral communication and individualism, formahsation and uncertainty avoidance. It has been established that all these factors will lead to high organisational performance even in a turbulent business environment. The methodological approach of the reviewed researches is based on survey method with the use of questionnaire that makes the studies to be empirical in nature. (c) Medwell journals, 2012.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the effects of firm- and country-level "good" corporate governance prescriptions on firm performance before and during the recent financial crisis, using a large sample of 1,197 firms across 26 European countries. Research Findings/Insights: We propose a contextualized agency perspective suggesting that firm- and country-level good governance prescriptions designed to assure managerial oversight may not hold in a financial crisis. This is because firms can benefit from broadening managerial discretion so as to facilitate the exercise of initiative and decisive leadership. Overall, our firm- and country-level findings support this argument. In a crisis, CEO duality is associated with better performance. We also find that the use of incentive compensation and the existence of a wedge between ownership and control rights negatively impacts on firm performance in a crisis. Hierarchical linear modeling shows that 25 percent of the heterogeneity in firm performance is among countries, indicating the importance of including country-level institutions in our analyses. In a crisis, we find that the general quality of the legal system and creditor rights protection are positively related to firm performance, but protection for equity investors is not. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The findings challenge the universality of good governance prescriptions and contribute to the growing body of work proposing that the efficacy of governance mechanisms may be contingent upon organizational and environmental circumstances. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study offers insights relevant to policy and practitioner communities, showing that governance mechanisms operate differently in crisis and non-crisis periods. The tendency to respond to a crisis with more stringent rules may be counterproductive since such measures may compromise executives' ability to respond appropriately to systemic shocks. Practitioners are encouraged to optimize rather than maximize their governance choices. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

This study asserts that the effects of board characteristics on firm innovation need to be evaluated with reference to contingency variables. A literature review suggests that relatively few studies adopt a contingency view when examining the outcomes of boards of directors. This study examines the influence on firm innovation of characteristics such as board size, outsider ratio and board diversity, and suggests that their influence is contingent upon firm size. The model is tested on a sample of Italian companies and finds support for the contingency hypothesis. This study advances research on boards of directors by emphasizing the importance of context.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

When academic researchers, business commentators, and boards of directors have debated the merits of hiring new CEOs from outside the firm, the implicit or explicit assumption typically made is that outsider CEOs will provide an advantage in achieving strategic change. In this study, we challenge this assumption by employing a duality perspective on stability/change, and we provide an original conceptual framework to posit that it is the presence of corporate stability (ordinary succession, a long-tenured predecessor CEO, and good firm performance) that allows outsider CEOs to generate a greater degree of post-succession strategic change. We use extensive longitudinal data from US airline and chemical industries between 1972 and 2010 to test our hypotheses, and we discuss how our supportive findings challenge long-standing assumptions regarding the outsider succession-strategic change relationship, and we advocate embracing the non-intiutive notion that stable (unstable) conditions can be enablers (barriers) of strategic change for outsider CEOs.

Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to examine the influence of the educational qualifications of board members, including the CEO, on the financial performance of Indonesian listed firms. Indonesia is a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a sample comprising 160 firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) are used as measures of financial performance. It uses four proxies for board members' educational qualifications, namely postgraduate degrees, degrees obtained from prestigious universities, degrees obtained from developed countries, and degrees in financial disciplines. Regressions are performed separately for the supervisory board, management board, and CEO. Findings - This study provides empirical evidence that the educational qualifications of board members and the CEO matter, to a particular extent, in explaining either ROA or Tobin's Q. For example, CEOs holding degrees from prestigious domestic universities perform significantly better than those without such qualifications. Practical implications - Even though intellectual competence should appear to be one of the considerations in the appointment of board members, educational qualification is not always a good proxy for superior advising or managerial quality. There may be many other factors that need to be considered, such as experiences, managerial skills, networks, and other skills obtained outside schools. As such, the establishment of a nomination committee, which is expected to provide independent recommendations on qualified candidates to serve in the boardrooms, plays an important role. Originality/value - Empirical studies focusing on the influence of the educational backgrounds of board members and the CEO on financial performance are still rare in the literature. This study is among the first to address such an issue in the context of a developing economy. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A focus on preserving socioemotional wealth may influence entrepreneurial activities in family firms. In this paper, we identify the emotion of empathy in the family CEO as an antecedent of socioemotional wealth creation. We argue that the presence of one or more external directors can have a direct as well as moderating influence on the relationship between CEO's empathy and the salience of socioemotional wealth to the family CEO. Our empirical tests confirm these hypotheses. Several areas of future research are suggested to incorporate empathy and other emotions in family business studies.

This study investigates the link between female board directors and company financial performance and agency costs in Sri Lanka's publicly listed companies. In order to investigate the impact of board gender diversity on firm financial performance, a dynamic panel generalised method of moment estimation is applied. Three variables are used as proxies for gender diversity of the board of directors, namely the percentage of women on the board, a dichotomous dummy and the Blau index. A Tobit model with endogenous regressors is used to investigate the impact of female board members on agency cost, using growth opportunities as a measure of agency cost. After controlling for size, industry and other corporate governance measures, this study finds a significant negative relationship between the proportion of women on boards and firm value along with an increase in company agency cost. This evidence provides insights for governments and academic institutions in their efforts to provide resources that will help enhance women's leadership skills.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Despite growing interest in the board of directors of entrepreneurial firms, the role of outside board members in high tech start-ups has been largely neglected. This dearth of research is surprising since the high level of resource dependency these ventures face is likely to heighten the potential contribution outside board members can make. We argue that, for high tech start-ups, the service role the board plays will be crucial in overcoming resource dependencies. In contrast to existing studies that tie the outside boards' servicing role to board characteristics, we propose that greater attention needs to be paid to the resource profile of the venture. Building on resource dependency theory, we find that the extent to which the outside board members fulfil a service role is dependent on the initial human, financial and technological resource base of the entrepreneurial venture. Specifically, we find that ventures with less diversified teams, teams with lower levels of R&D experience and higher levels of financial experience and ventures earlier in the technological development process receive higher levels of support from the outside board.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

It is hypothesized in this study that the relationship between institutional ownership and inventory management is more likely to be moderated by other internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e., managerial ownership, board leadership structure and board size). This is more likely to happen as one weak governance mechanism in one area will be offset by a strong one in another area. Furthermore, the effectiveness of one corporate governance mechanism (i.e., institutional ownership) is more likely to be contingent on some contextual variables. Econometric analysis, using a sample of Egyptian listed firms, provides strong evidence for the applicability of this theme and demonstrates that institutional ownership affects inventory management positively (negatively) when managerial ownership is high (low), CEO duality (non-duality) is in place, or board size is large (small). This conclusion is robust to the use of different control variables and econometric models. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to concentrate on the prevailing agency theory along with its complementary theory of stewardship as foundations for the authors' research. Recent economic turmoil within the USA has resulted in stakeholders demanding change within governance policies of corporations. One such adjustment has been the separation of the CEO and Chairman positions within organizations. The authors' study seeks to uncover the extent to which duality CEO relationships exist in large corporations within the USA. In light of the push towards splitting the dual roles, the authors further investigated new CEOs recently appointed into the CEO position. Companies selected for this study were the top 500 revenue-producing companies in the USA as published by Fortune magazine in 2008. For comparison purposes, the authors' database included newly appointed CEOs coming on board with the original 2008 companies that had remained on the listing for both years as published by Fortune in 2010. The authors' 2008 database included 500 companies and their 2010 database included 86 companies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was the product classification used in order to establish the principal industry sector for companies under analysis. The authors' 2008 analysis reveals that 303 CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and Chairman, with 156 executives holding this combined title. The authors' 2010 analysis reveals that 33 new CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and President with 43 executives holding the title. The authors' analysis of retired CEOs reveals that 15 retired CEOs continue serving in the capacity of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Using the top 500 companies in the USA, based upon sales revenue, did limit the study to large corporations within the USA. The agency theory does provide an explanation of the duality movement witnessed in corporations. The practice of splitting duality roles of CEO and Chairman within public corporations appears to be becoming a reality within the USA, whether on a voluntary or a mandatory basis in order to enhance corporate independence and transparency.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance on the performance of 37 commercial banks in Kenya over the period 2005-2009. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two measures of performance, i.e. return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), and the dependent variables and three measures of governance - namely the board size, independent directors, and CEO duality - as the key independent variables. The study follows a panel econometrics technique to investigate the relationship between governance variables and bank performance. Findings: The main findings are as follows: a large board size tends to impact performance negatively; the existence of independent board directors tends to enhance the performance of the banks; and there is no evidence that CEO duality or otherwise has impact on the performance of commercial banks in Kenya. Practical implications: The study therefore recommends that for commercial banks in Kenya to register high performance they need to check the size of their board of directors and also increase the number of independent directors. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study on Kenya that has used advanced panel data techniques. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper examines the influence and causal relationship between board of directors independence, CEO duality, and firm value. By estimating multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, there resulted a positive influence of the percentage of independent directors on firm value, but down to a threshold of their representation of 47.23 percent, whereupon their influence becomes negative. When we employed fixed-effects models, the relationship previously mentioned was not statistically validated. However, the results provide support for a lack of statistically significant relationship between the percentage of non-executive directors and firm value. Besides, by estimating fixed-effects models we found a positive influence of CEO duality on industry-adjusted Tobin's Q ratio, but not statistically significant when estimating models without cross-sectional effects. The causal relationships between board independence and firm value identified based on Granger causality are not robust. (c) 2013, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This paper reports on the interaction of compositional effects of boards of directors (BoD) and top management teams (TMTs) on firms' financial performance. Composition of both groups is investigated for cultural, age, tenure and gender diversity. We explore effects of demographic diversity in the two power groups on performance in interaction with each other by bringing in the similarity-attraction paradigm to argue for the relationship. Study data are from consolidated financial statements in annual reports of listed Swedish corporations. Our findings suggest that while differences in gender, age and tenure diversities have no effect on firm performance, close alignment of cultural diversities of the BoD and TMT does have a positive effect of firm performance.

This paper examines the impact of board governance mechanisms, namely board size, independence ratio, opacity of earnings disclosure, and ratio of genuinely independent nonexecutive directors to total board size on director remuneration, executive tenure and likelihood of individual executive salary disclosure in a unique and comprehensive sample of 69 North African IPO firms. I find evidence of the enhanced governance role of true independent nonexecutives in family as opposed to non-family firms in improving disclosure of individual salaries and moderating lengths of executive tenure. However while their role is only significant in the context of family firms the evidence suggests that their presence is associated with higher levels of remuneration. The evidence also ascribes a greater role for business angel as opposed to more formal private equity financing which is more applicable within the highly social networked economy of the Maghreb region.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper contrasts firm-level as opposed to state-level governance on directors self-rewarding behaviour in West Africa. Director self-reward or compensation is measured through fixed base salary as well as total remuneration which provides a conservative estimate of the full private benefits of control of directors. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 56 IPO firms from across West Africa from 2000 to 2012, I find that larger board sizes have less effective governance mechanisms while enhanced expropriation of private benefits of control is closely associated with lower government promotion of private sector policies, media and analyst freedom and corruption control.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

As a result of the many governance failures in the past decade, new legislation, increased regulation, and best practices have been adopted by boards in an effort to improve corporate governance. Unfortunately, not all of the changes, such as increasing the number of external directors, have favorably impacted the quality of board governance. While having the majority of external directors on a board increases the board's independence from the CEO, these external directors lack inside directors' understanding of the firm's operations, customers and business model. The board members' lack of understanding presents a key challenge to CEOs, as their tenures depend on keeping their boards informed about the firm's business model. If CEOs are to succeed in this new governance climate, they need to find a way to effectively explain the business model to external directors in order to educate them, access their competencies, and ensure their long term support. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the strategy map to communicate the firm's business model to the board. The paper used the authors' experiences, a review of the literature, and a case study as a basis for making recommendations presented in the article. Outside directors may struggle to understand the firm's business model. While some may argue this is not the CEO's problem as it is the board's role to govern and management's job to manage, the authors argue it is an important issue for CEOs for two reasons: First, if the board does not understand the impact of changes to a firm's business model then CEOs are not fully leveraging their boards' expertise. Second, if CEOs do not keep the board adequately informed about the business model it hinders, rather than helps CEOs from building open and transparent relationships with their boards. By ensuring that directors receive the right information about the organization's business model and then have the opportunity to have a constructive dialog regarding the quality of the business model, CEOs can build trusting relationships with their boards and thus ensure they succeed over the longer term. Recent governance failures have demonstrated a need for better communication between boards and CEOs. This is one of the first papers to examine the role of the strategy map to communicate the firm's business model to the board. (c) 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

This paper undertakes a unique study of the determinants of corporate governance in the West African developing region and their impact on director compensation. A new measure of director total remuneration is constructed providing a conservative estimate of expropriation of private benefits of control. Using a hand-collected sample of 51 West African IPO firms from 2000 to 2011 we find evidence that increased presence of true independent nonexecutives that are unconnected to CEO or dominant insider groups within firm and nominally independent board level committees are highly associated with expropriation inferring that firm's with directors engaging in this behaviour are more likely to adopt measures indicative of governance best practice.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has awakened the regulators and corporates on the importance of corporate governance. In any country's economy, banking sector plays an important role for the better economy. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and disclosure quality of listed banks on Bursa Malaysia. Corporate governance variables tested in this study are the board leadership structure, board composition, board size, director ownership, institutional ownership and block ownership. The researchers developed the disclosure index and it will be checked against the information disclosed in the annual reports. Then, in calculating the weighted disclosure score, the views of accountants and financial analysts are also considered through survey questionnaire. The results reveal that better disclosure quality of the annual reports in banking sector can be achieved by having separate board leadership structure, higher proportion of independent non-executive directors, higher board size, lower ownership by the directors, institutional and block shareholders.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, 'horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

We examine the relationship between strategic change and CEO compensation by studying how a firm's refocusing program influences CEO compensation after completing the change. We contribute to the 'settling up' literature by arguing that strategic change is often uncertain for both the CEO and the board of directors responsible for executive compensation. As such the firm is likely to settle up with the CEO by paying for compensation risk and effort undertaken during refocusing after the extent and impact of strategic change are better known. We find that refocusing intensity is positively related to post-refocusing CEO total compensation, suggesting that 'settling up' through post hoc compensation is an important factor in strategic change. We also find that prior firm performance, governance structure and industry dynamism are important moderators of this relationship. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Purpose: This study aims to open up the black box of the boardroom by directly observing directors' interactions during meetings to better understand board processes.
Design/methodology/approach: We analyze videotaped observations of board meetings at two Australian companies to develop insights into what directors do in meetings and how they participate in decision-making processes. The direct observations are triangulated with semi-structured interviews, mini-surveys and document reviews.
Findings: Our analyses lead to two key fndings: while board meetings appear similar at a surface level, boardroom interactions vary significantly at a deeper level (i.e. board members participate differently during different stages of discussions), and factors at multiple levels of analysis explain differences in interaction patterns, revealing the complex and nested nature of boardroom discussions.
Research implications: Bydocumenting significant intra- and inter-board meeting differences, our study challenges the widespread notion of board meetings as rather homogeneous and monolithic, points towards agenda items as a new unit of analysis and highlights the need for more multi-level analyses in a board setting.
Practical implications: While policymakers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, our findings suggest that decision outcomes or roles' execution could be potentially affected by interactions at a board level. Differences in board meeting styles might explain prior ambiguous board structure-performance results, enhancing the need for greater normative consideration of how boards do their work.
Originality/value: This study complements existing research on boardroom dynamics and provides a systematic account of director interactions during board meetings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study examines how chief executive officer (CEO) compensation decisions may be influenced by a major group decision-making tendency referred to as group polarization among outside directors. I start by explaining why outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation when they previously witnessed relatively high (low) CEO compensation across different boards. Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority's prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors' power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it. Longitudinal analyses (1995-2006) of Fortune 500 CEOs' compensation provide support for these theoretical predictions. This study contributes to corporate governance research on CEO compensation by advancing a novel group decision-making approach to examining this important decision. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

The world-wide inflation in executive compensation in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of long-term incentives. This article demonstrates how the subjectively perceived value of long-term incentives is affected by risk aversion, uncertainty aversion, and time preferences. Based on a unique empirical study which involved collecting primary data on executive preferences from around the world, and using a theoretical framework which draws on behavioral agency theory, we conclude that, while long-term incentives are perceived by executives to be effective, they are not in fact an efficient form of reward, and that this outcome is not significantly affected by cross-cultural differences. We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of long-term incentive awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward.

Agency theory suggests that high pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) of CEO's compensation is an important motivation mechanism to the CEO to improve corporate performance. We develop a simple model that suggests that reverse causality should also be considered. Specifically, our model predicts that when good performance is expected, a powerful CEO will push for a contract with higher PPS. Data from 135 Israeli companies over a five-year period confirm the model's main prediction. Our empirical analysis shows that when the CEO is the chairman of the board of directors and thus is more powerful in affecting his compensation scheme, he achieves a high PPS in good periods (in terms of corporate performance), compared to similar powerful CEOs in periods of bad performance, and also compared to less powerful CEOs in good periods.

Purpose: Under IAS 24 a related party transaction (RPT) is a "transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged" (IASB). The purpose of this paper is to consider the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the parent company for the interpretation of the RPT. Considering the interest of the group means to interpret the intra-group transactions not as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on explanatory multiple case studies in order to answer the following research questions: why the interest of the business group and the directing activity of the subsidiaries by the parent company are important in the interpretation of RPTs. How RPTs can be interpreted in the light of the directing activity of the holding company. Findings: Dominant shareholder tends to demonstrate that the group it is not managed as a single economic entity and sometimes that subsidiaries are not really controlled. The case studies show that a regulation that imposes the transparency of the directing activity has at least two effects: the controlling shareholder finds it convenient to delegate the decision-making power and to not carry out RPTs among firms that do not present clear economic links. Thus, the transparency of the directing activity seems to be a disincentive to the establishment of a pyramidal group with expropriation purposes. Research limitations/implications: It is appropriate that the interpretation of the RPT take into account not only the disclosure of the RPT (e.g. type and nature), but also the following disclosure: the reason and the business purpose that lead to RPT; the interest of the company in engaging such transactions; and the procedures for their approval. The independence of subsidiaries directors is necessary to ensure the management autonomy of the boards, and in the case of directing activity they have to protect outsiders in the case of detrimental transactions ordered by the controlling and directing company that are not carried out in the interest of the group. Originality/value: Unlike what has been done so far by the literature on RPT, this paper considers the interest of the group to interpret the intra-group transactions and the separation between control and direction. It means do not interpret RPT as isolated transactions, as usually done by the empirical studies, but in a wider perspective, that of the group. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 139 articles on board leadership that were published in business and management journals since 1980s. Journal names, author country affiliations, topics and focus levels, theories, empirical contexts, and methodologies are presented and analysed. We also assemble and analyse this data thematically in order to identify and frame developments and trends in researchers' ideas on board leadership. This analysis provides guidance for researchers by identifying different research streams on board leadership. The analysis may also serve as basis for theory development in board leadership research that can inform policymaking and best practice recommendations.

This study analyses the influence of board composition on companies' innovation in the Spanish corporate governance system. Drawing from a multi-theoretical perspective, the analysis shows the moderating effect of board member stock ownership on the relationship between board composition and innovation. Using secondary data from a sample of Spanishquoted companies in technology industries over the 2003-2005 period, the findings demonstrate that board composition influences the innovative behaviour of firms, and that this influence is also conditioned by directors' stock ownership because directors' attitude towards innovation could vary depending on their power and on how many shares they own. These results confirm that innovation increases in firms whose boards have a high proportion of affiliated directors with significant stock ownership. This study also makes some important contributions towards creating a more effective board that can shape companies' strategic orientation, highlighting the need to consider the joint impact of board composition and ownership concentration.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This research paper examines the relationship between the board of directors and the firm's performance from the angle of the R&D investment level in the French context and from some perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to show if the R&D investment level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the size of the board, and on the other hand, the performance. This empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationships between the variables linked to the composition of the board and the firm's performance are meditated by the firm's R&D investment level.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. (c) The Authors 2014.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

This paper examines the effectiveness of six institutional quality measures, namely corruption control, effective government, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability, in inhibiting self-rewarding behaviour of boards in terms of their compensation as well as in influencing the likelihood of disclosure of individual executive salaries in IPO listings prospectuses. Using a unique and comprehensive dataset of 78 hand-collected IPO firms from across North Africa from 2000 to 2012 I find substantial evidence that government effectiveness and corruption control are important in inhibiting director self-reward and expropriation while political stability is more associated with increased likelihood of transparency in reporting of salaries. In addition firms from poor informational environments are more likely to initiate enhanced self-governance and transparency so as to overcome institutional deficiencies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the consequences of fraud for CEOs and whether these consequences depend on CEO power. We find that CEO power can reduce the likelihood of director turnover as well as CEO turnover after fraud detection. Further, we find that CEO power is negatively related to long-term stock performance after fraud detection and this negative relationship is particularly strong for powerful CEOs when the board has a low overall turnover. These results imply that powerful CEOs can entrench themselves and survive corporate turbulence by potentially working with board members who are favorable to them.

Because CEO turnover events provide the board of directors with a unique opportunity to potentially completely restructure CEO compensation packages, changes to CEO compensation following a turnover event could prove to inform the ongoing debate regarding CEO compensation. This paper investigates what happens to CEO compensation when a turnover event occurs. Specifically, I examine CEO compensation levels and pay-performance sensitivity for incoming and outgoing CEOs involved in turnover events at public companies in the United States. My main findings are as follows: (1) incoming CEOs are paid as much as or more than those they replace, (2) outsider replacements are paid more than their predecessors even after controlling for education and skills, and (3) CEOs who are forced out are not paid differently from those who replace them, while CEOs who leave voluntarily are paid significantly less than their replacements. Further analysis reveals that proxies for managerial power including CEO tenure, CEO centrality, founder status, and high CEO ownership cannot explain these results. Overall, these findings are difficult to reconcile with the view that managerial power is the primary determinant of CEO compensation.

Co-operatives are defined by the International Co-operative Alliance as 'an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise'. Under the name co-operative, very different organisations coexist: consumer co-operatives, worker co-operatives, producers' co-operatives, co-operative banks, etc. However, in spite of different contexts and businesses, co-operatives share the same principles. Their goal is triple: to defend their values; to ensure the sustainability of the organisation in a long term approach; and to ensure an equitable distribution of profits. Being a co-operative involves answering requirements such as implementing a democratic management and defining terms of membership, but also appointing a board of directors that will represent members and defend their interests in a simultaneously individual and collective perspective. Few studies exist on the specific components of the role of directors in co-operative organisations and none explores the best practices of cooperative boards that could provide lessons for other kinds of organisation. The board of directors is a key player in governance. The role of the board is to monitor management (Baysinger and Hoskisson 1990; Jensen and Zajac 2004) and to provide guidance for strategy and decision-making (Walsh and Seward 1990; Finkelstein and Hambrick 1996; Golden and Zajac 2001).

Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a "professional board" of directors. The authors utilize state-of-the-art academic literature from the fields of corporate governance and organizational behavior to evaluate the merits and de-merits of the proposed corporate governance model, and present their findings (and recommendations) for improvements in corporate governance practices.

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

Purpose: Relative performance evaluation (RPE) involves board comparisons of firm performance to that of a peer group when evaluating CEO performance. To date, research on RPE in the USA has typically relied on models where RPE is implicitly assumed. In contrast, Bannister and Newman provide some direct evidence on the explicit RPE usage by US firms showing that it is limited and there is significant inter-industry variation in its use. The authors aim to focus on why boards in some industries employ RPE to a greater extent than those in other industries do using measures of industry discretion, industry homogeneity, industry competition. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize the sample use in the Bannister and Newman study of RPE usage in industries (160 firms from the 1992 Fortune 250 with proxy statements for 1992 and 1993). The authors compile measures of industry membership (using SIC codes), industry discretion, industry homogeneity, and industry competition from Compustat a well. Multiple regression is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that the use of RPE at the industry level is significantly related to industry discretion (i.e. the degree of latitude that managers have over strategic and operational choices in the particular industry environment) and industry homogeneity, but not to industry competition. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited in terms of a dated sample (necessary to be consistent with the Bannister and Newman paper). It would bear updating. In addition, multi-year panel data could be used to generate more robust results. It would also be useful to replicate the study in other national (and hence governance) contexts. Practical implications: The findings should help boards when deciding how to reward or punish CEOs and top managers for their firm performance by filtering out relative performance in a more rational manner (e.g. by taking relevant industry context into account). Originality/value: In terms of originality, this is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, that investigates RPE at the industry level. It is valuable because industry discretion is an important contextual variable that a board of directors will find useful in evaluating managers since this type of discretion is beyond managerial control.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

The main objective of this paper is to explore the role of family councils vis-a-vis corporate governance mechanisms. Particularly, the paper explores whether family councils perform only their distinctive family governance role or if they also substitute for the roles performed by corporate governance control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 243 Italian family SMEs, our research findings show that the family council partially substitutes the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors in playing their respective corporate governance roles of ownership and monitoring. These findings are interpreted in the light of both agency and relational perspectives. (c) 2013 International Council for Small Business.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other "LGBT-friendly" policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

In this study we examine the relationship between board diversity in terms of member background and personality (deep-level diversity) and board creativity and cognitive conflict, controlled for the mediating role of board members' interactions. Using a sample of 385 Norwegian companies, the results provide strong support for the notion that the higher the level of board diversity with respect to the board members' backgrounds and personalities, the higher the degree of board creativity and cognitive conflict during the decision-making process. Moreover, our empirical evidence supports the mediating role of interactions among board members. The study supports the increasing importance of going beyond "surface level diversity" (e.g., diversity in term of gender) and investigating characteristics that are less visible and that are labelled "deep-level" diversity attributes.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

Innovation is critical for nonprofit organizations' effective response to changing environmental conditions. While the board of directors, which has the ultimately responsibility for leadership and governance of nonprofit organizations, is in a position to facilitate the development of such capacity, theoretical and empirical literature on this link is very limited and originates primarily in developed world countries, limiting its generalizability and usefulness to other national contexts. The author of this article sought to contribute to the growing literature on boards and innovation by (1) discussing potential usefulness of a Western conceptual model--Board of directors and innovation in nonprofit organizations (Jaskyte, Human services as complex organizations, 2012)--to other contexts, more specifically those of developing countries and (2) providing preliminary empirical evidence for the links presented in the model from nonprofit organizations in developing countries. Five representatives of four social service nonprofit organizations in developing countries known for their continuous innovation were interviewed in order to gain some insights into the board's role in facilitating innovation. While limited, preliminary data provide support for the importance of board attribute and process variables for organization's capacity for continuous innovation, and suggest that considering cultural contexts when assessing usefulness of established models might be paramount.

Purpose - The financial crisis of 2008-2009 was truly global in nature that affected all sectors and countries of the world. Being considered that a board of directors is the main governance mechanism through which a company is governed and managed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the governance structure of a company on its financial performance during the period of financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates the effect of board structure parameters - board leadership, directors and board size on the financial performance for 164 non-financial listed firms in India during the period of financial crisis of 2008-2009. Findings - The study finds a significant positive effect with Chief Executive Officer duality, executive chairperson and proportion of inside directors on the firm's financial performance. Independent directors have no significant influence, while non-executive (grey) director's being affiliated with the firm has a negative influence on firm's financial performance. A larger board has a negative relationship with the firm's financial performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to large non-financial firms of the Bombay Stock Exchange-200 index. The study may be extended to include other firms to generalize the findings. Practical implications - Results imply that during the period of financial distress, a company having more inside (or management) directors with an executive chairperson are in a better position to manage company resources with positive impact on financial performance. Companies with larger boards may find it difficult to take quick decisions, which ultimately affect their performance. Originality/value - The study is original in its idea of assessing company strategy to adopt a suitable governance structure that can sustain its performance during the period of financial crisis.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

This study examines the relationship between ownership structure and performance of public firms in Mexico, considering debt and the structure of the board of directors as contextual and institutional factors. This research seeks to explain the mixed results about the relationship of ownership and performance presented by other relevant studies in family and non-family businesses, mainly in emerging countries. The results confirm the positive association between family ownership concentration and performance, calculated by Tobin's Q, showing how the participation of inside shareholders on the board and a low debt level contribute to higher performance. However, the association of these variables with performance shows a contrasting effect in the case of family as compared to non-family businesses. The particular corporate legal context in Mexico could be highlighted as one of the main reasons for these results. (c) 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Top management teams frequently overemphasize efforts to exploit the current product portfolio, even in the face of the strong need to step up exploration activities. This mismanagement of the balance between explorative R&D activities and exploitation of the current product portfolio can result in the so-called success trap, the situation where explorative activities are fully suppressed. The success trap constitutes a serious threat to the long-term viability of a firm. Recent studies of publicly traded corporations suggest that the suppression of exploration arises from the interplay among the executive team's myopic forces, the board of directors as gatekeeper of the capital market, and the exploitation-exploration investments and their outcomes. In this paper, system dynamics modeling serves to identify and test ways in which top management teams can counteract this suppression process. For instance, we find that when the executive board is suppressing exploration, the board of directors can still prevent the success trap by actively intervening in the exploitation-exploration strategy.

Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on individual directors' economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The discrepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board's dynamic, team task performance efficacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on firm profitability. Our findings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction - thereby lowering information asymmetry - have a significant impact on corporate profitability. Our study demonstrates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on profitability, while the focus on compliance-oriented tasks has a significantly negative effect on profitability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improving board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

This study seeks to contribute to the debate on board behavior by investigating how deeper-level diversity, specifically differences in personality, interacts with demographic diversity to explain board cognitive and affective conflict. Using survey data from a pilot study of 98 directors in 16 UK boards, we show that dissimilarities in personality traits are negatively related to cognitive conflict, but this relationship is moderated by gender and tenure diversity. Personality differences do not explain affective conflict. The study provides insights into how theories from psychology may help us understand antecedents to board behaviors.

Corporate governance significantly effects corporate performance and this relationship is established through number of studies theoretically and empirically conducted in this field. Also, there are studies which show the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital performance. Furthermore, intellectual capital performance positively effects corporate performance as shown in the previous studies. These relationships trigger this study to explore the role of intellectual capital as a mediator between corporate governance and corporate performance relationship. This study focuses on the idea that governance measures, board of directors in this study, can contribute to the intellectual capital efficiency of the companies which in turn results in higher corporate performance. A single structural model of corporate governance, intellectual capital and corporate performance is conceptualized. In the model, board of directors, variables are taken as governance measures, Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAICTM) as intellectual capital performance measure and traditional financial measures as corporate performance measures. It is intellectual capital resources which act as mechanism through which the corporate governance is able to influence the corporate performance. Intellectual capital is taken as mediator to confirm that IC properly mediates the CG and performance relationship conceptually. This study will be beneficial for the research community to combine different areas of study under one model. This study will suggest the management and other regulatory bodies to understand the importance of intellectual capital along with governance and performance.

The objective of this article is twofold: identify the primary board characteristics that drive the quality of MFI governance and link governance quality to microfinance institutions' outreach performance. We measure governance quality with the governance rating score provided by Planet Rating, one of the agencies that specialize in the rating of microfinance institutions. The study focuses on an independently pooled cross-section sample of 178 MFIs rated by Planet Rating from 2001 to 2011. Findings obtained after controlling for selection bias suggest that board expertise, board activity, and ownership type are the main board characteristics that significantly determine the quality of MFI governance. Findings seem to be robust when we change the measurement of board size and ownership type. Moreover, MFIs with an effective governance system tend to serve large numbers of customers.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Within corporate governance the accountability of the board of directors is identified as a major issue by governments, international bodies, professional associations and academic literature. Boards are given significant power in companies, and as a consequence it is argued that they should be accountable for their actions. Drawing on political science, public administration, accounting, and ethics literature, this book examines the concept of accountability and its meaning in the corporate governance context. It examines the rationale for making boards accountable, and outlines the obstacles and drawbacks involved in providing for accountability. The book goes on to examine how current mechanisms for ensuring accountability are assessed in terms of fairness, justice, transparency, practicality, effectiveness and efficiency, before discussing the ways that accountability might be improved. Andrew Keay argues that enhanced accountability can provide better corporate governance, helping to reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises, and improve confidence in company practice. As an in depth study of a key element within the exercise of authority and management in corporate entities, this book will be of great use and interest to researchers and students of corporate governance, business and management, and corporate social responsibility.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the moderating effects of a board of directors on foreign direct investment (FDI)'s international diversification in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of Turkish multinational firms with FDI was used. Two different aspects of international diversification were considered: the relationship between international diversification and financial performance and the moderating effect of board composition on the relationship between international diversification and the firm's financial performance. Firm-level data were obtained from the Istanbul Stock Exchange in Turkey. Findings: The findings reveal that international diversification leads to better financial performance according to market-based measures. On the other hand, this study indicates that the board characteristics have a moderating effect on international diversification and financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a sample of publicly listed firms in Turkey, and this restriction limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: The internalization efforts of Turkish FDI have led to better financial performance in terms of market-based measures. The results have stated that the interest of independent outside directors is aligned with lower-risk investment decisions. Independence of independent outside directors in Turkey is interrogated by practitioners or the Capital Markets Board of Turkey. The larger board size which a moderator variable is provided, the wider shareholder value in Turkey is. Social implications: One can understand that the development of market-supporting institutions provides the support for entry to an emerging economy which is inefficient or incomplete markets and highly concentrated family ownership. Originality/value: These findings provide important implications for corporate governance and highlight the need for further research on the role of governance in firm internationalization. This study not only helps to understand how board characteristics affect the choice of international diversification decisions, but the results also allow to assess the performance implications of these choices for a particular period.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine whether a firm's operating environment influences the likelihood that the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors. Specifically, using robust regression techniques, we find that when a firm has greater advisory needs and is more reliant on managerial initiatives for innovation, the firm is more likely to appoint its CEO as the chair. We also examine whether CEO-Chairs use their greater bargaining power from holding dual positions to benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders. We find no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs are more likely to extract rents compared to CEOs who are not chairs. Collectively, these findings indicate that the decision by firms to appoint their CEOs as chairs is determined by the firms' operating environment and that there is no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs use their power from holding dual positions to the detriment of shareholders.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

This research examines the relationship between the board of directors and firm's performance through the R&D investment-level in the French context from perspectives of corporate governance. Our model seeks to identify if the R&D investment-level acts as a mediating variable between, on the one hand, the dominance of outside directors, the dual structure and the board size, and secondly, the performance. The empirical study is based on a sample of 178 French firms for the period 2008-2012. The results of the linear regressions conducted show that the relationship between boards composition linked variables and the firm performance are meditated by the firm R&D investment-level.

This study analyzes the effect of directors' human and external social capital on the monitoring and resource provision tasks of the board. Furthermore, this study examines the moderating effect of cognitive and affective conflicts among the directors on these relationships. Based on a sample of 92 cases, we find that the human and external social capital of the directors is positively associated with board's monitoring and resource provision tasks. The results suggest that cognitive conflict positively moderates the relationship between directors' external social capital with the monitoring and negatively with the resource provision tasks. Affective conflict was found to moderate the relationship between directors' external social capital and the resource provision tasks negatively, and positively moderate the relationship between directors' human capital and resource provision tasks. This study suggests that the behavioral perspective, which takes into account the dynamics and interaction in the board, has considerable predictive power. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The compensation received by directors has attracted the interest on good corporate governance practices related to remuneration matters, with particular emphasis on the need to link the remuneration of directors and the business performance. However, the question remains whether this relationship is being implemented or, on the contrary, we must address through other measures that encourage directors' remunerations more in line with the shareholders' interests. The analysis of a sample of 76 Spanish firms over the period 2004-2009 shows the existence of this relationship if book based indicators are taken as a reference. However, this relation does not exist with those indicators made according to market data. These results should make researchers and regulators think about the need for new ways of remuneration that convey confidence to compensation systems. (c) Virtus interpress 2015.

Classical economic theories establishing a relationship between CEO remuneration and firm performance has paid particular attention to solve conflict of interest between managerial team and firm shareholders, by designing an optimum CEO remuneration that motivate executives to work in the best interest of shareholders. Many international and less Australian empirical researches suggest that there is overwhelming evidence that firm performance is strongly linked with CEO remuneration. In this paper, we reassess the association of firm performance and CEO remuneration variables using dynamic econometric models and comprehensive data from Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We find a positive and strong association between CEO pay of top 200 Australian public listed companies and company performance. Obtained findings are similar to USA, UK and Canada studies results. We further test the effect of board and ownership features on CEO remuneration-performance sensitivity in the top 200 Australian public companies listed on ASX. Specifically, for the period of 2003-2007, our results highlight the importance of ownership structure in influencing remuneration-performance relationship. Monitoring block holders boost the responsiveness of long term incentives (LTI) remuneration to performance, thus straightening shareholder and manager welfares. However, based on a short term investment horizon strategy, insider block holders increase (decrease) the sensitivity of short-term incentives remuneration (long term incentives pay). Surprisingly, for the period 2008-2013, our findings suggest that ownership and board features did not influence significantly CEO pay-performance sensitivities. Finally, we find that larger boards increase (decrease) the responsiveness of CEO's known remuneration (long term incentives) to performance. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The funding of defined-benefit plans has garnered the attention of academicians, practitioners, and policymakers. Drawing upon agency and organizational control theories, this study investigates the implications of board independence on changes in defined-benefit funding. Using a panel dataset of S&P 500 companies sponsoring defined-benefit plans, the author finds that corporate boards matter. Specifically, CEO duality and outside director representation are associated with year-to-year decreases in defined-benefit funding. Conversely, outside director ownership is related to year-to-year increases in defined-benefit funding. Furthermore, outside director ownership moderated the relationship between outside director representation and defined-benefit funding such that outside director representation is associated with year-to-year increases in defined-benefit plan funding when the percentage of outside director ownership is high.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While US companies mainly list their board of directors alphabetically, this is not the case for Chinese companies, most of which list their independent directors last. We interpret the listing order of Chinese directors as board hierarchy, reflecting power allocation within the board. Based on extant evidence that independent directors contribute to firm value and that empowered individuals have more influence in group decision making, we expect independent-director rankings to be positively associated with firm value and find evidence consistent with this prediction. In our supplementary analyses we explore the mechanisms through which empowered independent directors enhance firm value. We find that independent directors who are ranked higher are more likely to vote against the management, especially on financial reporting issues. Further, higher independent-director rankings are associated with less earnings management. Our study suggests that empowering independent directors increases firm value. (c) 2016

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

This study examines how firms use benchmarking information about peers to determine the compensation that they offer to chief executive officers (CEOs). It jointly addresses two distinct perspectives: pay equity and managerial power. Pay inequity provides strong motivation for CEOs to restore equity, by promoting the logic of external fairness and urging boards of directors to implement peer benchmarking and adjust the focal CEO's compensation levels. Although pay inequity may motivate CEOs to restore equity, their reaction to inequity may be effective only when they have sufficient power over the board of directors to influence the pay-setting process. Results from a sample of 1,555 CEOs generally support predictions about the moderating effects of CEO power in the relationship between a focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay. The compensation for underpaid CEOs with relatively greater power over the board is associated with their peers' compensation, suggesting that peer benchmarking is more aggressively used to adjust CEO compensation upward. For overpaid CEOs, the relationship between the focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay is weaker when the CEOs have greater influence over the board, suggesting that such CEOs are able to avoid the use of benchmarking and downward adjustments of pay.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' composition (independent directors' ratio, board size, CEO-duality) and financial transparency and disclosure (T&D). Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes board composition and financial T&D of Italian listed companies using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The results of this paper show a significant link between board composition and the level of financial T&D. In particular, the authors found a positive and significant relationship between the independent directors' ratio and the level of financial T&D and a negative relationship between board size and the level of financial T&D. Research limitations/implications: While this paper focuses on a sample of 100 Italian listed companies, the authors acknowledge the importance of extending the results to other national context and to other type of firms (e.g. non-listed firms or SMEs). Moreover, while this paper concerns the amount of information disclosed by firms, it does not look at the quality or accuracy of disclosure. Practical implications: This paper reveals the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms (such as board composition) in enhancing the level of financial T&D. Indeed, the authors provide some indications to firms to improve their internal governance mechanisms (e.g. the importance of high proportion of independent directors and of small- and medium-sized boards of directors). Originality/value: This paper provides interesting insights to firms which are under pressure to improve the level of information to stakeholders. Moreover, has the level of information that is not legally required vary among companies and countries, the authors shed light on a context characterized by high level of ownership concentration, where firms can experience different types of conflict of interests.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

We study the effect of board size on firm value in Australia. Using a large sample of Australian firms over the period 2001-2011, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship. We show that firms with a large board are associated with CEO compensation that is sensitive to firm size, but not to firm performance. This incentive to accumulate assets is congruent with the fact that firms with a large board also exhibit lower operating performance and higher operating costs. Furthermore, we find that the effect of board size is stronger in small firms. This result might explain why earlier studies, which focused on large Australian firms, found board size to have little impact on firm value. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study examines the role of the top management team (TMT) and governance structures in the use of corporate venture capital (CVC) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO). The study is unique in that it sheds light on governance-related antecedents of strategic decision making in such firms. We integrate the insights of behavioral agency and upper echelon perspectives to develop our hypotheses. Our results show that in the presence of non-duality, a negative curvilinear relationship exists between TMT heterogeneity and the use of CVC. We also find that TMT heterogeneity and ownership motivate the use of CVC but only up to a certain threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures of entrepreneurship and strategy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

Grounded in the strategic leadership literature and upper echelons theory, this study proposes that founder CEOs tend to take more risks than agent CEOs because of the former's overconfidence. We further suggest that the relationship between founder CEO status and firm risk taking can be moderated by certain internal or external factors that influence just how overconfident a CEO might be. Our theoretical predictions are well supported by a large survey data set on Chinese CEOs. Specifically, the positive relationship between founder CEO status and firm risk taking weakens when the CEO is younger, when the CEO also chairs the board of directors, and when the CEO's task environment is less uncertain, less complex, and more munificent.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to account for the internationalization of restaurants. The conceptual framework of upper echelons theory is applied to identify the demographic determinants of internationalization among chief executive officers (CEOs). Design/methodology/approach: Data from 30 restaurant firms for the period 1999-2013 were collected from a variety of sources, primarily Compustat and Execucomp, based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 5812, the annual 10-K and public information. A panel feasible generalized least squares model was used as the main instrument of analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that the CEO gender and share ownership negatively affect the internationalization of restaurant companies, whereas size, the extent of franchising, the type of restaurant and stock options positively affect the degree of internationalization. Additionally, an inverted U-shaped relation exists between CEO tenure and the degree of internationalization. Practical implications: The presented information may provide shareholders and boards of directors with valuable guidelines regarding the assignment of appropriate managers depending on the extent to which their companies are pursuing internationalization strategies. Originality/value: Most studies in hospitality sectors have focused only on accounting-based measures to explain strategic decision-making, although proponents of upper echelons theory have argued that CEO attributes influence strategic decisions/changes. This study contributes to the literature on hospitality by identifying the effects of CEO characteristics on internationalization decisions. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance issues are critical in university spin-offs because, since their substantially knowledge and technology-driven nature, investments are characterized by rapid growth and real investment opportunities, affecting innovative activity too. In this view, the paper investigate the role of the board of directors' composition on innovation performance of university spin-offs. Based on a panel sample of 478 Italian university spin-offs, the results show that board size has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with innovation, remarking that not too large boards are more efficient and work better, influencing in a positive way the innovation activity of the spin-off. Regarding the impact of the outside directors, the results seems to invalidate its positive and significant effect on innovation performance. Also the CEO-duality seems to have no influence on the innovative activity. These findings may represent potential indicators of the optimal configuration for board in university spin-offs in order to improve innovation.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

This paper assesses Andrew Pettigrew's contribution to management scholarship. This review addresses the process, content, and context of his research career. Chronologically, the process will be subdivided into three distinct phases: the period leading up to the establishment of the Centre for Corporate Strategy and Change, Pettigrew's time with the Centre, and Pettigrew's research since leaving the Centre. The content of Pettigrew's research focussed on big problems and emerging phenomena such as decision-making, organisational culture, organisation development, strategic change, human resource management, competitiveness, new public management, boards of directors, innovative forms of organising, high-performing research teams, and business schools. His contextualist methodology for process research will be explicated. Pettigrew's contribution will be contextualised by comparing it with contemporary research. The paper concludes that there is still a need not only to examine big problems and emerging phenomena but also to provide a processual understanding of management reality. There is a need to further develop process research methodologies such as Pettigrew's contextualism, especially with respect to process research methods.

This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and 'increased career risks' perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country's culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

This paper investigates the link between the board composition and the corporate diversification decisions of 50 large UK listed corporations over the period from 2005 to 2015. The panel data analysis integrates changes in board composition and its dynamic effect on the extent of diversification. We find that increased board independence influences the extent of both unrelated and related diversification. Neither institutional representatives nor extra-industry interlocking directors influence the extent of diversification in ways which promote shareholders' interests. The findings support corporate governance policy promoting board independence. In contrast, these findings suggest extending the involvement of institutional investors to board representation may not mitigate agency problems in large companies.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

The current study examines the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on corporate financial performance (CFP). Prior studies document a positive CSR-CFP association without considering the moderating effects of chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics such as compensation incentives and tenure. Our results show evidence of a positive association between CSR and CFP only in the firms managed by short-tenured, high-cash paid CEOs and particularly during an industry's cooling-off period. The results imply that the incentives embedded in the current CEO pay are not effective and CEOs use CSR as a compensation management tool to increase their share-based pay. To encourage a CEO to implement CSR engagement, particularly during an industry's boom period, the board of directors should decrease common-share payments and increase the CEO's option payments. In addition, the proportion of cash compensation in the CEO's total compensation should not be reduced. (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines the degree to which senior executive members of a school's decision-making team (senior management team and board of directors) are aligned on fundamental principles of school strategy. Our study is based on a conceptual framework of strategic leadership as it applies in an Australian independent school context. We also examine the differences between the senior management team and board of directors based on top management team (TMT) tenure heterogeneity, and how these differences account for TMT associations with school strategy. Implications for research and practice complete the study. The terms top management team, senior management team, and senior leadership team are used interchangeably in this article.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the non-financial causes of organizational success or failure, provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes exploratory case studies in investigating the relationship of non-financial factors to organizational success or failure across a sample of sector-specific Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. A two-tailed study was designed, in which seven cases from both extremes were chosen from three Australian business sectors: finance, property and manufacturing. Findings - Non-financial factors associated with the organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included management skill, experience and involvement in organizational strategy, feedback and resultant activity, together with board of director composition. The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes could be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure. Research limitations/implications - The use of this method is very time-consuming but is highly valuable in case study research, providing a more in-depth understanding of how non-financial factors impact organizational success or failure. Practical implications - The research will provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. The improvement in prediction of organizational failure will reduce the costs of failure to all areas affected, from the large corporation to the small business. The inter-connectivity of all businesses to each other often results in a knock-on effect of failure with the cost being borne by all members of the community in some manner. The level of social impact and cost of failure can only be seen by the enormous costs of the Global Financial Crisis failures. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on effective qualitative research and explores important areas of consideration for those conducting qualitative multiple-case studies. It is intended to be of use to researchers investigating the area of predictors of organizational failure or success. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by the board of directors. Yet while much research explores how firm performance, governance structures, and types of succession affect the appointment decision, we have less understanding of the influence of contextual factors such as external constituents. This paper is the first to explore how one key constituent -investment analysts -may shape the appointment decision, specifically through serving as an information intermediary for the board. Because CEO succession creates uncertainty regarding the firm's future leadership and its strategic direction, I propose that investment analysts, as knowledgeable experts who provide research coverage on the firm, provide the board with information that is likely to influence their selection of a new CEO. In addition, I argue that because analysts are recognized as having expertise regarding the future performance of the firm, the board is likely to select a CEO in order to appease these critical stakeholders. Using panel data on S & P 500 companies for the 2000-2005 periods, I find evidence that analyst recommendations convey information about a firm's top management and the appropriateness of its strategy that is reflected in the appointment decision. Specifically, I find that more negative analyst ratings lead to a higher probability that the board will appoint an outsider CEO and also make the board more likely to appoint a high status CEO.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

Despite knowing the potential effect of social reporting on firms' continuity, there is limited research into the influence of the composition of boards of directors on CSR disclosure. This paper adds to the emerging CSR literature empirical evidence by examining how board composition relates to a firm's social and environmental disclosure as well as the implementation of social policies. Using a sample of FTSE 350 firms for the period 2007-2012, the results show that higher board independence facilitates the conveying of firms' good citizenship image through enhancing societal conscience. The results also show that female participation on boards is favorably affecting CSR engagement and reporting as well as the establishment of ethical policies. Hence, the research suggests that boards with higher female participation and independence boost the legitimacy of CSR reporting. Board gender diversity and independence facilitates directing part of the firm's scarce resources toward value maximizing social projects and subsequent reporting on these.

This paper investigates whether female independent directors are more likely to impose high dividend payouts. We find evidence that firms with a larger fraction of female directors on their board have greater dividend payouts. This finding is robust to alternative econometric specifications, and alternative measures of dividend payouts and female board representation. The positive effect of board gender composition on dividends remains when we employ propensity score matching, the instrumental variable approach, and difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that board gender composition significantly increases the dividend payout only for firms with weak governance, suggesting that female directors use dividend payouts as a governance device.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the state of S&P 500 companies' transparency by analyzing their Bloomberg ESG (Environmental-Social-Governance) disclosure scores. Additionally, the effects of industry sector, firm size, and governance practices on transparency are examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data were retrieved from Bloomberg using the financial analysis environmental, social and governance function for companies comprising the S&P 500 index. Descriptive statistics are provided on each of the three components separately (ESG). Nonparametric procedures are used to test for significant differences in transparency within each of these three areas based on industry sector. Additionally, nonparametric tests are used to determine the impact of firm size (market capitalization) and governance factors (board size, board gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, and linking executive compensation to ESG disclosure) on the composite ESG score. Findings: Descriptive statistics reveal that S&P 500 companies differ in their level of disclosure across the three areas (ESG). The highest level of transparency is found on Governance and the lowest on Environmental. Moreover, there is much variability in the percentage of S&P 500 companies disclosing information about specific Social policies (e.g. child labor). Significant differences in transparency on both the Social and Governance dimensions are found between certain industry sectors. The results also reveal that large-cap companies have significantly higher ESG disclosure scores than mid-cap companies and that governance factors impact ESG disclosure. Significantly, higher ESG disclosure scores are observed for S&P 500 firms with larger boards of directors, with boards that are more gender diverse, that allow CEO duality, and that link executive compensation to ESG scores. Originality/value: This study focuses on corporate transparency through a granular analysis of ESG disclosure scores when most other studies have been primarily conducted at the macro level. Stakeholders, analysts, and shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing firms' sustainability disclosures in their assessment of management quality, as it reflects on the practices/policies that are employed to improve firms' environmental and social footprints.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Purpose: This study is guided by the upper echelon theory and argues that the role of females on boards of directors may differ between cultures. In a culture where the community has a significant humane orientation, female directors may pay much more attention to the social issues of corporate sustainability rather than environmental issues. Therefore, this study aims to differentiate between the social and environmental performances of companies to examine whether the presence of females on the boards of directors of Malaysian firms could affect social and environmental performances differently. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of firms listed in Bursa Malaysia and develops two disclosure indices to measure social and environmental performances. Three proxies of female directors are used in the empirical models. The ordinary least square model is used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The empirical results suggest a positive association between social performance and the presence of female directors on the board of directors of Malaysian firms. However, no association was found between environmental performance and the presence of female directors on those boards. These results confirm the prediction of this study that the female directors of Malaysian firms pay more attention to social issues than to environmental ones. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the effects of the presence of female directors on Malaysian firms' boards of directors on social and environmental performance. It also contributes to the upper echelon theory by illuminating the importance of gender diversity in influencing the social and environmental behaviors of corporate leaders. The results provide the important implication that the association between a firm's social and environmental performance and gender diversity depends on the culture within which the company operates.

Prior research on post-acquisition performance suggests positive, negative, or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms. Grounding our arguments on the extended resource-based view, the current article proposes that business group-affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long-term acquisition performance, relative to standalone firms, especially in emerging economies such as India. Additionally, we hypothesize that both within-group heterogeneity, manifested as prior group experience, group diversification, and intra-group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors, also affect the long-term post-acquisition performance of affiliated firms. The findings, obtained with a buy-and-hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions, both domestic and cross-border, by Indian firms during 2005-2013, provide robust support for the theoretical arguments.

The concept of greed is one of the oldest social constructs; however, greed as a managerial attribute that affects firm outcomes has yet to attract scholarly attention in management. In this study, we examine the relationship of CEO greed to shareholder wealth. After anchoring greed to familiar constructs in organizational literature, we test our hypotheses on a sample of over 300 publicly traded firms from multiple industries. As predicted, greed has a negative relationship with shareholder return, but this relationship is moderated by the presence of a powerful, independent board, managerial discretion, and CEO tenure. The contributions of this study, which include refining our understanding of self-interest and opportunism, developing the greed construct, and illustrating its impact on shareholder wealth, are intended to open a new line of inquiry in the management literature.

Research summary: This study examines the relationship between an independent director's death and CEO acquisitiveness. Using a sample of large U.S. public firms, we find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death undertake fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of posttraumatic growth theory that mortality awareness can induce CEOs to reevaluate their life priorities and reduce the importance of extrinsic goals in their decision making. This study contributes to the strategic leadership literature by highlighting the influence of the death of CEOs' social peers on CEOs' strategic decisions. Managerial summary: Does the death of CEOs' social peers influence CEOs' strategic decisions? We find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death engage in fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. One likely explanation for our findings is that the death of an independent director may heighten CEOs' mortality awareness, lead the CEOs to pursue a quieter life, and weaken their propensities for undertaking decisions (i.e., acquisitions) that increase their compensation and social status.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the association between board demographics and firm financial performance of Karachi Stock Exchange companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The connection between board structure and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the relationship between board structure and the performance of Pakistani public listed companies by using a sample of Karachi Stock Exchange 100 (KSE-100) indexed companies. This study exploits the corporate performance by accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q), and economic profit (economic value added). Findings: The outcome of the study shows the positive relationship between the board size, minority representation in board, and family director's in-board and firm performance. The authors also find that, instead of adding value, independent directors in Pakistan are negatively associated with firm value. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on KSE-100 indexed companies from 2009 to 2013; however, a large sample and multiple years' data are required. Practical implications: The paper provides empirical evidence that board independence is not necessary for public-listed companies in Pakistan and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance and firm performance by introducing a framework for identifying and analyzing moderating variables that affect the relationship between board structure and firm performance.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The role of the nomination committee (NC) in the selection of members of various ethnic groups for board membership has increased significantly as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008. A company board that comprises directors who come from all the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian Malaysians) increases the efficiency of the board in its monitoring and advising roles. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012), the NC shall be responsible for the appointment and recognition of candidates of diverse backgrounds into the board and committee. With that in mind, this paper examines the presence of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors in a nomination committee and its impact on the ethnic diversity of its board. This paper also examines the influence of the executive directors who are members in the nomination committee on the nomination process. For this purpose, 393 (50%) Malaysian listed companies were selected from the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Only non-financial companies were included because other companies such as finance have a different set of regulations in Malaysia. In this study, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression were used for the purpose of revealing important significance of the variables used. In order to control possible endogeneity issues, the GMM estimator was also administered. The regression results of the ethnic diversity model are statistically significant, showing that, a higher proportion of Malay and Chinese directors in a nomination committee has negative relationships while a higher proportion of Indian directors in a nomination committee increases their representation on the board. However, the proportion of executive directors in the nomination committee was found to have a significant impact on the director nomination process of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors. In order to test the robustness of the model, several sets of measures were used. In conclusion, it is deduced that the results of this study support the social identity theory and power struggle, it shows the importance of diversity within the nominating committee of Malaysian companies. The result also reveals that unbiased and effective board mix enhances the strategic decision-making process of the board.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

A wealth of governance research has examined CEO successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. Despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. In this article, we investigate whether disruptive CEO successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. We focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. We leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are--in practice--viewed as normative violations. We theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim CEOs and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. However, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise CEO departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board's decision to rely on an interim CEO. Our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded U.S. firms provides support for these arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study relates a firm's cash holdings and their value to the board of directors' level of education. Using a sample of firms on the Taiwan Stock Exchange during the period from 2006 to 2012, we find that firms with a highly educated board tend to hold more cash and are associated with a higher value of cash. This fact is especially evident among financially constrained firms. Our findings suggest that highly educated boards provide more efficient monitoring and advisory functions, and thus complement corporate governance.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

This study applies a new multi-focal actor-centered institution-theoretic approach to examine the association between executive pay and the recruitment of social elites to the board of directors in developing countries. We use a sample of 119 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 17 African stock markets to model this relationship. The results suggest that a higher proportion of elites on the board is associated with lower executive pay. This is moderated by institutional quality; that is, lower institutional quality is associated with more directors drawn from social elites and with higher pay, while the opposite is true in higher-institutional-quality environments. Our findings confirm the importance of the social environment within which governance is embedded. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO's dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-a-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO-TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO's delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors.

There is limited research based on the perspective of neo-institutional that examines the cognitive pressures related to green management practices. The current study examined the relationship between the past environmental related experiences which one of the cognitive dimensions of leader in public listed company and its relationship with positive deviance behaviour in green management practices. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between the past environmental related experiences of the board of directors and positive deviance behaviour in green management practices; however for CEO's past environmental related experiences and its interaction effect with board of director's past environmental experiences are otherwise. This study reveals that the understanding regarding the intersection between sound corporate governance and green management practices is very important in companies deviating positively in green management practices.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

We investigate the internal workings of US corporate governance with a hand-collected dataset of director resignations that are related to power struggles within the board. About two-thirds of the conflicts arise because of how board members interact in carrying out their duties, while most of the remaining cases involve disagreements between directors and top management over corporate strategy or financial policy. Conflicts are more likely to occur at companies where the CEO is the founder or is relatively new to the position. Tensions also increase when there are independent directors with large blockholdings. Stock prices decline sharply on average after a director turnover amid dispute, which may indicate that investors expect the firm to continue to have poor operating performance. The aftermath of such a resignation often includes shareholder class-action lawsuits, proxy contests, asset divestitures, and stock market delistings. Our results highlight the importance of a well-functioning board for reducing agency problems and maximizing shareholder value. (c) 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

This study aims to analyze the effect of gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, as well as the effect of education background of the President Commissioner on the firm value. Gender diversity is measured from the proportion of women in Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors, while the education background is measured by the education background of the President Commissioner. In this research, the firm value is measured by Tobins Q. The sample used in this study consist of 70 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange in the year 2012. This study employs multiple linear regression to draw the research results. The analysis results show that gender diversity in both the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors significantly affects firm value. On the contrary, the education background of the President Commissioner does not affect firm value. This result support the argument that diversity of boards will, through various ways, affect firm financial value in the long and short term.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research has confirmed private firm performance as a predictor of executive turnover, but whether this relationship holds in other organizational contexts--especially those operating without a profit-distribution requirement--is not known. For nonprofit organizations, performance monitoring and governance largely occur behind closed doors under the leadership of a volunteer board of directors. Nonprofits are commonly criticized as inefficient, even ineffective, and the accountability of boards and executives for organizational performance has not been sufficiently investigated. This article engages a unique dataset of 998 U.S.-based nonprofits serving missions related to the arts, health, and human services, and uses a multiple-spell discrete-time hazard model to evaluate nonprofit financial performance and the likelihood of executive turnover. The findings provide preliminary support that tenure in the executive office is sensitive to nonprofit financial performance, and in doing so, they raise new insights about the accountability of nonprofit executives.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how information-processing mechanisms between nominating committees (NCs), incumbent executives, board chairs, and shareholders affect the comprehensiveness of executive succession processes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an explanatory multiple-case study that comprises eight CEO and CFO succession cases in large German publicly traded firms. Findings: The findings reveal that comprehensiveness is determined by four key information-processing mechanisms: the effectiveness of NC's information sharing, absorbing disagreement, and integrating heterogeneous opinions; board chair leadership (i.e. an apprentice board leadership structure in association with the board chair's openness to ideas); the breadth and depth of information sharing between executives and NCs; and the extent and timing to which major shareholders influence succession processes. Research limitations/implications: The authors summarize the findings in a conceptual framework and develop a set of propositions to guide future research on the topic. Such studies may want to test the suggestions in a quantitative way, preferably in a multinational context. Originality/value: The authors' emerging conceptual framework contributes a set of information-processing variables by which NCs engage in comprehensive executive successions with incumbent executives, board chairs, and major shareholders and offers a multiechelon approach to study executive successions.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the effects of competing influences emanating from firms' social structural context (i.e. sent and received board of director interlocks and industry peers) on the adoption of an institutionally contested corporate governance code provision. Design/methodology/approach: The corporate governance code provision of interest in this research recommends that German firms listed on German stock exchanges should disclose the individual remuneration arrangements for their board members. This paper uses 945 firm year observations from 2002 to 2006, the time period during which the adoption of this provision was voluntary for firms, to examine the role of firms' social structural context in the legitimization process of this provision. Findings: The results show that sent board interlocks to firms that defy pressures to adopt this practice have an equally pronounced but opposing effect on its institutionalization process. Received interlocks are inconsequential in this process. The results also provide evidence for the existence of competing influences emanating from firms' industry peers. In contrast to the effects associated with sent board interlocks, at the industry level, peer acquiescence has a more pronounced effect than peer defiance. Furthermore, the practice's legitimacy among firms' peers moderates the effects of sent board interlocks. Originality/value: The results of this paper suggest that a balanced approach to studying institutional change in corporate governance needs to acknowledge the co-existence of conflicting signals regarding the spread of new institutional models. The findings suggest that firms' social structural context plays a central role in processes of contested institutional change. Board interlocks and industry peers carry the potential to facilitate institutional change and facilitate institutional continuity and resistance to change. However, not all board interlocks are of equal importance, and industry peers constitute a source of legitimacy to which directors forming the interlocks attend.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between Board of Director characteristics and CEO compensation. This is semi-empirical study and statistical sample of research was based on 95 companies listed on the Tehran stock exchange from 2010 to 2014. Variables examined include the ratio of non-executive board members, CEO duality, ownership of institutional shareholders and managerial ownership as independent variables. Factors influencing CEO compensation were considered and the relationship between these variables was studied using multivariate regression. The findings indicate that there is a negative relationship between CEO compensation and managerial ownership. There is also a significant positive relationship between CEO compensation and CEO duality. However, there was no evidence for a significant relationship between ratios of non-executive board members and CEO compensation.

There is limited research based on the perspective of neo-institutional that examines the cognitive pressures related to green management practices. The current study examined the relationship between the past environmental related experiences which one of the cognitive dimensions of leader in public listed company and its relationship with positive deviance behaviour in green management practices. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between the past environmental related experiences of the board of directors and positive deviance behaviour in green management practices; however for CEO's past environmental related experiences and its interaction effect with board of director's past environmental experiences are otherwise. This study reveals that the understanding regarding the intersection between sound corporate governance and green management practices is very important in companies deviating positively in green management practices.

This chapter examines the role of governance as a determining factor of foreign investors' decisions as for investing in Tunisian listed family firms. To achieve this goal, first, two distinct forms of family involvement in firms are studied: family ownership and family management. In addition, this research assesses the role of various indicators of family firm governance on foreign investors' decision to invest in Tunisian listed family firms: board of directors' independence, the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder and CEO duality. A sample of 27 firms listed in the Tunis stock exchange from 2007 to 2014 has been used. It is found, on the one hand, that foreign investors seem to avoid investing in firms with high family ownership as well as in those where the family is involved in management; on the other hand, the board of directors' characteristics as well as the presence of a second major nonfamily shareholder do not affect the decisions of foreign investors in Tunisia.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

The Livedoor-Fuji TV takeover battle for Nippon Broadcasting Systems is considered one of the greatest uproars in the corporate takeover in the history of Japan. The epic battle is believed to have its lasting impact on the basic institutions that govern the country's takeover market. The paper aims to investigate the institutional changes, if any, Japan has experienced following the Livedoor episode. Analysing a handful number of takeover attempts before and after the battle, the paper finds that although some surface changes can be observed, a broad-based change is yet to be seen. This can be attributed to the informal institutions which have long been recognised as fundamental building blocks of the national model of corporate governance in Japan.

A key issue when assessing a board of directors' composition is defining the profile of directors' desirable competences. This study follows competence theory to analyze the role of individual competences of board directors. We aim to answer the following questions: which are the required competences of board directors in non-listed companies, and what characteristics might lead to poor individual performance and adversely affect a board's overall performance. To investigate these questions, a grounded theory-based study was conducted involving interviews with twelve board directors who had at least five years of experience as directors and extensive careers as top management executives. Results of the study led to a theoretical model which identifies a set of behavioral competences that add to previous studies on this subject. (c) RAE.

In this paper we integrate the literature on decision quality with considerations specific to boards of directors. In order to maximize the value of their decisions, boards of directors must look beyond their legal obligations and incorporate business ethics and the latest developments in social, scientific and managerial learning on governance and decision-making processes. Organizations will benefit from identifying an internal staff member who can fill the role of Decision Quality Officer ("DQO") to advise the board on decision quality on an ongoing basis. We summarize some of the factors affecting board decisions, and explain the benefit of designating a DQO. Finally, we propose topics for a board policy on the role of a DQO.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We show evidence that female board representation is associated with greater innovative success, and thus enhances firm performance in innovation-intensive industries. Firms with female directors tend to invest more in innovation and obtain more patents and citations for given R&D expenditures. An increase of 10 percentage points in the tenure-weighted fraction of female directors is associated with approximately 6% more patents and 7% more citations. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, the positive association between female board representation and corporate innovation is stronger when product market competition is lower and when managers are more entrenched, consistent with increased monitoring by female directors improving managers' incentives to innovate. Furthermore, we find that female board representation is positively associated with performance only for firms for which innovation and creativity play a particularly important role.

Do women board directors change how companies do business? Firms face growing pressure to appoint more women to their boards of directors, yet little is known about the factors that enable female directors to impact their organizations. This study analyzes the representational thresholds that facilitate women's leadership in the area of corporate social responsibility. We test the predictions of token theory and critical mass theory to evaluate the ability of women to impact firm outcomes based on their numerical representation on the board of directors. Our analysis focuses on board composition and organizational outcomes in the Fortune 500 from 2001 to 2010. Our findings challenge the theoretical assumptions that solo and token women are unable to exert significant influence over their organizations, and underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Firms' boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Despite the growing interest in leaders' role in the turnaround process, there is a paucity of research on founder-CEOs' role in achieving successful turnaround among declining firms. In this study, using insights from the organizational identification literature, we argue that founder-CEOs play an important role in turnaround attempts due to their strong organizational commitment and psychological attachment to the declining firm as well as the relative absence of agency problem issues common among their non-founder counterparts. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from a matched pair sample of 142 US firms that experienced performance decline, we found that founder-CEO leadership significantly increases turnaround success in declining firms. We also found that, among turnaround firms, those led by founder-CEOs tend to put more emphasis on market-based turnaround strategies, such as new product introductions, and less emphasis on retrenchment actions, such as divestments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings contribute to corporate turnaround research by providing a more nuanced view of leaders' role in the turnaround process by specifically exploring the effect of founder CEO leadership. Furthermore, this study contributes to the turnaround literature by highlighting the strategic choices of founder-CEO-led firms and how these choices influence successful turnaround. Finally, by introducing organizational identification perspective, this study provides additional theoretical explanation of leadership antecedents of successful turnarounds. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings of this study suggest that boards of directors, shareholders, and consultants who often participate in turnaround management should carefully consider retaining founder-CEOs and endorsing their leadership during the turnaround process. Further, the findings provide turnaround specialists and other stakeholders with further understanding of not only the importance of product market strategies in the turnaround process but also founder-CEOs' role in fostering such strategies.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

While prior board of director studies have considered the role of director occupational expertise in areas such as law and finance on the strategic actions of the firm, little consideration has been given to understanding the value that human resource expertise on boards of directors, or board HR expertise, can provide. Drawing upon agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates the relationship between board HR expertise and the extent to which firms engage in diversity management. Furthermore, the moderating role of two organizational context factors--capital intensity and firm age--are considered, as these can highlight the degree to which firms strategically depend upon human capital. With a sample of 423 U.S. firms listed on the S&P 500 from 2002 to 2006, the findings indicate that firms with board HR expertise have stronger diversity management in comparison to firms lacking board HR expertise. Moreover, the positive effects of board HR expertise on diversity management decreases when firms' capital intensity or age rises. This highlights the value that HR practitioners can provide in serving on boards of directors, and suggests that the magnitude of board HR experts' influence hinges upon the firm's level of strategic dependence on human capital.

Upper echelons (UE) theory posits that organisational performance reflects the personal values and cognitive frames of the top management team (TMT) and, crucially, that greater heterogeneity in individual backgrounds of senior executives leads to better outcomes. However, often missing from this research is a more developed account of how this relationship between the characteristics of TMTs and performance is also mediated by internal conditions within organisations. In this paper we begin to address this deficiency focusing on the mediating impact of employee satisfaction and the styles and practices of line managers. Looking at the empirical case of English National Health Services acute care hospital trusts, we use a multiple mediation model to analyse the relationship between board heterogeneity, performance and these two (internal) organisational factors. A variance-based structural equation modelling approach (partial least square) is applied to a sample of 102 boards of directors. First, the results lend support to the UE hypothesis that there is a positive impact of board heterogeneity and hos-pital-level performance. Second, the analysis shows that the relationship heterogeneity-performance is positively influenced by: (a) the styles and practices of line managers; (b) the levels of staff satisfaction; and by their mutually reinforcing roles.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While prior research demonstrates the strategic human resource (HR) advantages associated with offering work-family benefits (WFBs), firms continue to be reluctant in providing their employees with these benefits. Drawing on the corporate governance and stakeholder orientation literatures, this study examines the role of board independence and capital for WFBs being offered in publicly-traded firms. Our results demonstrate that various director independence and capital attributes are related to the firm offering WFBs. Specifically, board directors who are outsiders, women, and holders of additional directorships, with their broad stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of WFBs being offered by the firm [Correction added on December 14, 2017, after first online publication: the preceding sentence has been updated to clarify the findings of the study.]. These findings are of importance to HR practitioners considering the influence that corporate boards can have on the firm's use of HR practices, such as WFBs, that affect all employees, not just the executives.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Gender diversity in family firms is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars across several fields. Despite this, there are few literature reviews that synthesize these research streams in the context of family businesses. To fill this gap, we examined the literature on gender diversity on the boards of family businesses by providing some insights into how the typical traits of family firms' boards interact with the diversity effects linked to the presence of women.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

The aim of the present work is to examine corporate directors' boardroom interactions associated with conflicts as well as creativity and innovation phenomena. In line with the behavioral perspective in research on boards, we investigate relationships between task conflicts, an emerging creative and innovative boardroom climate as well as directors' work behaviors. Drawing upon the survey data from 423 corporate directors, we tested hypothesized relationships by the means of the structural equation modelling technique. The results provide evidence suggesting that task-related conflicts among corporate directors appear to be equally detrimental for the psychological workgroup climate as they are advantageous for initiating creative and innovative work behaviours. In other words, the positive effect of task conflicts on directors' creative and innovative work behaviours occurs so long as such conflicts do not simultaneously impair their perception of the creative/innovative boardroom environment. By integrating the literature on workplace group conflicts, creativity and innovation with the corporate governance writings, this study offers a new insight into corporate directors functioning. Presented findings have clear implications for future board research and managerial practice. (c) 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The present research has been undertaken to study the role of ownership type and board mechanisms in moderating the executive pay-corporate performance linkage in the Indian context. A sample of 209 companies listed on the S&P BSE 500 Index has been studied over the period 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Rigorous statistical analysis of the panel data highlights that some of the governance mechanisms are, in practice, instrumental in improving the relationship between pay and performance. Whereas efforts must, indeed, be channelled towards the better functioning of certain other internal control mechanisms. Specifically, of noteworthy consequence is the difference in the way the shareholders and the board of directors ameliorate the pay-performance relationship with respect to accounting vis-a-vis market-based corporate performance. Further, the weak monitoring role discharged by the institutional investors warrant immediate policy concern. The study brings forth important implications for practitioners and policy makers in designing corporate performance-based pay keeping in view the predominant influence exerted by the institutional environment of the emerging economy of India.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine operational and stock performance changes around forced CEO turnovers caused by conflicts between corporate boards and CEOs over the strategic direction of the firm. In addition, the authors investigate whether changes in performance can be explained by board, CEO, or firm characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply propensity score matching to choose matching firms that do not forced CEO turnover but have similar characteristics with the sample firms. The authors compare their operating and stock performances. The authors apply both univariate analysis and multivariate regression analyses. Findings: The authors find that the CEO turnovers caused by conflicts between corporate boards and CEOs over the strategic direction of the firms tend to be preceded by significant declines in a firm's operating and stock performance and that corporate performance improves after turnovers. In addition, the authors find that an increase in long-term incentives and firm size and a decrease in turnover improve firm performance. Originality/value: While the existing corporate governance literature emphasizes oversight as the main role of the board of directors and identifies the CEO as the leader who sets the strategic direction of the firm, in cases of conflict-induced forced CEO turnover, it is the board that sets the strategic direction. This paper is the first to provide evidence regarding the implications of conflict-induced forced CEO turnovers. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study investigates the cross-sectional variation in debt restructuring among Malaysian publicly listed Government Linked companies (GLCs) and non-GLCs (NGLCs) for the period of from 2005 to 2015. It attempts to test several firm determinants that can influence the likelihood of Malaysian GLCs to exercise debt restructuring. Past studies argue that liquidity and profitability influences firm's choice to exercise debt restructuring. This study proposes variants of board of characteristics as one of the influential factors in GLCs debt restructuring since board of directors for this type of organization are usually controlled or owned by government. We employ imbalanced panel data with logistic regression as the method of analysis. The findings show that liquidity, profitability and board characteristics have significant relationship with debt restructuring. The results for profitability indicates that firm with low profitability has higher chance for debt restructuring exercise. However, liquidity has recorded an opposite relationship in our sample. This may be due to our liquidity measures the focuses on short term assets which is less appropriate in debt restructuring context. With regards to board characteristics, three variables such as board size, fraction of Malay directors and fraction of directors with Master degrees show negative and significant relationship influence on the debt restructuring.

The paper analyzes the pervasiveness of family board memberships within family business groups (FBGs), which are large and diversified form of family businesses dominant in emerging economies. The data pertain to 2017 and include board information on 640 firms affiliated to the largest 26 FBGs in Turkey. The study cluster analyzes the FBGs according to family involvement in their governance. Derived from different theoretical lenses, it also aims to identify the variables that condition different clusters. Results show that several decades after liberalization, families still control the groups pervasively though with varying degrees. Regarding the extent of family involvement in governance, different clusters are identified as tight control, vertical control, and loose control. Ownership structure emerges as the main antecedent that differentiates FBGs in different clusters. (c) 2018 Universidad de Malaga. All Rights Reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw from regulatory focus theory, to examine the effects of the "gain/no gain" nature of stock options and retirement pay on the decision to engage in cross-border acquisitions. The moderating effects of managerial discretion arising from the external industry context and internal organizational leadership structure are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ random effects negative binomial regression analysis with a longitudinal (2006-2016) data set of US public companies operating in four industries with differing levels of industry discretion: the oil and gas, paper and packaging, aerospace and defense, and telecommunications. Findings: The findings indicate that both CEO in-the-money stock options and retirement pay are positively related to cross-border acquisition activity. The results also demonstrate that managerial discretion, arising from the firm's external industry context, accentuates the positive relationship between both the value of CEO in-the-money stock options and retirement pay with cross-border acquisition activity. Practical implications: The findings provide implication for practice as understanding how retirement pay and stock options, both of which make up a substantial portion of overall CEO pay in the USA, motivate cross-border acquisition activity, may improve decisions by executives. The evidence also provides guidance to boards of directors who are charged with the responsibility of creating CEO compensation contracts. Originality/value: The paper fills important gaps in the existing research on the influence of compensation elements on firm outcomes, by offering a novel explanation for how in-the-money stock options and retirement pay affect CEOs' motivations to engage in cross-border acquisitions.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: Boards of directors of large companies all over the world frequently have a certain number of shared directors, which can be motivated by social structures that foster different types of links, including investments and vertical relationships. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects that board interlocking exerts on innovation, considering the different nature of shared directors that finally determines the type of links dominating the boards. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses were conducted using data collected from 69 Spanish listed innovative sector companies during the period 2010-2014, which provided an unbalanced panel of 325 data observations. Findings: The results suggested that the typology of interlocks determined their effects on innovation, which had a positive influence when independent and extra-industry directors held multiple directorships, whereas it was negative in the case of intra-industry and women interlocking directors. Practical implications: This study provided evidence for the diverse effects of interlocking directorates and contributed to the open debate on the best board composition for improving business innovation, considering the common feature of shared directorships. Originality/value: The value of this research was twofold. On the one hand, the study considered a wide typology of interlocking directorates, such as women, affiliated and independent directors, intra- and extra-industry directorships, as well as shared directors from the same country. On the other hand, the effects of these different interlocking directorate typologies were analysed on innovation by considering different innovation indicators. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

This article examines how the impact of Information technology (IT) governance by the board of directors on firms' financial performance can be mediated through IT operating capabilities, and how such board IT governance (B-ITG) can modulate the influence of IT operating capability on financial performance. Findings based on a survey of 89 corporate directors indicate that both B-ITG and IT operating capability increase financial performance. They further point to complex B-ITG effects on financial performance, including complementarity with and shaping IT operating capability. They show that high B-ITG suppresses the effect of IT operating capability on financial performance and that B-ITG effects on financial performance are partially mediated through IT operating capability.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the behavioral agency model (BAM) by focusing on the moderating role of CEO gender on the relationship between CEO stock options and risk "systematic vs idiosyncratic" and the performance consequences "positive vs negative" of these option incentives. Design/methodology/approach: Data on CEO's stock option portfolios are collected from the Standard & Poor's (S&P's) ExecuComp. This paper uses a panel data analysis for matched samples of CEOs in S&P's 1,500 listed firms over the period 2006-2013. Findings: The results indicate a more conservative, risk-averse posture in the case of female CEOs than for male CEOs when they are compensated with stock options for idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. The results also confirm that female CEOs in low systematic risk contexts, although more conservative, take more prudent risks that produce better long-term outcomes as compared to their male counterparts. Practical implications: Important implications for the design of optimal CEO's compensation packages emanate from this study. Findings provide useful tools for board of directors to design CEO's pay packages that take into account the different risk behavior of male and female CEOs with the aim of enhancing firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence within the area of stock option-based compensation by focusing on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk when the effect of CEO stock option is analyzed and performance implications of awarding options to male and female CEOs.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to refute the work of Andersen (2017) by suggesting a different theoretical view and to argue that the concept of managerial discretion is one of the core dimensions that cannot be discarded when studying corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses theoretical frameworks from recent literature, definitions and empirical studies on the concept of managerial discretion and corporate governance. Findings: Several studies have empirically tested and measured the concept of managerial discretion, some have provided validity and reliability of the concept and others have showed the direct impact of discretion on firm performance. Practical implications: Research on managerial discretion provides owners and board of directors a clear advice on how much discretion can be granted to top executives by taking into consideration the different dimensions of the external and internal environment. Originality/value: This paper concludes that corporate governance research will not improve if it abandons the concept of managerial discretion. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the contribution of knowing in practice (KP) to the development of dynamic capabilities (DC) in the context of health-care organizations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a case study in a Brazilian hospital in three stages using the data collection techniques of interviews, focus groups, shadowing and conjoint analysis. The participants were health-care employees, supervisors, project managers and members of the board of directors. Findings: This paper identifies the contribution of KP to develop DC based on strategic practices and their respective microprocesses as key elements to DC microfoundations. In the end, the paper points out a mutual contribution between the theoretical approaches. Research limitations/implications: This proposal makes sense in organizations where the practices have a strategic nature, such as hospitals and service providers. Practical implications: This study suggests an alignment between strategic and operational views, stimulating learning across organizational levels. Originality/value: KP helps to give DC a tangible form by including a human dimension into microfoundations, giving voice to practitioners in the strategic decisions. The integration of KP and DC approaches allows organizations to perceive DC in daily practices making DC present in every organizational level, stimulating a continuous organizational learning process.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Drawing on an institutional theoretical perspective, we investigate the impact of the origins of organizational legitimacy on systematic risk using a sample of 358 Brazilian companies between the years 2002 and 2007. We regard three origins of legitimacy--formal-regulatory (presence in premium listings), cultural-cognitive (board of directors), and normative legitimacy (reputation)--to empirically investigate how a company's size and adherence to premium lists moderate other sources of legitimacy. Our results indicate that only under apparently better quality corporate governance conditions--presence in premium listings--do corporate reputation and the board of directors reduce systematic risk. In addition, we show that the effect of reputation on risk is positively moderated by firm size. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC.

Purpose: Some scholars have claimed that CEOs make decisions, while boards of directors control these decisions by applying the concepts of decision management and decision control. These concepts were suggested more than 30 years ago and are still applied in corporate governance research. They are now challenged on the basis of scholarship on corporate governance and management. Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance addresses the authority and responsibility that boards of directors and executives have. Management theory addresses planning and control in corporations. Findings: The relationship between the owners (the boards of directors) and the top managers is hierarchical. This paper concludes that owners or boards of directors make decisions on main and strategic goals. Decisions cannot be controlled, but the implementation and outcomes of plans can. The latter is managers' responsibility. The terms "decision management" and "decision control" are undefined and do not describe what takes place in organizations. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not contain any new empirical data. Originality/value: Management theory offers clear definitions of decisions, decision-making and control. The concepts of decision management (initiation and implementation) and decision control (ratification and monitoring) neither properly describe who makes major and strategic decisions nor how and who controls the consequences of these decisions.

In order to ensure profitability for shareholders, optimal contracting recommends the alignment between executive compensation and company performance. Large organizations have therefore adopted executives remuneration systems in order to induce positive market reaction and motivate executives. Complex compensation schemes are designed by Boards of Directors using strong pay-performance incentives that explain high levels of executive pay along with company size, demand for management skills and executive influence. However, the literature remains inconclusive on the pay-performance relationship owing to the various empirical methods used by researchers. Additionally, there has been little effort in the literature to compare methodologies on the pay-performance relationship. Using the dominant agency theory framework, the purpose of this study is to establish and examine the relationship between firm performance and executive pay. In addition, it intends to assess the characteristic of model specifications commonly adopted. To this aim, a quantitative analysis consisting of three complementary methods was performed on panel data from South African listed companies. The results of the main unrestricted first difference model indicate a strong non-linear relationship where the impact of current and previous firm performance on executive pay can be observed over 2 to 4-year period providing support to the optimal contracting theoretical perspective in the South African business context. In addition, CEO pay is more sensitive to firm performance as compared to Director pay. Lastly, although it affects executive pay levels, company size is not found to improve the pay-performance relationship. (c) 2019 The author(s). This publication is an open access article.

We examine the relation between reserve management and a set of audit committee characteristics of property-liability insurers, using reserve errors as a proxy for reserve management. We find that insurers with three audit committee characteristics have more conservative loss reserve estimations: larger audit committee size and more members with accounting expertise, and more audit committee meetings. Our results also find that three recommendations of the 1999 Blue Ribbon Committee can make corporate audit committees more effective: a minimum audit committee size, a minimum level of accounting expertise, and a minimum number of audit committee meetings. These results were obtained when we controlled for board of director characteristics, firm-specific characteristics, and Sarbanes-Oxley. Some board composition variables (e.g., director ownership) also have an impact on reserve management during our study period. The evidence overall suggests that the audit committee and some board characteristics have an impact on reserve management (earnings management) even in a regulated environment such as the insurance industry.

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The central hypothesis of the managerial power approach (MPA) states that power is the main driver of executive compensation. The positive impact of power on compensation is allegedly demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies. We argue that the hypothesis of a positive impact of power on pay is not falsifiable empirically. The MPA is thus not testable. Empirical studies in this vein can only be interpreted as validation procedures for the empirical power measures employed. We suggest a new theoretical framework for research on the power-compensation relationship. This framework can be used to identify valid power measures empirically. The arguments presented in our paper allow for a reassessment of the role of power in the corporate governance debate. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

This paper investigates whether firms with strong corporate governance perceive non-audit services (NAS) as a threat to auditor independence or as a mechanism to improve audit quality. The sample consisted of 706 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia in 2014 and employed six proxies for corporate governance. The findings show that firms with a bigger audit committee and a higher proportion of independent members in the audit committee are linked with higher NAS, consistent with the resource-based view. The study also found that audit firms in the Big 4 were paid a higher amount of NAS compared to non-Big 4 firms., in line with the general view that the Big 4 auditors supply higher quality services than the non-Big 4. However, it was also found that a more independent board of directors is associated with a low NAS. This suggests that although the board of directors might perceive NAS a threat to auditor independence, a strong audit committee subscribes to the argument that the benefits outweigh the costs. This study contributes to the present literature on the determinants of NAS in an emerging market and would be informative to regulators worldwide when considering new policies related to NAS.

Boards and their directors, a central aspect of the firm's leadership team, find themselves needing to be more accountable than they have ever been before. Accordingly, this chapter considers the corporate board and its ability to create value and to refocus the processes and outcomes of how it is held accountable. Initially, I start by looking at how stakeholder and shareholder views are largely complementary theoretical assumptions, both reflecting a social paradigm associated with the proper roles and responsibilities of firms. I then show how shareholder- and stakeholder-based views can be used to direct boards toward activities that reinforce one another by first outlining two main commonalities of both perspectives - accountability and value - and then illustrating how a board's accountability to both shareholders or stakeholders can lead to value being created in the long term for the other. Lastly, I show how organizational values shape perceptions of how value is created. (c) Joanne B. Ciulla and Tobey K. Scharding 2019.

Corporate governance remains a privileged field for researchers in management sciences. The interest in looking at the governance bodies is that they are supposed to play a very important role in driving the business towards the goals set efficiency and effectiveness. Determining the composition and the ideal functioning of these governance bodies is an ultimate goal for researchers and practitioners, but the road is still long because the conclusions of the studies made up to this day on the subject do not unanimously. One of the topics (and little discussed) about the effect of gender diversity on the effectiveness of the board of directors.The purpose of this article is to present a contribution in the analysis of the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors on the financial performance of Moroccan banks. After a presentation of the mission of the board of directors and its objectives, we presented the main theories, which evoked our problematic, then to present a synthesis of the works, which studied the impact of the presence of the women on the performance of the banks and finally an empirical analysis of this relationship. This analysis is made from the data of six Moroccan banks over a period of 10 years. The results showed that there is only one positive and significant relationship between the presence of women and the financial performance expressed by ROE and ROA.

The study aims to determine how different factors shape the size of boards of directors in private firms conducting an initial public offering (IPO) on the regulated Euronext Paris market. These factors include the presence of a venture capitalist, ownership structure, firm-specific characteristics and CEO characteristics. To study the determinants of board size, we used a sample of 568 firms that went public from 1995 to 2012 and found that the boards tend to become more independent shortly after going public, which indicates that firms are affected by monitoring in financial markets. The study found strong evidence that ownership variables, board structure variables, CEO characteristic variables and firm characteristic variables tend to affect board size. Our results also indicate that venture capitalists are a major catalyst for IPOs because they provide financing and strategic advice, act as an opposing force to the CEO and shape the governance structure.

This paper examines how the ownership structure and board of directors' features determine the managerial opportunistic behavior exemplified in the management of accounting earnings. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship of firm-level and country-level corporate governance systems on the earnings management in the Spanish corporate sector. Results reveal that the varying efficiency of the corporate governance systems is reflected in the way in which accounting discretion is performed. We found evidence that earnings management is reduced as the voting rights of the controlling shareholder increased and that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between insiders' ownership and the earnings manipulation. Regarding the board characteristics, we observe that larger, independent boards, those with a larger proportion of female members, and those with an audit committee compounded by a greater proportion of outside independent directors oversee managers more efficiently, constraining their capacity to manage earnings. To the contrary, board duality increases the likelihood of opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting. We found that when the institutional environment improves in the Spanish context, the discretionary power of the corporate sector to overstate the financial statements is reduced. The findings prove the necessity of reinforcing the rules and regulations toward a more transparent disclosure of the financial statements. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of corporate board and audit committee characteristics and ownership structures on market-based financial performance of listed firms in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: It applies system GMM (generalized method of moments) as the baseline estimator approach, and ordinary least squares and fixed effects for robustness checks on a sample of 452 firms listed on the Thai Stock Exchange for the period 2000-2016. Findings: Relying mainly on the system GMM estimator, the empirical results indicate some emerging trends in the Thai economy. Contrary to expectations for an emerging market and prior research findings, ownership structures, particularly ownership concentration and family ownership, appear to have no significant influence on market-based firm performance, while managerial ownership exerts a positive effect on performance. Moreover, as expected, board structure variables such as board independence; size; meeting and dual role; and audit committee meeting show significant explanatory power on market-based firm performance in Thai firms. Practical implications: These findings are important for policymakers in constructing an appropriate set of governance mechanisms in an emerging market context, and for corporate entities and investors in shaping their understanding of corporate governance in the Thai institutional context. Originality/value: Unlike previous literature on the Thai market, this study is the first to use the more advanced econometric method known as system GMM estimator for addressing causality/endogeneity issues in governance-performance relationships. The findings indicate new trends in the explanatory power of ownership structure variables on market-based firm performance in Thai-listed firms. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2020 Academy of Management Review.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study builds on implementation intention theory to indicate that both business and family governance practices influence the succession planning process in family firms. In addition, this study draws on goal adjustment theory to explore whether the family CEO's emotions, being his or her inability to let go of the family firm, hamper the governance decisions of the board of directors concerning that succession planning process. Applying a moderated mediation analysis on a sample of 225 family firms, results show that board involvement in the succession process mediates the positive relationship between the use of family governance practices and the level of succession planning. In addition, the family CEO's inability to let go negatively moderates this mediating relationship which signifies that emotions influence governance outcomes in family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Given that ideological differences are likely to become an increasing source of conflict within organizations, we introduce ideological diversity as a new board-level diversity construct and hypothesize its effects on CSR performance. We hypothesize that ideological diversity can have a negative effect on CSR performance through social categorization mechanisms. Alternatively, we introduce a competing hypothesis that suggests a positive effect of ideological diversity on CSR performance through information processing mechanisms. We test our hypotheses on a panel of 372 Dutch municipality boards from 2014 to 2017 using a fixed effects OLS regression. These methods allow us to control for unobserved heterogeneity and is supported by the Hausman test we perform. Results support a negative relationship between board ideological diversity and CSR performance, indicating that a high level of ideological diversity leads to a lower performance in CSR. We discuss the implications of these findings for the board diversity and CSR literatures. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Research Question/Issue: The role of the board chair has become increasingly complex in recent decades. Research on corporate governance has called for and has initiated the pursuit of more research for the purpose of creating a better understanding of the role of board chairs. We reviewed 234 academic articles published in 66 journals, structured the existing research according to an Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework, and provided a future research agenda for studies on the role of the board chair. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals that the number of published studies on the position of the board chair has grown over the last two decades. Although extant research is dominated by quantitative studies exploring the impact of the board chair position on financial performance, frequently drawing on agency and stewardship theory, recent work has moved beyond this focus and has added valuable insights. The Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework used to structure the extant research reveals that future research should pursue topics related to all components of the framework and that opportunities exist to draw from a broader set of theories. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the framework, we formulate seven specific research topics that can add valuable insights into the role of the board chair and suggest theories that can help inform research pursuing these topics. Taken together, these topics have the potential to create valuable insights into how board chairs are appointed, develop competencies, and interact and work with the CEO, the top management team, the board, and other stakeholders while acknowledging the influence of contextual factors, such as ownership, diversity, the firm's development stage, and external events and trends. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review shows a growing global movement toward prescribing more corporate governance regulations and separating the positions of the board chair and the CEO. We show that many aspects need to be considered when choosing a governance configuration and when appointing a board chair because this role is becoming increasingly demanding.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

To better understand how executives impact resource allocation, we investigate the three underpinnings of dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs) as antecedents of related business diversification (RBD) and how they interact with firm resources to influence RBD. Taking football as the research subject, we analyze the joint impact of managerial human capital, managerial social capital, and managerial cognition within the board of directors of English Premier League clubs. We rely on a unique 15-year panel dataset and show that more specific managerial human capital and a long-term orientation among the board of directors increase RBD while additional general managerial human capital and managerial social capital diminish RBD. In addition, our findings reveal that DMCs moderate the relationships of physical and financial resources with RBD in different directions. Our study is amongst the first to analyze all three underpinnings of DMCs and to endorse the practical relevance of DMCs for RBD. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Human capital has been traditionally viewed in terms of how an individual's investment in knowledge, skills and abilities can lead to higher pay or promotions. More recently, human capital has been regarded as a unit-level resource using the term "human capital resources" to consider the aggregate effects of human capital. The purpose of this paper is to examine the collective human capital present in a firm's board of directors as a valuable resource leading to superior firm outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined the effects on firm innovation of the scientific expertise of corporate directors, average board tenure and the presence of a firm's founder on the board. Data from a sample of pharmaceutical firms were analyzed with the dependent variable, innovation, measured as patent applications and both individual and unit-level human capital measures of the predictor variables. Findings: The results show that the presence of a founder-director is positively related to innovation and more pronounced when combined with the board's scientific expertise. Board tenure shows a relationship to innovation and is more evident in combination with the board's aggregate level of scientific expertise. The effect of directors' scientific expertise is also greater when measured at the board level of scientific expertise. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should examine these relationships within a broader context extending the research to other industries thereby incorporating wider variation in both the antecedents and measures of innovation. In addition, future studies might investigate a likely non-monotonic relationship of board tenure with strategic outcomes, recognizing the non-linear nature of effects of board tenure. Practical implications: In addition to the theoretical and empirical implications, this research may also inform practicing managers charged with constituting their boards of directors and provide some guidance for the recruitment and retention of board members. The research may also assist top managers and investors in knowing when the presence of a founder on the board is useful and supportive of the firm's strategic direction. Originality/value: The study extends scholarly understanding of human capital theory beyond the top management team to boards of directors demonstrating the importance not only of directors' individual capital but also how it combines with that of other directors. Moreover, it enhances understanding of board characteristics beyond the bounds of demographic characteristics to show that additional qualities affect firm strategy. This research also informs managers, boards and investors how boards might be more effectively constituted to impact firm strategy. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

This research aims to examine the effect of board characteristics on the Maqashid Shariah Index (MSI) of the performance of Indonesian Islamic banks, using panel data regression. Independent variables, namely the characteristics of the board of commissioners, board of directors, and Shariah supervisory board, are related to board internal ownership, board expertise, board independence, cross-membership of boards, and board tenure, with size and growth as controlling variables, while the dependent variable is maqashid shariah performance in Islamic banks. The study samples include 12 Islamic banks in Indonesia which regularly published their annual reports and management over the period 2009 to 2017. The results from both models, with and without control variables, show that board ownership (commissioner and director), board cross-membership (commissioner and Shariah supervisor) and Shariah supervisor expertise do not have an impact on the MSI. Moreover, the results from the model without control variables show that commissioner expertise has a positive impact on the MSI, while board tenure (commissioner and director) and commissioner independence have a negative impact on the index. These results provide recommendations for the Islamic banking industry, so that it can be applied optimally to achieve the main objectives of the maqashid Shari'ah.

This study explores contextual and organisational factors that influence the likelihood of adopting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-friendly practices. Drawing on institutional theory, we hypothesise that state laws, state conservativism, and localised LGBT-friendliness density will have a direct effect on the adoption of LGBT-friendly practices. Given the observed variation in the adoption of these practices, we also draw on strategic choice and the upper echelons perspective and hypothesise that the effect of institutional mechanisms is moderated by the beliefs and values of powerful organisational agents (chief executive officers and boards of directors). Our sample consists of 201 U.S.-based Fortune 1000 companies over a period of seven years, and we test our hypotheses using a Cox proportional hazards survival analysis. Our results offer support for the role of state conservativism and localised LGBT-friendliness density in the likelihood of LGBT-friendly practices adoption, as well as for the moderating role of chief executive officer and board of directors' political orientation.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by a board of directors. While prior research has surveyed the impact of performance and governance-related factors on CEO selection decisions, our understanding of the implications of a firm's global context is limited. This article explores the influence of home country globalization, international diversification, and the undertaking of major cross-border acquisitions on the appointment of a CEO with a global mind-set. Using a sample of European and U.S. firms from the Global 500 ranking from 2005 to 2010, we find that companies are likely to match the characteristics of new CEOs with their global strategic contexts. Managerial Summary: In this article, we highlight the interplay between a firm's global context and CEO selection. Our findings indicate that executives aspiring to reach the C-suite should be highly attuned to the imperatives of aligning their knowledge bases, mind-sets, and perspectives to grasp the challenges faced by companies operating within a global context. From the board's perspective, the selection of a new CEO provides the opportunity to assess a firm's future strategic direction and enables the board to select an executive with the managerial capabilities required to address the challenges of globalization.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine various factors affecting the pricing of audit services and the selection of auditors in the Indian audit market. This paper also aims to investigate the impact of financial distress conditions on the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm, particularly in the context of a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 22,644 firm-years for 1,366 Indian firms from 1990 to 2015. The authors adopt ordinary least squares regression technique to model audit fee, and logistic regression technique to model auditor choice as a function of various factors relating to firm attributes and auditor characteristics. Findings: This paper finds that auditors tend to charge an audit fee premium when they are affiliated to a Big 4 auditor, have industry specialization or jointly provide auditing and non-auditing services. Additionally, firms with larger boards, higher proportion of independent board of directors and CEO-Chairman separation are more likely to choose a Big 4-affiliated auditor. The results also suggest that financially distressed firms tend to pay significantly lower audit fees and are more likely to choose non-Big 4 auditors. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies which investigate how financial distress impacts the audit pricing and auditor choice decisions of a firm in the context of emerging economies. The findings of this paper raises serious concerns about the credibility of the audited financial statements and corporate governance mechanisms of firms undergoing financial distress. The empirical results of this paper have strong implications for practitioners, regulators and investors. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and other questionable business incidents that appear to harm stakeholders frequently afflict firms yet draw disparate investor reactions. We address this disparity by investigating the association between firm legal orientation and investor reactions to CSI. We hypothesize the proportion of board members and top management team (TMT) executives with law degrees affects investor perceptions of firm foresight, and in turn, their judgment of blame and consequent punishment. Based on abnormal returns to 629 announcements of CSI and 308 publicly traded S&P 500 firms, we find that both too small and too large a proportion of board of directors and TMT members with law degrees lead investors to mete out harsher punishment. This inverted u-shaped link is further affected by firm size, firm risk, and industry competition. Our investigation sheds light on the link between executive education and financial performance in the context of CSI and investor perceptions of foresight. (c) 2020 W.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance and earnings opacity in China. Design/methodology/approach: Two corporate governance mechanisms form the basis of the analysis: 1) the board of directors and 2) the external audit function. OLS regression analysis is employed on a large sample from 2000 to 2014 with 20,235 firm-year observations. Findings: Corporate governance is found to be associated with reduced levels of earnings opacity for Chinese listed companies. Furthermore, the association between corporate governance and reduced levels of earnings opacity strengthened after the implementation of various key reforms. Practical implications: Chinese regulators are advised to proceed with caution as not all Western approaches to corporate governance are transferrable to the Chinese setting. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by analyzing broad latent constructs of corporate governance in addition to individual observable dimensions in order to reveal that various key reforms have been successful in strengthening the link between governance and reporting quality for Chinese listed companies.

This study investigates the determinants of board of director compensation from the view of strategic management. Specifically, this study examines the association between product market competition and directors' compensation for a sample of 524 listed firms in Malaysia from 2010 to 2014. We find that there is a positive relationship between a competitive firm and its compensation to its directors. Our research indicates that managerial incentives reflect more of talent appreciation, rather than purely for acknowledging better performance or a bigger size firm. This research contests the use of agency theory and managerialism in explaining directors' compensation, especially for the developing country context of Malaysia. Our findings also imply that firms may pay higher compensation in a competitive market. (c) 2019 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

Objectives Nowadays, the study of gender diversity in the business environment is becoming considerably relevant, due to the incorporation of women into the working life. Social advances have enabled women to leave behind their limited roles at home, and their inclusion in the labour market has gone beyond the compliance with ethics and legislation. Family firms have played a key role in the inclusion of women in the workplace, due to, among other reasons, the existence of shared roles and the overlapping of family and business values. However, and surprisingly, there are not many studies investigating the role of women in family firms. In recent years, the academic interest has been focused on gender diversity, namely on the inclusion of women on boards of directors and in top management positions. Specifically, the latest research analyses how gender diversity on boards of directors and in top management positions affects different measures of firm performance, focusing on profitability measurements. However, the obtained results so far are not conclusive at all, revealing that the presence of women on corporate governance bodies can have a positive, a negative or even a non-significant influence on firm performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is shedding some light on this controversial topic, by analysing whether the presence of women in three corporate governance bodies, i.e. the board of directors, the general meeting of shareholders and the top management team, of agri-food family firms influences the firms' economic efficiency. Methods To develop the empirical part of this study, a sample of 147 family firms pertaining to the agri-food industry has been used. The final sample was obtained from a wider study analysing the general characteristics of a representative sample of Spanish family firms. In this regard, the data presented in this article come from two different sources: on the one hand, the financial and economic data were obtained from the SABI (Sistema de Analisis de Balances Ibericos) database of Bureau Van Dijk; on the other hand, the qualitative data were obtained from the database provided by the Spanish Institute of Family Businesses and the Spanish Network of Family Business Chairs, based on a survey conducted in 2016. The proposed hypotheses were checked by performing ordinary least-squares regression analysis. Findings The obtained findings suggest that the presence of women on the boards of directors of Spanish agri-food family firms has a positive and very significant influence on economic efficiency. Moreover, the presence of women at the general meeting of shareholders also has a positive and significant influence on the firms' economic efficiency. However, the presence of women in top management teams does not exert a significant impact on economic efficiency. Contributions The present article offers several contributions to the literature. First, this study is pioneering in considering the role exerted by female directors, shareholders and managers in the economic efficiency of family firms. Although women have exerted a fundamental role within business families, their influence in the firm sphere has been very limited. In this vein, our work answers the call for further research on gender issues in family firms. Second, this study shows that gender diversity on both the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders of Agrifood family firms has a positive impact on business efficiency, revealing that women influence economic and business development. In this sense, not only is the presence of women attributed to an increase in economic efficiency, but also to an increase in social performance. Third, with regard to the agri-food industry, this study makes an important contribution at both the theoretical and the empirical level. Studies related to the agri-food industry are usually experimental studies based on comparisons and evaluations to improve production systems, as well as technical studies to achieve sustainable use of natural resources. However, there are few studies aimed at analysing the management of agri-food family firms, with special attention to the participation of a vulnerable stratum, such as women. As a fourth contribution, we have a sectored study of family firms, which allows to present more precise findings in an important industry for the society and the economy at a global level, which is the agri-food industry. Practical Implications The present work contributes to give visibility to those women present in the corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, since it reveals that female participation favours the economic and financial results of these firms. Although it is true that previous studies have analysed the effect of female presence in cooperative firms, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are not studies addressing this issue in agri-food family firms. Furthermore, from a legal perspective, this work highlights the level of influence that both the Organic Law 3/2007 of March 22nd 2007, for effective equality between women and men (BOE, 2007), and the Law 35/2011 of October 4th 2011, on shared ownership in agricultural holdings (BOE, 2011), have had on the incorporation of women in ownership and management positions in agricultural holdings. Therefore, the obtained findings in this study may be an incentive to promote the restructuring of corporate governance bodies of agri-food family firms, increasing the presence of women in them. Limitations The contributions of this study are no free of limitations, which, in turn, may provide opportunities for future research. First, we have focused on the economic efficiency of agri-food family firms. Thus, the obtained findings may not be applicable to other industries. However, from our point of view, it is of utmost interest to evaluate the role of women in agri-food family firms to the extent that in southern Spain the agri-food industry is especially relevant for the regional economy, as well as because the issue of gender diversity in the business environment is acquiring special interest in recent years. Another limitation of our study is that we have considered the female presence in three corporate governance bodies, even though the participation of women in any other corporate body can be beneficial to firms. A final limitation would be that the analysed family firms are located in Spain and thus, it would be necessary to determine whether different findings are obtained in other countries or regions. Originality The study of gender diversity in the business environment has emerged as a fruitful field of research in recent years, but the current knowledge regarding the influence of women on firms' outcomes is still scarce. This paper contributes to the family business literature, both in terms of corporate governance and in terms of gender, by offering some conclusions regarding the presence of women in different corporate governance bodies. Furthermore, this paper provides new research avenues that will provide a better comprehension for scholars and specialists for future investigations in the field. (c) 2020, CIRIEC.

This article studies the impact of the Board of Directors (BOD) on financial reporting quality (FRQ) in Vietnam listed companies. The research uses FEM, REM and GLS regression models, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010-2018, with 2162 observations. The research results have found that the BOD size, BOD independence, BOD chairperson cum CEO has a positive impact on FRQ while BOD meeting frequency has a negative impact on FRQ. In addition, the audit quality, the ratio of liabilities has a positive impact on FRQ while company size has a negative impact on FRQ. Further, the percentage of female BOD members does not have an impact on FRQ. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to improve FRQ by considering of factors of the board of director in a more effective manner. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

Ethics of governance deficiencies including weak management of the prin-cipal-agent problem by the board of directors and conflict over the strategic intent of the organisation between groups of employees such as the board of directors, top management team, and the middle-line managers working in small teams are age old problems for stock exchange listed companies. These matters continue to cause shareholders of listed companies much concern, creating tense annual general meetings and robust community debate on how to reign in blatant moments of managerial hegemony (or dominance) with agents exploiting principals, at times at great financial cost to long suffering shareholders. The role of the chairperson and the board applying agency theory is to manage these conflicts on behalf of the shareholders; however, in many instances, company directors have failed in their duties and investors have been aggrieved - the result, war in organisations. The challenge for organisations is to avoid this source of tension and war caused by emergence of managerial hegemony over the organisation and to promote sound executive stewardship and effective social exchange among the board, executive team, and middle-line managers. These challenges are discussed and solutions are developed. The importance of strategic intent as a unifying rhetorical message as a key component of an ethics of governance regime that keeps the peace and prevents war in the organisation is explained.

An established succession planning program for the identification and grooming of its next leader helps maintain the continuity of firm strategy and leadership style, which influences long-term firm performance and viability. Disclosure of succession planning information may alleviate investors' doubts about whether the firm has a succession planning plan, while it may increase competition for CEO candidates, leading to increases in the cost of securing qualified candidates. This study explores what determines firms' decisions to provide this disclosure using firms that initiate CEO succession planning disclosure in a given year and their control firms. We find that firms are more likely to initiate the disclosure of CEO succession planning when 1) segment concentration (negatively related to organizational complexity) becomes lower, 2) the board of directors becomes more independent, 3) the CEO has reached the retirement age of 64, 4) the CEO becomes more important relative to other executive officers in the industry labor market, 5) the number of analysts following (reflecting external monitoring) increases, and 6) CEO tenure (reflecting CEO entrenchment) declines. Overall, our findings suggest that the disclosure of CEO succession planning is motivated by investor demand for a smooth transition among top management and enhanced transparency in CEO succession planning.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

The international literature has deepened the importance of analysing the composition of BoDs in order to understand their effectiveness and efficiency. Along this path of research, this chapter aims to investigate the board diversity reviewing the main contributes developed on this topic. Specifically, the chapter illustrates the different sources in terms of diversity in the boardrooms, putting in evidence the role of regulations and institutional investors at promoting the growth of this diversity. The analysis is proposed through a cost-benefit approach, to illustrate the potential advantages and the relative risks connected to the diversity in BoDs. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

The objective of the present study was to determine the differences in the effectiveness of the control of the board of directors for companies that present duality executive director-chairman of the board, and those that do not present this duality. The research is explained through a quantitative approach for which an instrument is used to measure the effectiveness of the control, and is based on four dimensions. The data analysis was done through the test of differences of means using t student. As a result, the duality executive director-chairman of the board influences the performance levels of independent directors and performance evaluation of the executive director.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance. Findings would assist the committee of MCCG2012 and other authorities to reinforce on the corporate governance compliance and good practice. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

Research into boards of directors has provided mixed support for the view that outside directors' independence or leadership by an independent chair improves monitoring. In this study, we use a micro-level approach to provide a better understanding of why outside directors have difficulty in monitoring the CEO. We highlight that an important reason for this lies in the boardroom dynamics associated with (a) outside directors' cognitive conflict with the CEO and (b) the chair's leadership of the board. Our inductive analyses of video observations of board meetings in five Australian corporations revealed the importance of chair participative leadership during disagreement episodes in the boardroom. Follow-up in-depth interviews of board meeting participants highlighted the importance of psychological safety as a key mechanism explaining why participative board chairs appear so effective in dealing with board-CEO cognitive conflict. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study involving data on 310 outside directors from 64 Dutch boards. Whereas prior work has mostly focused on the chair's relationship with the CEO, we instead highlight the importance of the chair's role as the leader of the board and identify board psychological safety as an important element shaping director monitoring within the confines of the boardroom.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Academic research is generally seen as one of the most important goals of a university, but universities are being called upon simultaneously to assist in building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem and contributing to economic growth. Universities can be the source of startups based on academic research results and thereby influence a given industrial context. This paper investigates the impact of academic entrepreneurship on the economic performance of university spin-offs (USOs) and, in particular, how the composition of the founding team, the diversity of academic ownership, CEO duality, and the presence of women on the board of directors affect USO success. We study these relationships with a cross-sectional sample of 136 firms in southern Italy. Our findings highlight that governance and ownership can influence various indicators that are often used for measuring enterprise success in different ways and that, based on the specific success metrics, managers or policymakers should consider different aspects to better understand a USO's potential for success.

Prior research documents that information transmitted via director networks affects firms' policies and real economic activities. Given a manager's potential monopoly over firm information, it is important to analyze whether information transmission through director social networks undermines the manager's control. Specifically, we explore whether information flow through director networks influences managers' ability to hoard bad news. We predict and find that the extent of external connections of the board of directors is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Additional analysis implies that this evidence is driven by firms with more powerful executives, with weaker auditor monitoring, or subject to strong investor protection, and by directors with greater monitoring incentives or responsibilities and directors with less firm-specific knowledge. Collectively, our research lends empirical support for the monitoring view under which better-informed directors narrow the scope for bad news hoarding evident in stock price crash risk. In another series of tests, we fail to find evidence consistent with the information leakage view under which directors pass sensitive firm-specific information to connections that trade on the information before its public release. Other analysis helps dispel the concern that the endogenous match between directors and companies is spuriously responsible for our core results. Our empirical findings have important implications on how social networks affect the proper functioning of capital markets. (c) CAAA

Generating and implementing innovative ideas is a key organizational effort to achieve superior performance and secure competitive advantages. Accordingly, the influence of strategic leaders on organizational innovation is increasingly drawing research attention. In this study, we review and synthesize research on how strategic leaders (chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors) influence innovation and propose a framework to guide future research on this important topic. We explain how existing theories rely on discretional or architectural mechanisms to explain strategic leaders' influence on innovation and review how current studies relate strategic leaders to the specific stages of the innovation process. We also discuss the role of the internal and external environment in moderating these relationships and provide an overview and criticism of theoretical and methodological issues. Overall, we discuss the most relevant findings of the field, analyze how specific suggestions drawn from our framework can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the influence of strategic leaders on innovation, and propose multiple research opportunities.

We theorize that female candidates considering CEO roles will perceive greater termination vulnerability in such roles than their male counterparts. We further theorize that indicators of recent organizational distress will exacerbate female CEO candidates' perceptions of termination vulnerability, while the presence of female leaders will mitigate these concerns. To test our arguments, we examine the initial values of newly appointed female and male CEOs' severance agreements from 2007 to 2014. Results support our arguments and begin to shed light on the factors that influence female executives' concerns about CEO roles and ultimately firms' ability to appoint female CEOs.

Research and development (R&D) is a key contributor to organizations' pursuit of innovation. In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending--the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk-taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages.

This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study documents a positive and robust effect of co-opted boards on firm innovation. This effect is mainly driven by co-opted independent directors. Firms with more co-opted independent directors are associated with lower sensitivities of CEO pay and turnover to performance. It suggests that co-opted boards promote innovation by insulating managers' career concerns from innovation risk and supporting incentive contracts that motivate innovation. Overall, our study provides new evidence on co-opted boards benefiting firm innovation. (c) 2020 The Eastern Finance Association

Drawing on the notion of "faultlines" and the upper echelons perspective, we argue that the gender faultline strength of a board of directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly, while gender faultline strength negatively relates to strategic change under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for the hypotheses. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

The literature investigating corporate governance (CG) disclosure has predominantly stressed the monitoring role of the board of directors, analysing the association between information about the board's independence and firm market performance. Drawing from managerial studies, the governance literature has recently recognized corporate performance is affected by a wider set of directors' personal traits. However, CG reporting does not currently require disclosure of most of these characteristics. We believe knowledge of directors' personal traits is valuable for investors if these characteristics are indicators of company performance. Drawing on a sample of listed Italian family firms, we embrace a wide set of hand-collected information that captures directors' profiles to verify their association with Tobin's Q. Even if such associations are casual, we infer that information about board members' profiles beyond CG report disclosures is useful for market participants. The results from the regression analyses show that information about directors' personal details, educational backgrounds, and work experience in specific professional areas is predictive of market performance, and that the market evaluates board members' personal information that is currently ignored in CG reports. The study offers practical contributions to standard setters, highlighting the need to extend CG reporting requirements for directors' personal profiles. Further, the evidence contributes to drawing the attention of preparers and users to board of directors' profile information that is currently not disclosed in CG reporting.

This study examines the effect of board of directors' expertise and tax avoidance on corporate debt. We find that there is no association between financially expert outside directors on the board and corporate debt, which is contrary to some prior research findings. However, we do find a positive association between the proportion of financially expert inside directors on the board and debt. We also find that the debt substitution effect is significantly intensified by the presence of outside directors on the board with financial expertise, which suggests that the advice offered by these directors better informs managers to make decisions about the trade-off between the benefits and costs of debt and non-debt tax shields. We find no such effect for inside directors. Overall, this study extends the literature on corporate governance, tax avoidance and corporate debt.

This research investigates the relationship between fat cat firms and crash risk. Our empirical results find that under industry fixed effects, fat cat firms are positively associated with stock price crash, demonstrating that a self-interested board of directors leads to a serious agency problem. We find consistent results after we control for other types of fat cat firms, sample selection bias, endogeneity problem and use different measurements of crash risk. Finally, we also report that under the within-firm scenario, the more frequently firms are listed as fat-cat firm announcements, the worse agency problem it encountered, which causes fat cat firms to have higher crash risk.

We apply the psychosocial concept of generativity, or one's outlook toward the next generation, to the context of chief executive officer (CEO) succession. Integrating prior research on generativity and CEO succession, we identify two key orthogonal dimensions of CEO generativity: (a) the CEO's degree of commitment to developing the next generation of company leadership and (b) the CEO's degree of need to control the succession process and outcome. A given CEO's place on these two dimensions constitutes their overall "generativity mindset," which we conceptualize as a relatively stable motivational orientation that stems from the CEO's disposition and accumulated life experiences. From these dimensions, we identify four archetypes: The generative, hypergenerative, hypo-generative, and anti-generative CEO. We then specify how the alternative archetypes affect an array of CEO actions throughout the CEO's tenure, especially the CEO's approach to assessing and developing executives for advancement. These various actions lay the foundation for eventual succession outcomes, particularly the nature of the succession and the origin and preparation of the selected successor. The final part of our model inserts the board of directors as a potentially moderating influence in all the foregoing relationships. We conclude with an overview of follow-on research opportunities.

Purpose: This study aims to discuss the determinants of Islamic banks' efficiency. It tries to explore the source of Islamic banks' inefficiencies to propose solutions to guarantee an acceptable level of technical efficiency of such banks in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this objective, the authors use a parametric approach, especially, the stochastic frontier approach, using production function and panel data analysis. The authors apply a package Frontier 4.1 for the estimation process, which is composed of two principal steps. In the first step, the authors estimate Islamic banks' efficiency scores in different GCC countries based on an output distance function. In the second step, the analysis highlights the impact of managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance, scarcity of Shari'ah scholars, the board independence and chief executive officers' (CEOs) duality on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Findings: This study's results document that managerial-specific education on Islamic accounting and finance and the board of directors' composition, especially, the board's independence, can largely explain the technical efficiency scores of Islamic banks in GCC countries. Especially, the authors find evidence that managerial-specific education is negatively associated with the inefficiency term. The coefficient of the Shari'ah scholar's variable has a positive sign indicating that the more there are Shari'ah experts, the more the bank is efficient. In addition, CEOs' duality seems to have no significant effect on GCC Islamic banks' efficiency. Practical implications: GCC Islamic banks need to improve the presence of independent members on the board of directors. In addition, these banks are invited to count more on Shari'ah auditors and educated staff characterized by a high level of competency in the domain of Islamic banking and finance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that highlights the effect of managerial-specific education in Islamic accounting and finance and scarcity of Shari'ah scholars on Islamic banks' efficiency.

Research Summary: Director retention is a common practice during acquisitions, whereby the acquiring firm adds at least one director from the target onto its board. Despite the regularity of the phenomenon, little is understood about the post-acquisition financial implications of director retention. In this exploratory study, we investigate the financial impact (via long-term investor value appropriation) of director retention in a sample of acquisitions among publicly traded firms. Our empirical analyses consistently illustrate negative financial ramifications of director retention for the acquiring firm across multiple analytic models, time horizons of performance, and samples. We delineate implications for research on boards of directors and acquisitions, and we offer preliminary theoretical logic and empirical analyses for future scholarship to elucidate the mechanisms driving antecedents and outcomes of director retention. Managerial Summary: Despite the prevalence of director retention--a practice where an acquirer adds at least one director from the target onto the board of the ongoing firm--research on the topic is equivocal about the financial implications of this practice. We argue this is a crucial oversight because new directors can have an incredible influence on the trajectory of the firm and its subsequent performance, a fact that is particularly true in the turbulent post-acquisition period. In our study, we empirically examine the impact of director retention on post-acquisition performance. Across multiple analyses and time intervals of performance, we consistently find that director retention is negatively associated with the performance of the acquiring firm. Accordingly, our findings suggest that acquirers should generally approach direction retention with caution. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

This study investigates how company secretaries (CS) influence board practices and financial reporting. All public companies have a secretary and this position may be combined with Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or legal counsel. Examining the period 2004-2015, we find that joint CS/CFOs hold more audit committee meetings, are associated with less earnings management and a greater likelihood of a clean audit opinion. Companies with joint CS/legal counsels are more timely filers and company secretaries of multiple companies schedule fewer committee meetings. These results indicate that company secretaries significantly influence board practices and financial reporting, depending on their role and busyness.

Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the top management team (TMT) structural power framework, we investigate the relationship between Chief Information Officer (CIO) structural power and forward-looking firm performance. In addition, we examine the contingency roles of market turbulence, industry IT intensity, and operating efficiency in shaping the above relationship. Using a sample of 7,185 firm-year observations and a panel fixed-effects model, we find that CIO structural power is positively associated with forward-looking firm performance (proxied by Tobin's q). Further, our results suggest that the benefits of CIO structural power are higher under greater market turbulence, higher industry IT intensity, and greater operating efficiency. Our empirical results imply that the board of directors should consider endowing CIOs with a higher structural power, especially when an organization faces greater volatility in industry sales, competes in a more IT-intensive industry, and operates at a more efficient level. This research contributes to the RBV literature and integrates RBV and structural power frameworks to offer newer insights into the contemporary role of an important TMT member, the CIO.

This paper aims to examine how chief executive officer (CEO) dominance is associated with a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement, and whether the board gender diversity moderates this relationship. We use a two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze this relationship in a sample of 700 firm-year observations from FTSE 100 listed companies covering the period from 2008 to 2017. This study shows that CEO dominance is negatively associated with CSR engagement, and that the board gender diversity is positively moderated this relationship. Our study finds evidence supporting both the critical mass theory and the upper echelons theory, and suggests that a high proportion of female in the board of directors may reduce the CEO dominance, as a key player in the top management team, and increase the CSR engagement. These results are robust to alternative econometric specifications and variable definitions. This study differs from previous studies in that we introduce the board gender diversity as a moderator of the relationship between CEO dominance and CSR engagement in the UK context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of CEO compensation for sample of the US firms. It emphasizes the presence of executive compensation persistence and the importance of CEO power besides performance while setting CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of US firms during the period 2006-2016. It is based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) models to assess the impact of numerous factors on CEO compensation. Findings: The main findings reveal that firm performance proxied by accounting-based proxies, as well as market-based proxies, plays a significant role in explaining variations in levels of executive compensation. Moreover, there is a significant persistence in executive compensation among the US sample firms. The authors also document that poor governance conditions (managerial power hypothesis) lead to high compensation levels offered to CEO. Research limitations/implications: At the end, without a doubt, the analysis has some limitations that prompt the authors to consider future research directions. One future research avenue that can help better explain the effect of firm performance on the CEO compensation is to study this issue using an international sample to determine whether country-level characteristics (e.g. creditor rights, shareholder rights and the enforcement climate) can influence this relationship. Furthermore, it can be worthwhile to deepen the analysis of CEO power and its impact on CEO compensation. It will be interesting to emphasize how the CEO power interacts with the other governance characteristics and some CEO attributes as CEO gender. Practical implications: The paper's findings have implications for practitioners, policymakers and regulatory authorities. First, the findings inform regulators that performance is not the only determinant of CEO pay level. This may warrant increased firm disclosure of the details of the pay structure. Second, the study offers insights to policymakers and members of boards of directors interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance, to better align managerial incentives to shareholder interests. Firms should strengthen the board independence and properly constitute the board committees (compensation, risk, nomination...). Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the CEO compensation determinants. It supplements the classic pay-for-performance sensitivity predictions with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory and managerial power theory. The authors develop a composite index to measure the CEO power in order to test the impact of CEO attributes on CEO pay. Additionally, it verifies whether the determinants of CEO pay depend on firm age and size. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to understand the relationship between the trust of executives in their board, board effectiveness (board performance and strategic decision quality) and organizational performance (financial and operational performance). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 184 board members in the Nordic region, using cross-sectional research design. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the used scales, whereas correlational analysis and mediation analysis via PROCESS macro in SPSS were used for testing of the hypotheses. Findings: Trust between board members is positively correlated with both dimensions of board effectiveness and both tested dimensions of organizational performance. Besides, trust between the board members positively affects both financial and operational performance (significant total effects in mediation analysis). However, trust had a direct effect only on financial performance, whereas it shows an indirect effect on operational performance through both mediators, board performance and strategic decision quality. Research limitations/implications: Future research should investigate trust into the board using a longitudinal design, and expand the sample cross-culturally, and control for the influence of other interpersonal variables in board members. Practical implications: The development of trust in work relationships serves as the foundation for the establishment of significant team and organizational benefits. Business leaders should take into consideration trust issues in business teams and cultivate a trust culture in their organizations. Social implications: The findings advance theoretical, social and empirical understanding of trust of executives in their board and its effect on board performance, strategic decision quality and perceived performance. The development of trust in work relationships enhances team performance, networks with strategic partners, community and government, and serves as the foundation for the establishment of trust in the society. Originality/value: This is one of the scarce studies that examines direct and indirect effects of trust in board and organizational outcomes. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to shed light on the effects of the CEO pay ratio and say-on-pay votes on directors' concerns about CEO pay equity. Investigation of the pay ratio disclosure rule offers opportunities to gain insights into whether equity perceptions associated with mandated pay ratio disclosure have significant effects on remuneration decisions in organizations. We conduct an online experiment with practicing corporate directors to examine the effects of CEO pay ratio disclosures and say-on-pay (SOP) votes on director decisions. Results indicate that CEO pay ratio disclosures significantly influence directors' decisions regarding executive compensation, leading directors to be less willing to increase CEO pay when the pay ratio is above the industry average pay ratio. Results also demonstrate that say-on-pay votes only influence directors' compensation decisions when the CEO pay ratio is above the industry average. Directors in firms with pay ratios that are above the industry average are less willing to increase CEO pay when they anticipate shareholder votes against a CEO pay increase than when they anticipate positive SOP voting outcomes. Directors in firms with CEO pay ratios that are below the industry average, however, are willing to increase CEO pay regardless of SOP voting outcomes. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This work aims to analyze the relationship between board independence and financial performance (variables ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q). Two perspectives on independence were used: (a) Law 964 of 2005 (mandatory in the Colombian stock market) and (b) an expanded view that included business relationships (cross-directorships, seniority on the board), financial relationships (compensation packages, ownership participation), and personal relationships (founders, members of the owner family) as factors that limit independence. Regression models (random effects) were used on an unbalanced data panel composed of 69 companies from the Colombian Stock Exchange. The results showed that a more rigorous definition of independence is better appreciated by the market. It was found that board independence does not affect accounting performance (ROA and ROE), but it does affect market performance (Tobin's Q). (c) 2021 Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

The board of directors' role is evolving and becoming more important in the wake of corporate scandals resulting in the collapse of large corporations and losses to shareholders. Poor governance can lead to wrong decision-making, which might destroy organizations, particularly during times of environmental turbulence. The 2008 Global Financial Crises followed by the 2011 Arab Spring throughout the MENA region and then the 2019 pandemic situation are few of many factors that created a turbulent economic and political environment for organizations, highlighting the importance of excellent decision-making skills. However, there is limited research on boards' decision-making during difficult times in the MENA region. The authors interviewed 26 board members of 21 companies operated under duress to examine the effects on boardroom level decision making of the magnified levels of duress and stress experienced during turbulent times. Key findings from the research include trends in emotional responses in relation to decision-making, changes in the decision-making process after crises, leadership positions, and board behavior. The authors recommend that boards incorporate diversity training and awareness into all levels of their decision-making process and to the board members' selection process. Future research should expand to different regions and industries and examine the effects of board members' personal traits and backgrounds on their quality of choices and decision-making.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

Much effort has been expended by the regulators in Jordan to enhance the code of corporate governance (CG); however, the effectiveness of CG mechanisms in monitoring management and enhancing the value of a firm is still a puzzle. This study aims to investigate the impact of CG and cash holdings (CH) on firm value as measured by the market-to-book ratio. The sample consists of all manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the years 2010-2017. The study hypotheses were tested using panel regression analysis. The research findings suggest that CH have a positive association with firm value, supporting the transaction and precautionary motives for holding cash. An interesting finding is that board expertise was found to be negatively associated with firm value. Gender diversity was found to be positively related to firm value, while board size, independence, and frequency of meetings were found to be insignificant. It seems that firms in Jordan regard strong CG mechanisms to be expensive and of little value in mitigating the negative effects of a weak legal system. These findings shed new light on the influence (or the lack of it) of boards in Jordanian firms. Consequently, the study recommends that the regulatory agencies in Jordan should consider improving governance codes and Rules to increase the effectiveness of the board and governance in general.

Every year, companies spend billions of dollars in board time and headhunter fees on CEO searches. In fact, by many accounts, the selection of the next CEO is the single most important task of the board of directors. Yet, despite the huge amount of time, money, and attention given to the task, many CEO changes fail, with disastrous consequences for all concerned.With so much at stake, it is natural to ask what companies and their boards can do to increase the odds of success. Illustrated with an abundance of real-life examples from interviews with CEOs, C-suite members, members of the boards, and headhunters supporting CEO searches, The Next CEO explains how boards can improve the odds of success with CEO succession by identifying clear CEO mandates and associated CEO profiles and by selecting CEOs that are fi t for purpose. It further explains how the CEOs of leading corporations effectively take charge and create results, providing a roadmap for incoming CEOs. These ideas are brought to life with case studies and interviews with well-known corporations such as ABB, Alibaba, Freudenberg, GE, Google, HNA, HP, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Nokia, Novartis, Roche, Sony, Tata, and Zurich Insurance.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The social entrepreneurship literature increasingly acknowledges that the board of directors is of major importance in dealing with the multiple goal pursuit of social enterprises. Using a team production perspective, we study the relationship between stakeholder knowledge in the board and the engagement of the board in counseling and decision-making (i.e., board service performance) and subsequent organizational performance. The results of our study, using a sample of Flemish social enterprises, reveal that board stakeholder knowledge is positively related to board service performance. This relationship is moderated by board behavioral integration, which is strengthening the relationship in case of high stakeholder knowledge. Finally, while board service performance is positively related to social performance and, specifically, the social goal of hiring disadvantaged people, it is not significantly related to financial performance.

Chapter 2 reveals that effective chairs of boards of directors in the UK are accomplished professionals with strong views, who lead the board without "taking up much space" and avoid the limelight. They engage directors in a collective effort, creating an environment for effective collaboration and encouraging productive behaviours by providing feedback and opportunities for collective and individual learning and development. They do not give orders or issue directives; instead they steer or nudge followers by setting agendas, framing discussion items, soliciting opinions, and seeking and providing feedback. They delineate their spheres with the CEOs--"I run the board; you run the company"--and strive to strike a fine balance between "equal distancing" and proactivity in relationships with shareholders. During the COVID-19 crisis chairs of British boards demonstrated resilience, commitment and adaptability. They quickly moved their board meetings into an online format, increased the frequency of their interactions and adjusted their agendas. Chairs of UK companies also significantly increased their time commitment and made themselves available round the clock. At the same time, most of them steered their boards away from interfering with the management's job.

This chapter explores issues related to what makes leadership teams effective, by considering how team composition and team processes affect performance in a global context. It combines concerns of leadership teams with new forms of organizing in global organizations. TankTerminal Limited is a storage and handling facility for petroleum products and crude oil located in the United Arab Emirates. Leadership teams are often seen as the people listed in an organization's annual reports as being on the board of directors and top-management teams (TMT). Boards of directors differ from TMTs in that they are not directly responsible for the day-to-day operations of an organization, but rather review major strategic decisions. Diversity poses a particular tension for leadership teams. Social categorization theory helps to explain the diversity-similarity tension in teams. Social categories are the groups that people are part of; they can vary from a team or a department to an organization or even a country.

The Board of directors is the steering wheel organisations use to achieve their goals and its composition has widely been analysed. This paper will show how the number of former government officials has increased in the board of large Spanish firms over the last two decades depending on the number of former government officials in the board and how regulated the industry is. The results will also show that even though there was a period in which more former government officials joined boards, the numbers have stabilised in recent years due to, among other factors, the increasing concerns in society related to the "revolving doors" behaviours.

This study examines the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and firm financial performance. Existing research has focused on the direct link between a proportion of women directors and firm economic outcomes, thus failing to account for possible mediating factors. Examining a panel dataset of 100 companies listed on the UK FTSE100 in the period 2009-2018, we integrated a set of women directors' attributes as mediators in the relationship between gender diversity and firm financial performance. After controlling for firm characteristics and reversed causality, the research supports the business case for board gender diversity and demonstrates the positive and mediating role of women's attributes on firm performance.

We attempt to bring clarity to the concept of strategic leadership and guide its development by reviewing and synthesizing the existing management literature on how top managers and board directors influence organizations. We propose a new definition of strategic leadership and offer a framework organized around the essential questions of what strategic leadership is, what strategic leaders do, why they do it, and how they do it. To answer these questions, we organize our review around the eight functions strategic leaders serve, the key attributes of strategic leaders, the theories scholars have used to relate these functions and attributes to outcomes, contextual factors, and the organizational outcomes that strategic leaders affect. We identify how strategic leadership research is concentrated in five streams that rarely interact with each other, and offer suggestions for connecting these streams. Our review provides a big picture of what is known about individuals at the top levels of organizations and highlights the key areas where future investigation is essential. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Design/methodology/approach: From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016-2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies' websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis. Findings: The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a company's decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)' global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairman's independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision. Research limitations/implications: The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies' decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers. Practical implications: The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairman's independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms. Social implications: Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure. Originality/value: The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies' social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.

Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n = 61 boards, n = 315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties. (c) 2021 The Author(s)

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

This special issue was developed to extend the boundaries of strategic leadership research, to help bridge the micro-macro divide regarding theories of strategic leadership, and to bring together theories that have emerged independently. In this introductory editorial, we provide an overview of the research on strategic leadership and emphasize the need for further integration of research from the organizational behavior, industrial and organizational psychology, organizational economics, behavioral strategy, and strategic management fields. We then introduce and summarize the eleven articles we accepted for this special issue by classifying them into two broad themes: (a) Chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics and (b) the dynamics of interactions among the CEO, the top management team, and the board. Finally, we propose recent theoretical and empirical foci for advancing strategic leadership research and offer a research agenda for future research highlighting several important research questions related to extending the dialogue among scholars across the different leadership and strategy domains.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light an important limit of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in pursuit of its substantial purpose, which is to achieve sustainability and contribute to achieving the objectives of United Nation (UN) Agenda 2030; the paper also suggests how to overcome those limits. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey of board members of listed and un-listed Italian companies. Data were analysed using an ordered probit model. Findings: The results show that a greater involvement of a board member in the non-financial reporting process is associated with a stronger commitment towards sustainable development. Specifically, the involvement in materiality assessment is positively associated with more proactive behaviours towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-reported assessments on beliefs and behaviours and the application of an online survey are methodology limitations of the study. Regarding theory, the study contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability, integrating upper echelons theory, which focuses on how individual attributes influence a firm's strategies and governance, with research on how leadership practices can have a positive impact on corporate sustainability goals. Practical implications: The paper underscores the opportunity for policymakers to increase the effectiveness of the NFRD through deeper involvement of the board members in the process of non-financial reporting. The results could also be of interest to governance bodies in terms of defining a board's tasks and practices to encourage the adoption of behaviours oriented towards a stronger engagement in sustainable issues. Originality/value: This is the first study to provide evidence of the relationship between individual directors' tasks and behaviours, non-financial reporting and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study highlights some of the limits of the NFRD, even after the public consultation to revise it, and suggests how to overcome these limits. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Diverse perspectives and ideas among senior leaders (top management teams and boards of directors) might generate substantial value for organizations. In theory, such diversity could provide a foundation for creative insights, innovative strategies, and strong organizational performance. Unfortunately, empirical research on these and other possible outcomes has generated a complex array of confusing findings. Our systematic review, the first to consider all types of relevant studies, attempts to make sense of the complicated landscape. On the negative side of the coin, the review highlights unsolved theoretical puzzles, severely fragmented empirical studies, and methodological conundrums. As a result, it calls into question several widespread assumptions and practices. On the positive side of the coin, our work surfaces some important pockets of consistency in existing empirical findings, mostly driven by studies using direct measures of cognitive diversity among senior leaders rather than demographic proxies. Our recommendations for the future include dramatically increasing qualitative research to move beyond a powerful deductive straightjacket that seems to exist. We also recommend taking a finer-grained approach through a substantial narrowing of quantitative research in the near term to better capture and understand key concepts, measures, and boundary conditions.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the role of alignment between organizational social consciousness and the informal and formal institutions of a country in increasing female representation on boards. Using fixed-effects and Hausman Taylor regression methodology for endogenous covariate with panel data for the years 2006-2020, we find that the greater the alignment between organizational social consciousness and certain formal (i.e., a gender quota) and informal (i.e., high gender equality) institutions, the more progress there is toward gender representation on corporate boards in Europe. We also find that more socially conscious firms make the most progress, often going beyond the minimum regulatory targets. By showing the complementarity of these factors, we address the enduring question of how the interplay of formal and informal institutions directly affects corporate behavior, thus contributing to the institutional, public policy/regulatory, and corporate governance literatures. We note the need for policymakers to go beyond mere codification of rules via quotas and simultaneously work toward raising national and organizational social consciousness levels on issues of gender equality.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

We examine the relationship between women directors and corporate social performance (CSP) by considering the contingency effects of home-country culture. Drawing on upper echelons and social role theories, we hypothesize that greater women representation on boards positively affects CSP due to their distinctive expertise, perspectives, and knowledge in this area, which strengthen their firms' attention and resources devoted to it. We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors' views and boards' openness to them. Based on data for 3175 firms across 38 countries between 2008 and 2015, our multilevel analysis provides support for most of our hypotheses. (c) 2022, Academy of International Business.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of the board of directors on the strategic decisions made by family firms, and to understand the board attributes that can alleviate the aversion of family-owned firms toward mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of several firms listed in India from 2006 to 2019 with 19,813 firm-year observations. The empirical tests have been performed using logistic and negative binomial regressions. The study also tests for endogeneity with the help of Heckman (1979) two-step treatment effects model. Findings: The study shows that board characteristics like smaller board-size, presence of outside directors, lower intensity of board activity, presence of busier board members and separation of board chair and CEO positions alleviate the inhibition of family firms toward M&A. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that investors and policymakers can encourage family firms to have smaller boards, more independent directors, passive boards and CEO nonduality to reduce their aversion toward risky activities. Family-owned firms could consider a board comprising members with multiple directorships who can bring wider knowledge and expertise which can reduce the perceived threat to socioemotional wealth (SEW) and alleviate their aversion toward M&A. Originality/value: Ownership concentration in family firms posits a unique challenge in terms of their aversion toward M&A. This study is one of the few that highlight the relevance of the monitoring and advisory role of the board in alleviating this aversion in an emerging market like India.

This study examines the effect of board size on the economic impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the US. Using a hand-collected dataset of 508 M&A between 2012 and 2018, we find that board size is negatively related to acquirer excess returns. In an additional analysis, we show that large boards have positive value implications for banks that combine the CEO and chairman roles as well as for large banks. Our findings indicate that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to board size is not necessarily in the interests of shareholders; instead, a more flexible and proactive formulation is needed.

Public corporations often appoint external former founders to their boards in hope that they will encourage a (re-)focus on creating future new business. Seeking to investigate this common practice, we integrate upper echelons theory with imprinting theory, arguing that founding a company indeed represents a formative experience that will leave an imprint on founders and their subsequent board decision-making. Subsequent to their founding experience, however, some founders may be subjected to likewise formative but public corporate experiences, for instance, by taking their own business public or by assuming CEO positions in other corporations, that will lead to a decay of the original founding imprint and its effect. We find support for our reasoning across corporate boards in S&P1500 firms ranging from 2000 to 2012. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Firm leaders expect their chief marketing officers (CMOs) to have significant impact on firm performance, and boards of directors (boards) consider marketing-related issues critical board-level priorities. Despite the importance of marketers and marketing to firm outcomes, boards do not appear to value CMOs at the strategy-setting level of the firm as they rarely include CMOs in board discussions and deliberations. The disconnect between the importance of marketing and the marginalization of marketers at the board level prompts the following question: How and in what ways may boards impact CMO performance? This research includes two reviews of the extant literature (from 1984 through 2021): (1) board impact on CMOs, and (2) board impact on the satisfaction, performance, and outcomes of the broader top management team (TMT), including chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief operating officers, chief technology officers, and chief strategy officers. We find that only four articles investigate the impact of boards on any functional TMT member's performance and that none specifically consider how the board may impact CMO satisfaction, performance, and outcomes. Given the lack of research, we create a conceptual framework that links board characteristics to CMO outcomes and develop a research agenda with over 50 questions as the basis to develop scholarship. Importantly, this research highlights the paucity of insight regarding board-level influence on any functional TMT member, including the CMO. Consequently, the model and research agenda can benefit multiple disciplines including marketing, finance, information technology, operations, management, and human resources.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

The current study examines the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures, media announcements of CSR awards and a firm's cost of debt in Malaysia. The sample consists of 104 Malaysian publicly listed companies belonging to the Edge Billion Ringgit Club between 2009 to 2015. The study uses panel data regression analysis and the ordinary least squares estimation method. The results find that the interaction between CSR disclosures and winning awards for a company's CSR initiatives and practices lowers the cost of debt. Our study concludes that, when a company discloses more information on its CSR initiatives and practices, it reduces the cost of debt. Thus, we argue that CSR disclosures and awards can act as proxies for branding listed firms, making them more marketable and allowing them to negotiate better debt contracts. However, the study shows that politically connected companies have a higher debt cost than non-politically connected firms. Furthermore, our results indicate that smaller boards are effective, but audit committees are not effective in monitoring the board of directors in Malaysian listed firms. (c) 2022 by the authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the direct association between firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores, CSR disclosures and executive compensation. This study further investigates the moderating role of CSR in the association between executive compensation and firms' stock market and accounting performances. Design/methodology/approach: This study collects CEO compensation information from the Execucomp database and CSR performance information from the MSCI ESG database. The final sample consists of 4,193 firm-year observations for 1,318 US public firms for the period 2009-2013. This study uses lagged regression analysis to test the direct and moderating roles of CSR in executive compensation. Findings: Regarding the direct role of CSR, this study finds that CEO compensation is positively related to CSR performance but not to firms' issuance of CSR reports. This study also finds a positive moderating role of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' stock performance. However, the authors do not identify any role for CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and accounting performance. The results also show a negative association of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firm size. Originality/value: This study fills a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on the direct association between CSR and CEO compensation and how the association between CEO compensation and firm performance is moderated by CSR scores. The novel findings of this study will benefit managers, boards of directors, shareholders and other stakeholders, including regulators and policymakers. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Many studies on the impact of boards of directors on corporate social responsibility have focused on the human capital of board members (i.e., structures and characteristics). However, the relational capital of board members (i.e., board interlock centrality) has yet to be fully explored. This study examines the extent to which board members are connected in their networks (i.e., board interlock centrality) on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in the restaurant industry. It also recognizes the moderating role of board effectiveness on the relationship between board centrality and CSR performance. On the basis of organization legitimacy theory and resource dependence theory, this study found that high-centrality boards increase positive CSR performance. The effect is more substantial when a firm has more standing board committees. The theories view firms as components of the larger social environment, and their performance depends on their ability to procure crucial resources from other firms through mutual exchange. No significant link was found between negative CSR performance and the moderating effect of board committees. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

The objective of this case-based study is to understand how the dyadic interaction between the key governance actors can influence the decision-making aimed at directing and controlling a family firm. The study provides evidence that dyadic interaction at the back stage of the formal governance process can offer a privileged position for the family firm owners who serve on the board, and the non-family member Chair of the Board, to influence decision-making before, after and between board meetings. The cases studied suggest that dyadic interactions can serve as preparation for formal board processes and complement and clarify them, yet they also have the potential to conflict with them. Dyadic interaction is also shown to offer important relational and emotional benefits that may not necessarily be achieved through larger group interaction. The findings suggest that although the actors can self-regulate their behaviour through informal rules, the rules may imperfectly address one risk of dyadic interaction--the reduced cognitive conflict among the board.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This paper aims to investigate the effect of the quality of compensation committee on the self-interested board of directors after the establishment of mandatory compensation committee. Moreover, this paper investigates the role of CEO power in the relationship between compensation committee quality and the self-interested board of directors. From the data of listed companies between 2012 and 2017, we find that firms with better compensation committees and higher CEO power can reduce the phenomenon of loss making firms yet increasing their director and supervisor compensation. However, we also find that CEO power cannot moderate the relationship between the quality of a compensation committee and a board compensation increase in a loss-making firm. Our results demonstrate that when the CEO has greater power, the compensation committee is less effective to prevent the board of directors and supervisors in loss-making firms from gaining unreasonably high compensation.

Priorliterature does not provide a clear prediction of how executive confidence affects the degree to which a firm engages in "myopic marketing management," the tendency to decrease current marketing spending to mitigate any potential earnings shortfall. We propose that highly confident CEOs are more likely to cut marketing spending to raise current earnings numbers because they believe in their ability to generate high future firm earnings that can cover the long-term losses arising from their current short-term actions. The effect is heightened when the board of directors is more independent and monitors more, but attenuated if CMOs are more confident and thus are better able to convince their CEOs and boards of directors to support continued investments in marketing. The moderating impact of CMO confidence is proposed to be stronger as the CMO becomes more powerful. Using secondary data from a broad cross-section of firms, we provide robust empirical support for our model. Our results highlight situations in which CMOs need to be wary of cuts to their marketing budget, and also provide a potential mechanism through which marketers can protect their budget in the presence of highly confident CEOs--through their own confidence levels.

The role of entrepreneurial alertness has been increasing to cope with the current fiercely competitive market. Entrepreneurial alertness enables companies to benefit from unseized opportunities and gain a competitive advantage. Therefore, the study explores the role of proactive behavior in enhancing the entrepreneurial alertness of organizations through the mediating role of dynamic capabilities. The study focuses on the Iraqi telecommunication market because of the intense competition between three major telecom companies. Data were collected through a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire distributed among employees of mobile telecommunications companies in Iraq. The sample aimed to cover different levels in the business hierarchy with a particular focus on the leading positions. Therefore, it included 299 members of boards of directors, branch managers, department heads, and chief supervisors (middle managers). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the responses. Results revealed the positive effect of adopting proactive behavior (e.g., problem prevention, innovation, and holding responsibilities) on entrepreneurial alertness (e.g., scanning, searching for, and evaluating opportunities). The results also approved the mediating role of dynamic capabilities in enhancing the relationship between proactive behavior and entrepreneurial alertness. Therefore, Iraqi governmental telecommunication enterprises are recommended to benefit from the dynamic capabilities of employees (e.g., sensing, learning, integrating, and coordinating capabilities) to maximize the positive influence of proactive behavior on entrepreneurial alertness and, accordingly, improve the prediction of production risks and threats.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on resource dependence theory we argue for an influence of business groups (BGs) on the board composition of constituent offshore financial multinational enterprises (FMNEs). Using a unique sample of 171 Caribbean FMNEs in an inter-island BG setting, we find BGs' control in constituent firms to be indicative of the importance of the internal financing and intermediation within the group network. This control leads to a higher proportion of lawyers hired to the boards of directors in BG-constituent firms and supports the argument that lawyers provide skills in complex offshore regulatory frameworks that facilitate BGs' optimal tax management. Furthermore, we observe that an increased adoption of shareholder rights governance by BG-constituent firms is associated with increased engagement with outside resource providers, increased potential conflicts of interest and hence a need for hiring more lawyers. Our interpretation is that offshore FMNEs have a need for more lawyers, whose legal skill is critical to the competitive advantage of FMNEs. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between chair-chief executive officer (CEO) demographic dissimilarities and firm internationalization. Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of listed firms in Malaysia from 2013 to 2017. This study considers three demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, i.e. differences in age, educational background and nationality. Findings: The results reveal that demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, notably differences in nationality, may result in conflicting cognitive styles, which in turn may impede the firms' ability to expand internationally, as compared to differences in age and educational background. The findings demonstrate the deleterious effects of demographic dissimilarity between these two individuals in the highest echelons on the firms' internationalization strategy due to poor communication and lack of ability to cooperate when dissatisfaction and conflicts intensify between these corporate elites. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt to examine the influence of chair-CEO demographic dissimilarities on firm internationalization. Previous studies examining firms' internationalization strategy, for the most part, restricted their scope to either the board members or top management team characteristics, but had largely overlooked the nexus between nonexecutive and executive directors through the chair and CEO. A focus on the demographic dissimilarities between the co-leaders of the firm is essential to improve the understanding of the collaboration and rivalry between them, which may affect board effectiveness and firm internationalization.

This study investigates the association between a CEO's political ideology and Corporate Environmental Performance. Although previous research has established a strong association between a CEO's political ideology and overall performance on Corporate Social Responsibility, little research has examined how it relates to a firm's environmental impact. Utilizing data on CEO political donations, this study shows that a CEO's liberalism generally has a positive effect on a firm's environmental performance. However, this relationship can be influenced by the political conservatism of the board of directors. Furthermore, liberal CEOs are inclined to prioritize environmental strength and minimize environmental concerns. This research provides insight into the intricate dynamics of how a CEO's political ideology, as well as that of the board of directors, can influence a firm's environmental performance.

This paper aims to find an answer to the questions of "whether chief executive officers (CEOs) are compensated for market risk", and "how the combined interaction of board size and CEO duality moderates this relationship" from the tenets of agency theory and managerial power theory. Even though the contracting view of agency theory posits that agents are neither to be punished nor rewarded for events that go beyond their direct control (market risk), the research findings in the corporate governance domain are contradictory. It was found that Chinese and American executives were paid for market risk, including oil prices and exchange rates, which was explained by retention risk and weaker corporate governance systems. To shed light on previous inconclusive research, this paper investigates the topic further in a new country setting, that of Switzerland, because the previous results were mostly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. Switzerland is also one of the exemplary countries for executive compensation. Furthermore, it investigates the combined (cascaded) interaction effects of the board size and CEO duality on CEO compensation and market risk from the perspective of managerial power theory, which has not been previously analyzed in the literature to date. For the direct effect, in contrast to previous findings in Anglo-Saxon countries, it has been found that CEOs were not paid for market risk in Switzerland, which confirms agency theory's contracting prediction. This finding outlines the future comparative research area in this domain. For the combined interaction effect, it has been found that board size incorporated with CEO duality is the significant cascaded moderator, and large boards with CEO duality are significantly more effective in controlling asymmetric compensation, which confirms the efficacy of large boards with CEO duality in coping with asymmetric compensation and managerial entrenchment (managerial power theory). These results have both practical and academic implications for boards of directors, Human Resources and corporate governance literature, agency theory, and managerial power theory, by providing further evidence on previous inconclusive findings on board size, CEO duality, and the role of market risk in the CEO pay structure.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

The board of directors' behavioral dynamics can strongly influence an entrepreneurial firm's success. Drawing on the behavioral theory of corporate governance, this study identifies and tests factors that facilitate behavioral integration in boards of high technology start-ups. We unpack the black box of board behavior with primary data collected from a survey-based sample of 149 CEOs of Norwegian high-tech start-ups supplemented by quantitative archival information. We find that intra-board behavioral integration (i.e., board members' propensity to clearly understand one another's issues and needs, actively solve, and share relevant information and resources) is positively affected by greater levels of informal communication between CEOs and board members. Next, we find that inter-board trust (i.e., board members interact with absolute integrity, tell the truth at meetings, trust one another, and keep mutual promises) mediates this relationship such that higher levels of inter-board trust result in greater concordance between information communication frequency and inter-board behavioral integration. We then examine the role of an efficacious board chair who motivates and uses each board member's competence, formulates proposals for decisions and summarizes conclusions after board negotiation, and chairs board discussions without promoting their agenda, finding that efficacious board chair leadership moderates the relationship between informal communication frequency and intra-board trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by developing a new theory that explains Founder-CEOs' succession in family and non-family firms. Many scholars failed to generate a specific theory to describe the succession of Founder-CEOs. Family firms remain complex enterprises comprising interconnectedness of cultural interests in which corporate governance occurs by families, Founder-CEOs and sometimes a board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This study's design/methodology/approach reflects post-modernist epistemological and ontological perspectives for conducting systematic literature reviews. To identify relevant studies in the review, the several databases (Australian Business Dean's Council Journal Quality List; EBSCO Database, including PsycINFO and Psych studies; Web of Science) and a mix of ranked journals from entrepreneurship, management and psychology were used. Findings: The findings and results in this paper reflect the purpose, methodology and literature analysis culminating in 1,582 peer-reviewed studies. A total of 182 peer-reviewed studies met the criterion for review. Throughout the research process, a systematic literature review uncovered management literature gaps overlooked for decades during the theory-building process. Hence, developing a theory of Founder-CEOs succession used a combination of systematic, inductive, comparative and interactive approaches. Originality/value: A Theory of Founder-CEOs Succession explains the strategic process of replacing a founder systematically. The promotion of, and incentives for, internal executives have been topics of great interest and deliberation among scholars and practitioners for a long time. This study contributes research implications for theory building in the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by offering scholars and practitioners a theory that does not exist to describe Founder-CEOs' succession encompassing both strategic successes and failures. By incorporating successes and failures, this study provides realistic reflections of Founder-CEOs. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The research problem This study investigates the relationship between the incentive of Japanese non-profit organizations to avoid losing their tax-exempt status and the extent of tax-motivated expense allocation. Motivation Prior studies have shown that for joint overhead expenses, organizations can lower their tax burden by transferring costs from non-taxable to taxable activities. However, tax authorities may also investigate non-profits that report excessive profits without incurring expenses for non-taxable activities and penalize them by depriving them of their tax-exempt status. This deprivation of tax exemptions specific to non-profit organizations causes serious problems for such organizations in terms of the economic impact of increased income taxes and the loss of social value from donors. In Japan, non-profit organizations are deprived of tax-exempt status if the ratio of expenses from taxable activities to total expenses (TaxExpRatio) exceeds a regulatory threshold of 50%. We estimated the tax-motivated expense allocation and non-taxable activities, defining the term TaxExpRatio before the allocation as TRBA. In addition, we assumed that a larger board of directors has a stronger incentive to protect the non-profit's tax-exempt assets because individuals or organizations that provide resources to non-profits often become board members, who thus conduct stronger monitoring to avoid losing the tax-exempt status. The test hypotheses We hypothesized that when the TRBA exceeds the regulatory threshold, non-profits allocate less discretionary expense to taxable activities. We further posited that board size moderates the relationship between the TRBA exceeding the regulatory threshold and allocation of discretionary expenses to taxable activities. Target population We specifically considered the Japanese regulatory environment related to public-interest incorporated associations and foundations (PIIAs and PIIFs, referred to as Japanese non-profit organizations), which are tax-exempt organizations engaged in a wide range of public work. Adopted methodology We estimated the expense allocated from non-taxable to taxable activities in a non-profit organization based on Hofmann (2007) and Omer & Yetman (2007). We also estimated regressions using pooled cross-sectional and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Analysis By using 12,027 firm-year observations (4,763 distinct non-profit organizations in Japan), we estimated the regression model for the incentive to avoid losing tax-exempt status in non-profit organizations. Findings We found that non-profits with TRBA over the regulatory threshold tend to allocate less expenses to taxable activities. In addition, the empirical results show that the relationship between TRBA over the regulatory threshold and allocated expenses to taxable activities is moderated by board size. This finding suggests that larger boards in non-profit organizations are more incentivized to reduce tax avoidance behavior that may result in losing their tax-exempt status. (c) 2023 The Author(s).
