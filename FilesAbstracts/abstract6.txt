Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

The banana crop has great socio-economic importance in Madeira Island, with 'Dwarf Cavendish' being the traditional cultivar. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adaptation of the cultivars 'Grande Naine', 'Williams', 'Zelig', 'Eilon', and 'Chinese Cavendish' to the edafoclimatic conditions of Madeira. This study presents the results of the first three cycles of production. The results show that the cultivar 'Grande Naine' is the most productive and the one that has the highest pseudostem.

A two year trial was set up to test the viability of single-cycle cultivation using hardened vitro plants of Grande Naine (pseudostem height =45 cm and =4.5 cm thickness), at a spacing of 5.0 m x 2.5 m with 3 plants per hole (2,400 plants/ha). Twelve months after the beginning of the trial, a new planting was inserted between the existing plants, with the same spatial arrangement. The first crop was harvested 14 months after planting and the second 12 months later, thus effectively obtaining an annual crop; yields were 73.1 ton/ha and 77.7 ton/ha, respectively, with more of 90% of the fruit qualified as Extra. A comparative study of harvest date and yield was made between the three plants of each hole. Results showed significant differences due to orientation although absolute differences were slight.

The effect of three spacings on plant growth, yield and cycle duration of 'Nanicao' Cavendish banana was studied in an alluvium soil, in Guaramirim, North Coast of Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Spacings of 2.0 x 3.0, 2.0 x 2.5 and 2.0 x 2.0 meters were tested, with one follower per cycle. The increase in plant density, practically, did not affected the final development in the two first cycles, but reduced both the pseudostem perimeter from the second ratoon cycle and plant height from the fourth ratoon cycle on. The strong density effect on the yield per cycle, verified in the plant crop and first ratoon cycles, became unimportant from the second ratoon cycle on, due to less bunch weight in higher densities in these cycles. The increase in the density led to a longer crop cycle, mainly from the first ratoon cycle on. In this way, the total yield over a 98-month period tends to the balance among the treatments.

The distribution of roots in banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth using intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from flowering plants. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant (P= 0.0001) effect of soil depth, and also a significant (P= 0.0006) interaction between soil depth and horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depths. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of the soil (40.1%). Above 65.1% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of the soil. More than 79.4% and 88.1% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the stem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 Kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180, and 210 cm, and flower stalk emergence plants, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification pattern are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

Mass propagation of bananas through in vitro techniques can lead to a high percentage of non-true-to-type (somaclonal variants) plants. Variation has been found for: plant height, leaf shape and colour, pseudostem morphology and colour, reproductive organs morphology and sucker emission rate. Some of these somaclonal variants, such as the extra-dwarf or variegated types, might be interesting for their use in landscaping or for indoor pot cultivation. Growth regulators could be used to modify the growth habits of banana plants for ornamental purposes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

An experiment was carried out at the Mohanpur, during 1997 and 1998 to assess the impact of retaining parent pseudostem at different height (s) on growth and yield of first ratoon sucker(s) severed/non-severed with the parent pseudostem in dwarf cavendish banana (Musa, AAA) cultivar. Giant Governor. Retention of untopped parent pseudostem gave maximum height and girth of the connected/non-severed suckers compared with the retention of parent pseudostem cut at mid height and corm level. Leaf size and total leaf production were markedly increased while bunch emergence was delayed in the connected/non-severed suckers by retaining untopped parent pseudostem. Retention of single sucker connected/non-severed with the untopped parent pseudostem exhibited highest finger weight and yield/plant over the severed suckers and parent pseudostem cut at mid height and corm revel. But the fruit yield/ha was recorded highest with retention of two suckers connected/non-severed with untopped parent pseudostem.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. © 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this work was to characterize and evaluate the behavior of 13 banana genotypes (varieties and hybrids) AAA, AAAA, AAB and AAAB genomic groups, in two production cycles in southwest Bahia, using relevant phenotypic descriptors for the identification and selection of superior individuals. The Prata Anã and Pacovan (AAB), Grande Naine and Nanicão (AAA) varieties and the hybrids PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Japira, Preciosa and ST12-31 (AAAB) and Ambrosia, Calipso, Bucaneiro and FHIA-02 (AAAA), selected at Embrapa Cassava and Fruit Crops, were evaluated. The experimental design was in random blocks, with 13 treatments, five repetitions, 20 plants per plot, six useful and 3.00 m x 2.00 m spacing. The following characteristics were considered: Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of live leaves during flowering and harvest, number of days from planting to flowering and until harvest, bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, weight, length and diameter of fruit. Grande Naine, and Nanicão stood out for the characteristics of bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, fruit weight and length; the FHIA-02 hybrid presented greater fruit diameter in both production cycles and the earliest flowering and harvest in the second cycle; Calipso was the latest for harvest; ST12-31 was the tallest in height; the Prata Anã variety stood out for number of live leaves during flowering and harvest; the Prata type hybrids, PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Preciosa and Japira, stood out for the parameters related to fruit quality when compared to its genitors Prata Anã and Pacovan, respectively; there was an increment of the parameters that reflected vegetative growth and yield from the first to the second production cycle for all genotypes evaluated.

The practices of repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning methods of enset (Ensete ventricosum) plants are not consistent over enset growing areas. Current yield levels in enset production are relatively low and vary between growing areas depending on the different repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning practices. Patterns of enset plant growth over the entire growing season and relative distribution and accumulation of dry matter to the harvestable parts of the crop as influenced by the different practices are important parameters to understand and modify the management practices in an effort to increase the yield of the plant. Influence of repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning methods on growth, dry matter partitioning and dry matter production were studied at the Areka Research Centre, North Omo, Southern Ethiopia. Transplanting treatments significantly affected height, circumference of pseudostem and dry matter yield of corm and pseudostem at all harvest dates. Increase in dry matter was earlier in once (T1) compared to twice (T2) and thrice (T3) treatments. Maximum total plant dry matter yield per unit space of T1 and T2 transplanted enset suckers was obtained at flowering at 104 and 234 weeks after first transplanting, respectively. Repetitive transplanting reduced the fitted maximum rate of increase (g m-2 week-1) compared to direct transplanting. The dry matter partitioning to the harvestable parts however, were increased as a result of repetitive transplanting. Partitioning of dry matter to the harvestable organs of the plant seems more important than total dry matter production for determining kocho yield of enset plants. For early yield, livestock feed and other purposes however direct transplanting might be practical. Leaf pruning alone or the interaction between leaf pruning and transplanting did not significantly affect dry matter production and partitioning. Circumference of the pseudostem seems a good indicator for high yield of kocho. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the phytotechnical behavior of 'Prata-Anã' banana and four progeny hybrids, during two production cycles, in the Perímetro Irrigado do Estreito, southwest of Bahia state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Anã' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Anã' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Anã'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Anã' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. © 2009 Academic Journals.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. © 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalán, Veracruz, México. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca≥P≥Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Urabá region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

The effects of chicken manure as a soil amendment and the application of nematicides on plant characteristics, yield and foliar nutrient content of the African Rhino plantain clone were evaluated. Chemical properties of the soil were monitored after chicken manure application. Chicken manure, at a rate of 25 t/ha, was incorporated during soil preparation. The nematicide treatment included the use of etoprop at planting, followed by oxamyl at six and 12 months after planting. The application of chicken manure significantly increased the height and diameter of the pseudostem, reduced the number of days from planting to shooting, and increased bunch weight, and yield per hectare. With the use of chicken manure a yield of 34,242 kg/ha was obtained. This yield represents a 33% increase over that of the treatment without chicken manure. The use of nematicides significantly diminished the number of collapsed plants and increased plantain yield. The use of chicken manure increased the foliar content of N and Ca whereas the use of nematicide had no effect on any of the nutrient foliar content. The chemical properties of the soil (pH; organic matter; electric conductivity; N, P, K, Ca and Mg content) were not affected by the use of chicken manure.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

'Namwa' (ABB) banana found in Thailand and Southeast Asia is composed of many related cultivars. With their versatile utilization, understanding their development and fruit ×uality leads to the appropriate production and management. This research aimed to investigate their growth and yield from eight clones including 'Namwa Pak Chong 50' (PC50), 'Namwa Mali Ong' (ML), 'Namwa Tanao Si' (TNS), 'Namwa Ngoen' (NWN), 'Namwa Khom' (NWK), 'Nam Vo' (NV), 'Namwa Thong Ma Eng' (TME) and 'Namwa Dam' (NWD). The field trial was conducted at Pak Chong Research Station from January 2010 to June 2011 with Randomized Complete Block Design. The data revealed that NV produced the tallest pseudostem of 4.1 m but NWK the shortest at 2.7 m while the rest were 3.7-4.0 m tall. PC50 and TME needed the shortest vegetative period, taking only 37-38 weeks from planting to flower bud emergence, while the others took 40-44 weeks. TME, NWD and NWC took 14-20 days for flowering (bract opening period) whereas the rest 21-24 days. All cultivars could be harvested for fruit by 58-60 weeks after planting except for TNS and NWD at 62-64 weeks. NWK yielded the highest in bunch weight at 31 kg followed by NWN, NV and TME (28 kg) while the others at 19-25 kg. This resulted in the highest hands/bunch (12.4) and fingers/bunch (241) for NWC while 9.4-10.2 hands/bunch and 150-170 fingers/bunch for others. NV provided the largest mature green finger while NWK and TNS the smallest. The pedicel length and peel thickness varied from cultivar to cultivar. All cultivars at ripe stage had pulp total soluble solids at about 25.5-27.5% with pulp firmness at 1.57-2.06 N cm-2 which was not significantly different among the cultivars. The results suggested that the cultivar members in the 'Namwa' group are different in their plant performance and produce. This possibly leads to their different utilization.

An experiment was conducted at Instructional Farm of Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Pundibari, West Bengal (India) during 2012 to 2014. Tissue culture plantlets were superior than conventional suckers in terms of yield and income with better growth and yield parameters. The highest pseudostem height (219.76 cm), pseudostem girth (73.95 cm), number of suckers (8.75), number of leaves (23.37), leaf length (187.76 cm), leaf breadth (53.80 cm), leaf area (1.01 m2), and yield attributes like bunch length (81.25 cm), bunch diameter (36.24 cm), bunch weight (25.38 kg), hands per bunch (25.38), fingers per bunch (156.13), finger length (16.13 cm), finger diameter (3.61 cm) and finger weight (330.88 g) were also significantly higher in tissue culture plants than the sucker grown plants. The lengthened phyllocron (15.11 days), days taken to shooting (372.25 days) and shooting to maturity (108.50 days) was noted in plantation raised with conventiontional sucker. Tissue culture crop yielded 63.44 t/ha, which was 39.43% higher than the yield of conventional sucker (45.50 t/ha) grown crop and as a result crop grown with tissue culture plantlets had a benefit cost ratio of 2.25 as compared to 1.65 of crop grown with conventional suckers. The farmers of Terai zone of West Bengal can establish their banana plantation using tissue culture plantlets of banana cv. Grand Naine, if available or otherwise can be done through suckers.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

An experiment was conducted at Bukit Perawas Ayer Lanas, Jeli Kelantan from December 2014 to April 2015 to study the effect of different rates of foliar fertiliser at vegetative stage for banana cultivation. Four levels of foliar fertiliser (0 ml L-1 [control], 1 ml L-1, 2 ml L-1 and 3 ml L-1) were applied monthly throughout the experimental period. Inorganic foliar fertiliser formulation HI-NKTM, a product of ACM Sdn. Bhd, was used. It consisted of 16:8:16 of NPK and a few trace elements Fe, Mn, Mo, Cu, Zn, B and Mo. Data on growth parameters such as pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area were recorded for the first 16 weeks of planting. A logistic growth model was used to predict the response of the banana plant to foliar fertiliser (from the 16th week to the 24th week of planting). The highest vegetative growth (pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area) was yielded by the treatment that used foliar fertiliser was applied at 1 ml L-1. The earliest results of plant growth response for treatment A, B and C could be seen in the second week of planting. The treatments followed the logistic growth curve in R2 ranging from 0.92 to 0.96. The pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area of the banana plants applied with 1 ml L-1 at the 16th week of planting were 59.87 cm, 20.53 cm and 1718.28 cm2, respectively. The prediction showed the maximum pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area at the 24th week of planting at the rate of 1 ml L-1 were 59.3 cm, 19.91 cm and 1785.17 cm2, respectively. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).
