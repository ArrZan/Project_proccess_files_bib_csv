The board decision making process in two Human Service Organizations was examined through observational methods. Some important difficulties were seen in these processes. Among them were lack of decision, poor timing of decision, swayed focus, and unclear utilization of human energy. The possible reasons for these problems are explored, and some policy implications suggested. (c) Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (North-Holland).

Advocates of board of director reform suggest that outsider dominated boards take a more active role in promoting the financial performance of the firm. Although a number of studies have examined the board composition/financial performance relationship, this study is unique in three respects. It adds risk-adjusted market return as a performance variable in board composition/financial performance studies and finds a direct relationship between outside directors representation on the board and corporate financial performance. Finally, the analysis is extended to incorporate the dividend decision of the firm. The findings provide evidence that board composition affects dividend policy. (c) 1989, Sage Publications.

This paper reports the results of three empirical studies of boards of directors in small enterprises in Norway. Most studies of boards of directors are concerned with the situation in large corporations. This article provides insights into board attributes and board functions in small firms. The Studies reported found that board composition is an important factor in describing and analyzing directorates. They also found that the composition of the board of directors is a function of company size and ownership structure, and that board composition varies with industry. The studies found differences in the board's strategy involvement between industries. (c) 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Prescriptive approaches place the nonprofit board of directors at the hierarchical pinnacle of the organization's management structure. Empirical research finds this view incomplete at best. The results of an attribution study indicate that nonprofit chief executives are perceived as centrally responsible for outcomes. Given such centrality, what skills differentiate executives who are regarded as especially effective from others? This article describes research suggesting that more-effective executives provide leadership for their boards. The implications for executive behavior are reviewed.

A typology of the relative powers of the chief executive officer and the board of directors was derived based on the literature, highlighting four situations: Caretaker, Statutory, Proactive and Participative boards. Data collected from Fortune 500 Industrial and Fortune 500 Service corporations supported the typology. The results showed significant differences among the four board types in their characteristics, internal process, decision-making styles, board effectiveness, and contribution to company performance. Powerful boards were associated with superior corporate financial performance. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A set of proposals on corporate conduct, prepared under the auspices of the National Companies and Securities Commission, was widely circulated for discussion during 1990 and issued in its final form in December. The proposals constitute a self-regulatory code which may significantly influence the control and decision-making structures of listed companies, particularly through its guidelines on the composition of the board of directors. This paper concludes that there is evidence that further regulating board memberships could impose costs on shareholders of companies which favour certain board structures. (c) 1991 CPA Australia

This study examined the association between corporations'environments, strategies, and past performance and the composition of their boards of directors as measured by size and outside director representation. The environment, strategy and past performance were viewed as posing a strategic contingency; each of these sets could determine the success or failure of the company. Data on 119 Fortune 500 industrial companies for the 1983-9 period were used. Canonical analysis showed that increased uncertainty of a firm's environment, use of external growth and diversification; reliance on leverage as a means of finance, and poor past financial performance were associated with large board size and increased outside representation in subsequent years. Most important, board composition was positively associated with future measurements of corporate financial performance. Copyright (c) 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Based on a survey of 2,361 directors in 291 of the largest companies of the Southeast States, this study empirically examined boards of directors' stakeholder orientations. The results indicate that (1) there exist distinct stakeholder groups perceived by directors, (2) directors have high stakeholder orientations, (3) directors view some stakeholders differently depending on their occupation (CEO directors v. non-CEO directors) and type (inside directors vs. outside directors).

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

This paper analyzes the direction and magnitude of changes in stock prices resulting from the announcement of various types of changes in senior corporate management over a twelve-year period. We find support for the view that instability resulting from executive succession adversely affects organizational performance. Furthermore, our results imply a clear preference by the market for a change in composition of the previous management team over its further entrenchment and a perception by the market that senior corporate executives and the board of directors may not be solely motivated by considerations of shareholder wealth maximization.

This study examines an important potential conflict between the institutional, governance, and strategic functions of boards. We specifically test how higher levels of board size and diversity, traditionally associated with optimal institutional and governance performance of boards, affect the boards ability to initiate strategic changes during periods of environmental turbulence. Our findings suggest that board diversity, in particular, may be a significant constraint on strategic change. Copyright (c) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This study examines whether, how, and under what conditions nonprofit boards of directors influence the government and voluntary sector relationship. The survey responses of executive directors and board presidents in a randomly selected sample of 400 nonprofit organizations indicate that boards are not bystanders in the contracting relationship with government. Rather, many boards play multiple roles, simultaneously enhancing interdependence and maintaining the boundary between state government and nonprofits.

This paper examines all New Zealand listed public companies in the years 1987, 1990 and 1993 to highlight changes over time in interlocking directorates. Potential company and individual director interlocks, as well as average board size, are found to have decreased since 1984. This points to a marked reversal of the trends identified in Firth (1987). The prevalence of interlocks in New Zealand appears no greater than in Australia and may fall with the implementation of the Companies Act 1993. (c) 1994, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The corporate board is a common feature of both private sector and public sector enterprises. The roles undertaken by boards are therefore a significant area of interest for writers on organizations. This paper makes two contributions to the study of corporate hoards. First, it presents the results of an intensive study of the performance of the board of directors of a first wave National Health Service (NHS) Trust based on three sources of data: actors' accounts; minutes; and observation. This study concludes that the board has made only a marginal contribution to the governance of the Trust. Second, it provides a critique of the three methodological approaches which are available to researchers undertaking such studies and argues that most reported studies of boards are unreliable as they are based on only one, or at best two, of the three available sources of data.

In the aftermath of the corporate excesses of the 1980's, the performance of boards of directors has come under increased scrutiny. A number of professional and regulatory committees have addressed the issue of board performance and some have recommended that companies should appoint a board of directors having a majority of non-executive directors, with an appropriate mix of experience. In contrast, empirical evidence casts doubt on whether non-executive directors improve financial performance and suggests that the value of non-executive directors differs across companies. This study examines the composition of boards of directors and the personal characteristics of their non-executive directors, for a sample of eighty-six Australian listed public companies, and investigates whether these factors are associated with financial performance. Boards were found, on average, to have a majority (greater than 50%) of non-executive directors with a majority of those non-executive directors holding degrees. Non-executive directors were found to have varying amounts of firm, industry and other professional experience. Cross-sectional variation in board composition and non-executive directors' characteristics appears unrelated to differences in financial performance. (c) 1995, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The concept of pluralism in corporate governance is stated as an emergent theory. Grounded in the concept of enhancing the input of various stakeholders and lessening the control of managers in corporate governance, the theory is the foundation of proposed legal changes in corporate governance and the board of directors. While more pluralistic control has been conceptually linked to improved social performance of the firm, this proposition is not supported in an empirical investigation.

In this article, we review and evaluate recent management research on the effects of different types of diversity in group composition at various organizational levels (i.e., boards of directors, top management groups, and organizational task groups) for evidence of common patterns. We argue that diversity in the composition of organizational groups affects outcomes such as turnover and performance through its impact on affective, cognitive, communication, and symbolic processes.

Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Conceptualization and research have addressed the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of top management teams and, independently, the effectiveness of alternative corporate governance structures. Those studies which do concurrently consider directors and management focus largely on the board's monitoring of the CEO. The interdependencies which exist among chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors necessitate an integrative approach which simultaneously considers these groups of strategic leaders. In this paper, we provide a rationale whereby a firm might elect a CEO or board dominance structure as compared to more balanced governance structures. We suggest that the efficacy of such choices may depend on several attendant conditions including the portfolio exposure and globalization of the firm, its ownership patterns (e.g., five percent owners, institutional investors, positions held by other corporations), and resource dependence and information requirements.

Boards of directors of large American corporations are marked by a surprising degree of overlap in their memberships. The median Fortune 500 firm "interlocked" (shared directors) with seven other large firms during the mid-1980s, although this prevalence dropped slightly by the mid-1990s. In contrast to Japan, interlocks among American firms are rarely linked to banking relationships or vertical (buyer-supplier) relationships; rather, they reflect the embeddedness of corporate governance in social structures (e.g., friendship or other ties). Recent empirical research has linked interlocks to almost every important aspect of corporate governance, from executive compensation to strategies for takeovers and defending against takeovers. These findings suggest that proposals for reforming boards of directors through changing incentive structures (e.g., paying directors in equity rather than cash) are likely to have little effect because they misconstrue the role of the board as a social institution.

Recent research has suggested that effective monitoring may assist firms in preventing an eventual bankruptcy filing. Audit committees, board subgroups responsible for monitoring and evaluating the financial health of the firm, may exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in monitoring firms decline as a function of their composition. Another monitoring body which has become increasingly important in the corporate community is institutional investors. This study investigates the extent to which audit committee composition and institutional investor holdings are related to the incidence and nature (prepackaged plans and length of time spent in reorganization) of firms' bankruptcy filings. Results demonstrate no association between affiliated director representation on audit committees or institutional holdings and the incidence of bankruptcy. These two monitoring groups are, however, associated with the nature of bankruptcy filing. Both audit committee composition and the level of institutional holdings are significantly related to a prepackaged filing and the length of time spent in reorganization during the 5-year period preceding a bankruptcy filing.

The paper compares the contribution, power and influence of non-executive directors and part-time chairpersons within large UK PLC's, using interview data collected for a pilot study. Two questions are addressed: What contribution, if any, is made by non-executive directors and part-time chairmen? How, if at all, do part-time chairpersons exercise power and influence? The paper reveals that part-time chairmen and non-executive directors claim to contribute to a broad range of issues, ranging from the strategy of the firm, to the appointment, selection and dismissal of board members. Contribution is made by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors converting power sources into influence. A variety of influence methods are used by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors to contribute as board members. Part-time chairmen influence most by assertiveness, using the authority that comes with leading the board. Non-executive directors influence most through persuasion and coalition formation. Non-executive directors less on their positional authority to exert influence, and more on their personal knowledge, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to form relationships with individuals both inside and outside of the boardroom.

This paper presents a model of the basic components of the CEO selection decision process used by corporate boards of directors. It describes selection as a purposeful and boundedly rational process characterized by three key components: aspiration, judgment and justification. Each of these components is described in detail. In addition, the ordering of these elements is examined. Specifically, it is suggested that the exact ordering varies depending on a number of factors. Among the most important are (1) the performance of the organization, (2) the availability of qualified candidates and (3) the standardization of the CEO's office within the organization at the time of the succession decision. Examples are provided to help illustrate various order effects. Following this, sample research propositions are presented to assist researchers in future studies devoted to this topic.

This paper examines the factors influencing the relative weights placed on financial and non-financial performance measures in CEO bonus contracts. We find that the use of non-financial measures increases with the level of regulation, the extent to which the firm follows an innovation-oriented strategy, the adoption of strategic quality initiatives, and the noise in financial measures. We find no evidence that the choice of performance measures in bonus contracts is associated with the level of financial distress or the value of CEO equity holdings relative to salary and bonus. Our results also provide no support for the hypothesis that CEOs with greater influence over the board of directors are more likely to be compensated based on non-financial measures.

This paper examines stock price reactions to announcements of dual-class recapitalizations as they relate to characteristics of the board of directors. Our results show that certain board characteristics provide insight into directors' incentives. We differentiate characteristics of the board that are associated with management attempts to entrench its position and characteristics that may indicate an attempt to improve performance of the firm in the event of a takeover. We find that high levels of insider and affiliated outsider stock ownership, board tenure, and the presence of staggered board elections affect the stock market's reaction to these plans.

Takeover defense mechanisms have become common for many modern corporations. In this research, we examine one potential takeover defense mechanism, golden parachutes. In particular, the relationship between the board of directors (and the board committees) and the question of whether the parachutes are aligned with shareholder interests or are a means of entrenching management, is studied. Results show that the composition of the board of directors' compensation committee influences the market's perceived outcome of golden parachute adoption. When insiders and affiliated outsiders dominate the board's compensation committee, negative returns are more likely to occur than when independent outsiders control the committee.

Many corporate governance observers agree that when firms encounter dramatically changed competitive environments, the board of directors may become involved in the strategy formation process. Based on Finkelstein and Hambrick's (Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D., 1996. Strategic leadership: top executives and their effects on organizations. West, Minneapolis, MN.) conceptual model, we examine the effects of the board of directors and executive committee characteristics on the degree of internationalization of the U.S. telecommunications industry during the 12 years after AT&T's 1984 divestiture. We also examine the effects of the regulatory environment and core business growth on the degree on internationalization during this time. We find support linking executive committee characteristics and regulatory environment to the degree of internationalization. Characteristics of the entire board are consistently found to be insignificant. (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

Incentive or performance contingent compensation plans are rapidly becoming the norm in corporate America, as boards of directors attempt to make executives more accountable to shareholders. However, incentive plans also expose executives to risk, and may also impart a short-term bias on their decision-making processes. This article suggests that the tension between the pressures for accountability and long-term decision making can be managed by aligning firm strategy with an incentive plan that is based on an appropriate performance criteria.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper reports on the development of a questionnaire designed to measure the process aspects of the board as a working group. This initial study has been conducted among senior management teams due to the difficulty in gaining access to a sufficiently large sample of board teams at this development stage. The questionnaire was designed as one part of an investigation into standards of competence of boards of directors (Dulewicz et al. 1995; Institute of Directors, 1995). The questionnaire was distributed to the members of 54 "top teams". A factor analysis of the response identified 12 main dimensions of group process. Reliability measures of these dimensions, which proved to be acceptable, are also reported. Finally, results of correlations between these 12 measures and three measures of group performance, derived from the team performance questionnaire, showed that the 12 process measures are significantly related to performance, and so have some validity.

Postmodern assumptions employed by some organizational theorists recognize that "administrators' greater power lies not in their ability to control resources but in their ability to manipulate symbols - the ceremonies, rituals, images, and language of the organization" (Graham and David 9). Thus, even a genre that is often considered neutral and objective, such as meeting minutes, can become a tool of managerial control. This article presents data from an ethnographic case study that describes how an administrator in a theater organization manipulated language by using the minutes from a board of directors meeting to influence board members to vote to disband the organization.

Recounts the merger of Jerusalem's Neighbourhood Self Management Organizations (NSMOs) and Community Service Organizations (CSOs) into the Joint Community Neighbourhood Management Organization (JCNM). Refers to literature on institutional theory and the process of decentralization. Focuses then on the NSMOs and CSOs, providing some background information on how and why they were originally set up and what their goals were. Compares the differences between the organizations, as well as the basic principles they have in common - hence the merge into one organization. Discusses the problems the JCNM has faced over the years, including issues such as identify, legitimacy, composition of board of directors, professional or political values, and restructuring the organization. Draws a quadrant model of patronage and centralization, suggesting that the NCNM aims to occupy a particular quadrant but is being hampered in doing so because policy makers prefer to keep things the way they are.

We find that the presence of commercial bankers on the board is positively related to aggregate firm debt. Separating by type of debt, the presence of commercial bankers on the board is positively related to short-term, long-term, and total bank debt. We also find that while the presence of unaffiliated commercial bankers on the board is positively related to bank borrowing, the presence of affiliated commercial bankers on the board is not. The results are consistent with the theory that commercial bankers supply bank debt market expertise, but not with the theory that they sit on boards to monitor lending relationships.

An examination of 165 top management successions in U.S. firms during 1989-91 reveals that external successions are more likely in small firms, in firms with poor economic performance, and in firms which offer the successor several top positions (for example, Chairman and CEO). This last finding illustrates that successor's interests and demands (such as organizational power) are also important in determining the final match between manager and firm. We also find that, on average, the postsuccession performance of external successors is superior to that of internal successors. This could indicate that the Board of Directors faces an agency problem, leading it to appoint too often from inside.

Short-term performance increases that are sometimes observed after CEO successions may be evidence of self-interested behavior. New CEOs may cut allocations to long-term investment areas such as research and development (R&D), capital equipment and pension funds in an effort to drive up short-term profits and secure their positions. However, such actions have unfavorable consequences for some stakeholders. This study provides evidence that both R&D and pension funding are reduced subsequent to a succession, even after accounting for industry trends. The expected short-term profitability increases are also observed. A major implication of these results is that boards of directors and other interested parties should carefully monitor the actions of new CEOs with regard to their treatment of R&D and pension funding if they would like to prevent such actions from occurring. This study also highlights the need to investigate other potential self-interested behaviors of new CEOs.

In an open, unregulated and globalised economy, it is logical that the problem of corporate government not only occupy the time of academics, but also preoccupy both companies and the public administration. Corporate governance varies depending on several factors, such as the culture of a particular country, the economic situation and the organisational structures. Thus, there is no single recipe which can be applied automatically and is universally valid in all contexts. However, it is possible to propose some general principles which have duly stood the test of experience and are recognised as providing valuable guidance for efficient corporate governance. The aim of this article is to present the Spanish "Olivencia Report", which is an attempt to draft an "ethical code" containing a number of practices and principles, which, if they were to be applied, could improve the governance of the larger Spanish companies listed on the Stock Market. The pages which follow narrate the story of the making of the report, and highlight those features which distinguish this report from other analogous reports published in other countries, and which inspired the Olivencia Report. These reports, which include the "Cadbury Report", the "Vienot Report" and the "Peters Report" among others will also be dealt with. Once the more outstanding aspects of the Spanish report have been highlighted, the article closes with a brief concluding section, which goes beyond the case in question and stresses the relationship between ethics, corporate governance and the mission of the enterprise. This focus is of some importance as the literature on corporate governance rarely brings the ethical problem to the fore.

Most current work on Boards of Directors has been focused on what can be considered best practices for effective governance in terms of roles, composition, process and style. Furthermore, this literature can be divided among very practically oriented managerial work, and more rigorous, theoretically based work. Most of the empirical research in this area has been centered on Anglo-Saxon countries. Some European countries, like Spain, have a very different governance tradition. Given this context, our present work deals with two complementary objectives: 1. To ascertain the current status of governance practices in Spain. 2. To obtain evidence about which of these practices may be associated with effective governance.

We argue that Boards of Directors of Danish companies have been socially constructed as an important decision making body in the companies. Since 1974, employees have elected members to the Board of Directors. Today they can elect one third of the Board members. In spite of this new composition of the Board, it has emerged as a team that has been able to convince the stakeholders, the press, and the public about its important standing in the management of the company. To understand this development we look at four different perspectives. (1) The changing business environment that has framed the development: globalization, mergers and acquisitions, increased competition, technological innovations, strategic alliances, political consumers, and ethical issues are factors that have been the motor for this change. (2)We use a radical social psychological version of leadership theory (Meindl, 1993) to understand the social construction of the change of the role of the Board of Directors that has occurred. We argue that the stakeholders and the society at large have ascribed importance and leadership to the Board, and that it plays an important role as strategist in the companies. (3) We see the board as a theater ensemble staging a performance for the audience (stakeholders and the wider environment) using Erving Goffman's "Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" (1959) as a theoretical point of departure. From this point of view, the role of the Board is to socialize new members, to maintain its unity, and to successfully play the role of strategists. (4) To understand strategists you may understand the company and its environment in either realist terms (objective environments) or in social constructivist terms (enacted environments) (Smircich and Stubbart, 1985). We adopt the enactment position. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

One aspect of organizational governance is the power to propose issues for consideration in the formal decision process. Consortia composed of autonomous business organizations appear to be a good context for investigating this "proposal authority," because when a consortium is not too large it tends to be governed by a board of directors on which all the members are represented. This makes it possible to test hypotheses about the effects of the consortium's internal structure on the rules that govern who may propose issues for decision and how they may do so. We study here the formal rules, given in organizational charters and by-laws, for initiating specific types of decision in 53 consortia in the electric power industry in the USA. Hypotheses are developed from numerous theoretical perspectives, including the institutional, ecological, developmental, structuralist, resource-dependence, economic, and political-economic. We find a fair degree of heterogeneity in the practices of initiative control among these organizations, yet only the familiar structuralist theory is able to predict significantly the variation in these decision rules. This weak result poses interesting problems for future research.

The focus of this paper is to explore how contrasting ideologies influence the selection process of outside directors in the small family business. Small family businesses donot just represent smallscale economic activity but they are the outcome of entrepreneurial ambition and family involvement. This means that willpower and emotional commitment blend with calculative considerations. As emotional as well as cognitive constructs the family, management and entrepreneurship each represent an ideology: paternalism, managerialism and entrepreneurialism. The proposed ideological framework is positioned against alternative approaches to the study of board selection processes. Two sets of data are presented. A piloting survey of 12 family businesses is used to substantiate the theoretical assumption that entrepreneurial firms avoid having outside directors and managerial firms welcome outside directors, leaving paternalistically-run family businesses ambivalent. Repeated in-depth interviews in two family businesses, one founder-managed and entrepreneurial, the other established and traditional, reveal how the professionalization of the board enforces managerialism, challenging thus far dominating ideologies, entrepreneurialism and paternalism. The outcome of this ideological contest, if properly orchestrated, is an energized and more competitive family business. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper aims at reviewing research and presenting a research agenda on boards of directors in SMEs. While most publications about boards in SMEs focus on the lack of research in the area, this paper presents some of the work that has been conducted. Publications on boards of directors during the 1990s in outlets for SME research are reviewed. Boards of directors in small and medium-sized companies are getting increased attention, but the knowledge about boards in such companies is still fragmented. This paper presents research challenges based on a holistic model of directorates in SMEs that is elaborated from previous research about directorates. The papers selected for this special issue on boards of directors in SMEs are presented in this framework. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The coefficient of variation (V) is a statistical measure commonly used for comparing diversity in work groups. It has been employed by organizational researchers to index the relative internal variability of top-management teams, task groups, boards of directors, departments, and other social aggregates on numerous dimensions. Commenting on its widespread application, this article reviews cautions and pitfalls associated with its use for this purpose. Research implications associated with using V are also discussed.

Increased attention towards the role of the board makes demands on reforms in the boardroom. In many countries, even small and medium-sized firms are experiencing the challenges of creating well functioning boards. In this paper the authors examine the importance of structures and processes in the boardroom of 302 small and medium-sized industrial firms in Sweden. The contribution of the paper is not only that it tries to explore the relationship between processes in the board and board performance, but also that it pays attention to the working structures that exist to maximize the board's task performance. In this study board task performance is measured as the performance of various control and service roles. There are two main findings. (1) The board members' involvement, and (2) the board's formal structures are important for the board's ability to perform its tasks effectively. The findings empirically support the arguments about the importance of a good and clearly defined working style in the board. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Utilizing Rest's moral development and Victor and Cullen's ethical climate surveys, we examine differences in moral reasoning and ethical climate between board members in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. Six for-profit corporations and seven not-for-profit corporations, all with base operations in a major midwestern state, participated in the study. We find that profit and not-for-profit boards may not differ in moral reasoning, but do exhibit different types of ethical climates. We also find that for-profit board members may utilize higher stages of reasoning a greater percentage of the time than not-for-profit directors. In contrast, the ethical climates of the two types of organizations are significantly different. For-profit companies had climates higher in egoism than did not-for-profit companies. In addition, not-for-profit firms reflected higher benevolence factors than for-profit firms. Not-for-profit organizations also had somewhat higher, but not significantly different, mean scores on the principle factor compared to the for-profit organizations.

Managing the succession process by the hiring and firing of key executives is one of the important functions of a board of directors. In this research we study successions of fund managers in the closed-end mutual fund industry. The agency issues inherent in closed-end mutual funds makes them a unique laboratory for such a study. Our results suggest that while the overall abnormal returns of these manager changes are statistically insignificant, that the returns are more positive for funds with large expense ratios and for funds trading at a discount. We also find the abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of inside director stock ownership. Corporate bond funds and international equity funds react more negatively to these announcements than other types of funds. The abnormal returns do not appear to be related to board composition, but board composition does vary across fund type, and may therefore indirectly influence the results.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors are coming under increasing scrutiny, both in the wake of a number of serious corporate frauds and failures and through a more general debate about the nature of corporate governance and its role in achieving national competitiveness. Though research on boards is growing, there remains a lack of empirical studies on the perceptions of directors themselves as to their role and influence in the running of organizations, and in particular the strategic process. This article responds to widespread calls for direct study of boards of directors by using a multi-method approach involving an in-depth examination of 51 directors of UK public companies, a survey of 121 company secretaries and four case studies of UK plcs, where multiple board members were interviewed. Through the use of a grounded methodology, this article examines the impact of boards on strategy and shows that by establishing the business definition, gatekeeping, selecting directors, and confidence building, the board influences the boundaries of strategic action. Evidence for the managerial domination of boards was slight, but the results showed support for a number of theoretical frameworks, suggesting that multiple perspectives are required to fully understand the nature of board activity.

Relationships between corporate governance characteristics and financial distress status are examined for a sample of Canadian firms. Results from logit regression analysis of 46 financially distressed and 46 healthy firms lead us to conclude that the board of director's composition explains financial distress, beyond an exclusive reliance on financial indicators. Additionally, supplemental results indicate that outside directors' ownership and directorship affect the likelihood of financial distress. Furthermore, splitting financially distressed firms based on chief executive officer change as a proxy of turnaround strategies provides useful insights on corporate governance characteristics in financial distress.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The influence of corporate governance issues on the performance of a company has been discussed for some time, but only empirical evidence can convince people of the importance of these issues for the future. Moreover, the issues until now have largely been placed in an Anglo-Saxon business context, and make no reference to other models, such as continental European, that exist. In this paper, we analysed the composition of the board of directors in a sample of 122 Belgian companies and verified whether this composition has an impact on the performance of the firm, as measured by return on equity and assets. Through statistical calculations, we found evidence that board size and percentage of outside directors are positively related to company size and differ significantly across industries. We also found a significant positive relationship between the number of exeternal directors and return on equity, and where the functions of chairman and chief executive are combined, the return on assets is significantly higher.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

In this study, we investigate how board of directors' attributes influence CEO compensation among the firms comprising the TSE 150 index. Overall, results show that board of directors' attributes that are consistent with a political perspective determine a significant proportion of a CEO's various compensation components, more so in fact than variables such as firm size or performance.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

The paper provides an attempt to direct the research in the area of venture capitalists and the board of directors in SMEs. Issues about boards in venture capital-backed technology based industrials are explored, and various research designs are used to meet different research questions. Empirical results indicate that venture capital firms purposefully use boards in the portfolio firm, and boards in venture capital-backed firms are more active than boards in other firms. The venture capitalist and the entrepreneur/owner-manager of the portfolio firm may have diverging expectations to board roles. In this setting the board becomes an interesting meeting place for studying the processes and the dynamics between external and internal stakeholders. Future research in this area should integrate board role theories and board process theories. (c) 2002 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

This research examines the differences in presentation of boards of directors in annual reports. Our sample consists of 472 corporations from the Fortune 500; 130 (342) of these corporations included (did not include) pictures of their boards of directors. The proportion of female directors was 11.0 percent for firms that did not include pictures of their boards and 14.5 percent for firms that included pictures of their boards in their annual reports. The difference in the gender mix of these two groups is significant (p = 0.0002). This indicates that firms with a higher percentage of women on their boards signal this fact to stockholders, investors, and other constituents by including pictures of their boards in their annual reports.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

The representation of women in organizations has become an increasingly important topic for academics and practitioners. Despite the growing presence of women in the workforce, representation of women in corporate governance is relatively low. The present study examined the gender composition of corporate boards as a function of organization size and industry. Data from government filings were collected for the top 100 public companies in a suburban region of the USA. Results indicated a positive relationship between organization size and women on boards. Partial support was found for hypotheses related to industry. Practical implications and areas for future study are discussed. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

While critical accounting research has long been vitally interested in relationships between accounting, auditing and control of business organizations, mainstream research in accounting, finance and management has only recently displayed an increased interest in questions of corporate governance. The notion of corporate governance typically employed in mainstream research focus on enhancing benefits to shareholders. The structure and the functioning of boards of directors, and audit committees of such boards, are primary concerns within this line of research. This paper presents an alternative view of corporate governance and the role of auditing within corporate governance. We argue that the role of auditing should be increased in order to enhance the control of corporations for the benefit of all stakeholders and society generally. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Boards of directors serve two important functions for organizations: monitoring management on behalf of shareholders and providing resources. Agency theorists assert that effective monitoring is a function of a board's incentives, whereas resource dependence theorists contend that the provision of resources is a function of board capital. We combine the two perspectives and argue that board capital affects both board monitoring and the provision of resources and that board incentives moderate these relationships.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

In this paper, we extend the work of Ang et al. [J. Finance 55 (1999) 81] to large firms. We find that managerial ownership is positively related to asset utilization but does not serve as a significant deterrent to excessive discretionary expenses. Outside block ownership may only have a limited effect on reducing agency costs. Furthermore, smaller boards serve the same role, but independent outsiders on a board do not appear to protect the firm from agency costs. Thus, this paper reports complementary evidence to Ang, Cole and Lin. In large publicly traded corporations, managerial ownership significantly alleviates principal-agent conflicts even in the presence of other agency deterrent mechanisms.

This paper explores the performance impact of recent changes in foreign shareholdings and boardroom reforms in Japan. Empirical research on the impact of reform on the Japanese corporate governance system could provide useful lessons for their European counterparts who are themselves facing similar pressures to reform. We found that although participation of outside directors in strategic decision-making was associated with positive stock returns, the increase in the ratio of outside directors, the separation of the board members and executive officers, and the reduction of board size were not related to firm performance.

In France the chairperson of the board is most often the firm's CEO. This position strengthens the insiders' hold on the board of directors. Moreover, a large fraction of outside directors is composed of CEOs of other firms. The reciprocal interlocking of CEOs creates the possibility of mutual interdependence of CEOs. We investigate factors explaining reciprocal interlocking directorates of CEOs in French corporations. Our results indicate that CEOs of larger firms hold more reciprocal CEO interlocks and when CEOs have more outside directorships, CEOs hold more reciprocal relationships. We also find a positive relationship between the number of CEOs reciprocal interlocks and their firms' performance measured by ROA. We find evidence that CEOs hold more reciprocal interlocks when a blockholder is present on the CEO's board.

The theory of market and government failure can be used to diagnose inefficiency within firms and to identify strategies to deal with these problems. Internal market failures (IMFs) - internal public good problems, internal negative and positive externalities, internal information asymmetries, internal monopolies, the presence of uncertainty - create inefficiencies within firms just as they do in normal markets. As well, self-interested behaviour by executives and internal interest groups (rent-seeking) are analogous to government, or governance, failures (IGFs). Associated with many of these internal market failure problems are generic solutions that can usefully inform executives in their efforts to improve efficiency within the firm. Internal governance failures, in contrast, normally require action by shareholders and boards of directors. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Most of studies on corporate governance are based on the Anglo-Saxon view. However in France the majority of the top managers graduate from Ena and Polytechnic. Belonging to one or the other of these two clans, with the underlying link to the civil service, can have serious repercussions on the system of corporate governance. The clan tries to increase their power in the firms. In order to do this, it needs to control firms' leaders, but also the board of directors. The control of the board allows the system to master all shareholders' objections. It is also a means to widen its influence. This study proposes an analysis of the links between the characteristics of leaders and boards as well as the consequences of this control of the clan on the performance of the firm.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.

This study examines the relationship between top management team duality and the decision to release false financial information. Using a matched sample of 103 firms that were convicted of issuing fraudulent financial statements in the period from 1992 to 1996, the results show that this form of illegal corporate behavior is more likely to occur when there is a concentration of power in the hands of insiders. For these firms, insiders control the top management team and the Board of Directors by simultaneously occupying the key managerial positions of clout within the firm while also sitting on the Board (duality), and through their ownership interest in the firm.

The influence of corporate governance on firm performance has been discussed for a number of years, but mainly in a United States and European business context. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in large Australian firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance, as measured by return on equity and markct-to-book value ratio. The results showed that outsider ratio and female director ratio were positively associated with firm performance, whereas board size and directors' age had no influence on firm performance.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

The purpose of this article is to investigate how ownership structure, especially family and/or venture-capital involvement, as well as entrepreneurial activities, defined as strategic change and renewal, help explain the involvement of independent members on boards of directors. The CEOs of 2,455 small and medium-sized, private enterprises from practically all industries were contacted in a telephone survey, resulting in an exceptionally high response rate. The findings reveal that family firms are more reluctant to involve independent directors on their boards than non-family firms, that presence of venture capitalists increases the frequency of independent board members and that ownership has an impact on board roles. The results do not support the hypothesised relationship that independent directors enhance entrepreneurial activities. One implication of our study is that the often-argued-for strategic contribution of outsiders to the boards in family firms may be overemphasised. Another implication is that family firms that choose to acquire additional capital should be aware that this could result in a change in the board composition and the loss of control of the business. However, new and external owners' inclusion on the board seems to be negotiable since there are also venture capitalists that do not insist on board representation.

The size, characteristics and structure of boards of directors have been claimed to be an important influence on the performance of large firms, but have been less examined in small firms. For larger firms the role of boards acts more as a substitute for the development of internal staff and management skills, indicating that for large firms directors chiefly support the control role of CEOs. The importance of seeing boards, external consultants and internal management skills as substitutes is demonstrated, and is shown to have a non-linear relation with firm size. However, a key finding of the paper is that there is little evidence of a strong association of board size, board qualifications, or board structure with firm performance, measured by profitability, employment growth or propensity to innovate.

Recent research focuses on explaining the diversification discount. However, there is little direct evidence regarding the relation among ownership structure, corporate governance, and corporate diversification. The results in this paper suggest that agency issues do not account for firms adopting a particular diversification strategy. Also, the performance consequences of the shift in the diversification strategy and the subsequent changes in institutional and block ownership structures are not related to agency issues. In fact, investors seem not to avoid diversified firms per se. We suggest that observed board and ownership differences between diversified and focused firms are due to their being at different stages of corporate evolution. (c) 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

There is growing interest in corporate values but where do they come from? What factors determine corporate values? This paper argues that they are determined by corporate governance in a broad sense of the word. Three governance mechanisms are emphasized: ownership structure, board composition and stakeholder influence. In smaller companies founder-owners often play a pivotal role in shaping corporate value systems that influence companies for years to come. In larger companies that separate ownership and control, managers and boards come to play a powerful role. In both cases repeated interaction with customers, employees and other stakeholders shape corporate values by way of corporate reputation and corporate culture.

This paper examines the issue of independence of boards of directors and non-executive directors of companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. Based on information published in annual reports, the study found that most Irish listed companies were complying with the Combined Code's recommendations for a balanced board structure, albeit with only 60 per cent having majority-independent boards. The study found a lack of consistency in interpreting the definition of "independence", a lack of disclosure of information and, by applying criteria generally regarded as prerequisite to independence of non-executive directors, certain situations which imposed upon their independence.

We compare turnover of subsidiary managers inside conglomerate firms to turnover of CEOs of comparable stand-alone firms. We find that, compared to turnover of CEOs, subsidiary manager turnover is significantly more sensitive to changes in performance and significantly more likely following poor performance. For subsidiary managers, the relation between turnover and performance is significantly stronger when the subsidiary operates in an industry that is related to the parent's primary industry. Results suggest that boards of directors are relatively ineffective disciplinarians of CEOs and despite their other apparent failings, conglomerate firms have relatively strict disciplining mechanisms for subsidiary managers.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

This study strives to take an extra step to sharpen the comprehension of one aspect of agency theory as well as to extend previous research by examining the role of board of directors and managerial remuneration in enhancing corporate performance in the REITs industry. The main hypothesis in this study will be twofold. First, managerial remuneration is related to corporate performance. Second, the ratio of outside directors is related to corporate performance. This study will use a sample of REIT firms as of the end of 1996. The sample will consist of the actively traded REITs listed in the public stock exchanges. The final sample that meets all the criteria includes 167 REITs. The results indicate that there is a negative relationship between cash managerial remuneration and firm performance. Moreover, this study confirms a nonlinear relationship between board size and firm performance. The relationship is negative when board size is small, and it turns positive when board size grows.

The debate over Corporate Governance has been gathering pace in France for several years. Most of the studies on this topic are based on the Anglo-Saxon view. It should nevertheless be noted that French capitalism has peculiarities, which have their origin in its methods of Corporate Governance. Carminatti-Marchand and Paquerot [2000] underline the specificities of the principles of Corporate Governance in France. An essential aspect of this is the nature of the leaders of major companies: more than 50% of the bigger French firms CEOs are graduated from Polytechnic Institute (familiarly referred to as "X") and of ENA (Ecole Nationale d'Administration). Since 1995, however, the economic and financial environment of French companies has changed considerably. We note today the omnipresence of foreign investors on the Paris Stock Exchange. That presence alters the rules of Corporate Governance and gives us reason to believe that a movement of convergence towards the directors and managers who are graduates of ENA and/or Polytechnic? The results of the study reveal significant losses of posts for graduates of X and ENA in the management structures of large French companies between 1995 and 1999.

We develop theoretical arguments from the efficiency wage model (Shapiro & Stiglitz, 1984) to provide better understanding of Fama's (1980) seminal notion that executive labor markets contribute to the alignment of executive and shareholder interests. We show how the efficiency wage model can be integrated with several other theories of executive turnover. Furthermore, the model allows for predictions that have received very little analysis to date, such as the effect of firm risk and executive salaries on turnover. We test predictions from the model on a sample of executives from 280 manufacturing firms observed annually from 1986 to 1992. Our sample includes data on over 12,000 observations and nearly 1,700 employment terminations. The results are consistent with the main predictions of the efficiency wage model. Holding performance constant, boards of directors are less patient with (more likely to dismiss) executives who have lower salaries and those in higher risk firms. (c) 2004 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

Resource dependence theory emphasizes the importance of linking firms with external contingencies that create uncertainty and interdependence. A critical source of external interdependency and uncertainty for business is government. One way to link a firm to the government is appointing ex-politicians to the board of directors. This study compares the boards of two groups of firms - those from heavily and less regulated industries - and finds the former group has more politician directors. Firms with politicians on the board are associated with better market-based performance across both groups, although the relationship is more pronounced within heavily regulated industries.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

This paper examines the role of boards of directors in light of institutional contingencies and recent best practice governance guidelines and regulation such as the United Kingdom Higgs Review and the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. Particular attention is paid to discussing the role of independent directors across countries, and the implications for corporate governance innovation. It concludes by posing questions about recent corporate governance transformations and providing suggestions for future research. (c) 2005 British Academy of Management.

The reciprocal interlocking of chief executive officers is a non-trivial phenomenon: among large companies in 1991, about one company in seven was in a relationship whereby the CEO of one company sat on a second company's board and the second company's CEO sat on the first company's board. We develop hypotheses to distinguish whether this practice furthers the interests of shareholders or the private interests of the CEOs. Using a sample of large companies, we employ a probit model to test these hypotheses. Our empirical findings are that these reciprocal CEO interlocks primarily benefit the CEOs rather than their shareholders. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the effects of board of directors' network characteristics on firm performance using a sample of 199 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1990 through 1999. Two board network characteristics are discussed, namely: board network density and board external social capital. Board network density is defined as the extensiveness or the cohesiveness of contact among the members of board of directors, and board external social capital refers to the degree to which board members have outside contacts in the external environment. The test results suggest that a moderate level of board network density enhances firm value, while too cohesive a board network destroys it. It is also found that board members' elite school networks were positively associated with firm performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

Past literature in board research has centred on board structure and company performance. Over the years, empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between these two variables (Dalton and Daily, 1999. Across the Board, March, 28-32). Until recently, the literature on board processes has been sparse. The reason for insufficient empirical work on board processes possibly is due to the difficulty of gaining access to boards. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model and tested the model on publicly listed companies in Singapore. Based on a sample of 212 company responses and 299 directors, we conclude that board structure does not affect board process while board process is related to board performance. In terms of individual parameters, effort norms, cognitive conflict and the presence and usage of skills are positively related to board roles and board transparency. Also, affective and process conflicts are negatively related to board roles and board transparency. Finally, board process does not mediate the relationship between board structure and board performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This article explores the structure of the Italian capitalist system by focusing on the relationships between financial firms - banks, insurance and holding companies - and industrial companies in Italy during the period 1952-72 through the analysis of the interlocks that existed between them. By an interlock is meant the link created between two firms when an individual belongs to the board of directors of both. The analysis is based on a database - Imita.db - containing data on over 30,000 directors of Italian joint-stock companies for the years 1952, 1960 and 1972. After a descriptive statistical overview of the companies and the directors included in the database, the article develops a network connectivity analysis of the system. This is integrated with a prosopographic study of the big linkers, defined as those directors cumulating the highest number of offices in each benchmark year. The article confirms that Italian capitalism maintained substantial peculiarities in the period investigated. In particular, it argues that interlocks played an important role in guaranteeing the stability of the positions of control of the major private companies and their connections with state-owned enterprises. In 1952 and 1960 the system, centred on the larger electrical companies, showed the highest degree of cohesion. That centre dissolved after nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1962 and was replaced by a less strong and cohesive one, hinged on banks, insurance and the major finance companies.

The board of directors plays an important role in solving the agency problem between shareholders and management. This paper investigates the relationships between ownership and board structure with the diversification strategy of large Japanese firms. The results show that corporate nominee directors are associated with lower levels of product diversification of their investee firms. This suggests that nominee directors in large Japanese corporations see themselves representing specific interests and therefore investors should pay attention to board composition in order to assess the level of protection they can expect to receive. Even without any apparent agency problem with management, there remains a potential "principal- principal" problem. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

We provide evidence on the relation between board structure and CEO compensation in public sector corporations in New Zealand. Using a sample of 80 New Zealand public sector companies, we find that similar to private sector studies, CEO compensation is related to board size, whether the CEO sits on the board, and director quality. We also find that a composite measure of board structure is significant. We conclude that, similar to the private sector, board structure is important in constraining CEO pay. Moreover, our results suggest that private sector-style board can be effective in a public sector context. (c) 2005, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Embedded within firms are unique stores of intangible human assets that likely influence the way firms compete. We argue that the human and social capital of a firm, particularly at the upper echelon and board of director (BOD) levels, contribute to the firm's awareness of the competitive environment and its motivation and ability to undertake numerous, complex, and forceful competitive actions. We also suggest that the firm's executive compensation systems moderate the effects of these intangible human assets on firm competitive behavior. By examining how human capital, intra-firm social capital, and executive compensation influence firm competitive behavior, we advance a strategic HRM perspective of firm competitive behavior and outline several implications for future research.

Traditionally, corporate governance has focused on the problem of crafting mechanisms to align the interests of owners and managers. The key characteristic has been to minimize the potential for managers to act in their own self-interest at the expense of shareholders. The purpose of this paper is to focus on employees as stakeholders in the governance process. We argue that creating an environment where employees have help in behaving ethically, in the course of their work, is the first step in encouraging them to voice observations of wrongdoing. Seven groups of professionals in the accounting and insurance fields were surveyed during a 10-year period and asked to indicate the extent to which 14 items were helpful in dealing with ethical challenges. Over 2700 responses were analyzed. The findings indicate that professionals think that their organizational culture and policy for voice was more helpful in dealing with ethical dilemmas than was their professional association.

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been the subject of academic research from a variety of perspectives. However, the question of whether and how MNEs differ from local businesses in terms of their corporate governance mechanisms concerning the way they are directed and controlled by the board of directors is still largely unexplored. This question must be answered before researchers, policy makers and managers can identify action areas to improve governance and accountability in MNEs. In this paper, we empirically analyze the structures, systems and effectiveness of evaluation processes relating to the board of directors in MNEs and local companies in Turkey, an emerging country. We identify the significant differences on various key aspects of corporate governance among the groups, explore reasons to explain these differences and draw implications for further study of corporate governance in MNEs. A conceptual model is presented where institutional and organizational factors leading to governance differences are linked to how MNEs configure their boards in a host country setting.

Purpose - This paper aims to test the impact of corporate governance structure on corporate values. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs factor analysis and three-stage least squares to identify and explain variance in corporate values. Findings - In accordance with the proposed theoretical framework ownership, board and stakeholder structure are found to influence corporate values. When value determinants are taken into account there is no significant relationship between values and profitability. Research limitations/implications - This is a pilot study of 71 Danish firms. Further research needs to address measurement of corporate values and to test hypotheses on larger datasets. Practical implications - One practical implication is that corporate values should be grounded in the company's ownership, board and stakeholder structure. Real changes in corporate values may require real changes in governance structure. Originality/value - The paper tests a new approach to the study of corporate values which connects values to governance. It thereby establishes empirical foundations for current discussions about corporate values. This should be important both to practical work on company missions, values and responsibilities and to academics who search for an operational approach to the study of corporate values.

Cannella and Holcomb ((this volume). In: F. Dansereau & F. J. Yammarino (Eds), Research in multi-level issues (Vol. 4). Oxford, UK: Elsevier Science) are unconvinced that top management teams (TMTs) are the appropriate level of analysis for upper echelons research and are, accordingly, unenthusiastic about the promise of multi-level analysis for research of this type. We agree and discuss (1) the fragility of agency theory as it pertains to TMT research, (2) various issues pertaining to TMT turnover (or lack thereof), (3) paradoxes in practice and theory regarding TMT homogeneity/heterogeneity, (4) the absence of boards of directors in the upper echelons perspective, and (5) the implications of these issues on the theory/conceptualization of TMTs and of the research dedicated to them. We question whether the variables, as currently configured, relied on in this literature are sufficiently developed to adequately test an upper echelons perspective, or to sensibly warrant a multi-level analytical approach.

Existing research on the effects of boards of directors on firm performance has failed to produce consistent empirical results. In the research presented, I argue that this may be due to the fact that such research has largely ignored the interactions that take place on a board and that serve as an enabling mechanism for the board to be able to contribute to firm performance. I introduce the concept of 'board capability', which allows scholars to consider a board's composition, structure and interactions simultaneously. Also, the results of two empirical studies of boards in adolescent companies are presented. Taken together, these studies support the theoretical argument for the importance of board interactions and shed light on the performance effects of boards in adolescent companies.

Our study empirically examines the association between four board of director characteristics and two audit committee dimensions. The audit committee dimensions are the level to which Singapore publicly listed firms voluntarily (1) include more independent directors on their audit committee beyond the mandatory minimum majority of independent directors and (2) improve the collective knowledge and experience of this standing committee by including suitably qualified independent directors. Our analysis is based on hand collected data from 430 domestically incorporated firms listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) at the end of 2003. We find Singapore publicly traded firms are likely to voluntarily include more independent directors on their audit committees beyond the mandated minimum majority when (1) the size of the board of directors increases, (2) firms segregate the positions of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairperson of the board, and (3) the proportion of independent directors serving on the board of directors increases. The percentage of independent directors with directorate interlocks appears not to influence a firm's decision to voluntarily include more independent directors on their audit committees. We also find a statistically significant association between (1) duality (negative) and (2) percentage of independent directors with directorate interlocks (positive) and propensity for Singapore firms to voluntarily increase the collective knowledge and experience of the audit committee's independent directors. Contrary to expectations board size and the proportion of independent directors are not significant determinants.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempts to find a relationship between boards of directors and firm performance. This paper critically examines the premise on which this research is based. An expectations gap approach is applied for the first time to implicit expectations which assume a relationship between firm performance and company boards. An expectations gap has two elements: a reasonableness gap and a performance gap. Seven aspects of boards are identified as leading to a reasonableness gap. Five aspects of boards are identified as leading to a performance gap. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for empirically testing some of the concepts discussed in this paper.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

Purpose - There has been increasing interest in Australia regarding corporate boards, their role and the contribution they make to organisations' performance and success. There is however, a gap in our knowledge about what board members do. To better understand boards, we need to know more about the behaviour of those who sit on boards. Many chairmen and all non-executive directors serve on corporate boards in a part-time capacity, however, such part-time service does not negate a role in strategy. The purpose of this paper is to ask how, if at all, do part-time board members influence strategy in Australian public companies? Design/methodology/approach - This paper first examines the literature on choice, change and control as key aspects of firms' strategic conduct. Second, attention turns to generating empirical data to examine how part-time board members engage with these processes. Attention is given to the actions of part-time board members vis-a-vis executive directors, both inside and outside the boardroom. Data from interviews with 20 board members are interpreted using the 1999 framework of McNulty and Pettigrew which conceptualises part-time board members' involvement in strategy as: "taking strategic decisions", "shaping strategic decisions" and "shaping the content, context and conduct of strategy". Findings - Each of the three levels of part-time board member involvement in strategy described by McNulty and Pettigrew engage part-time board members in processes of choice, change and control in differing ways. Part-time board members are able to shape both the ideas that form the content of corporations' strategies and the methodologies and processes by which those ideas evolve. In so doing, part-time board members are capable of exerting control over management and influencing processes of strategic choice and change. Boards of directors have a role in strategy formulation, strategic decision-making and strategic control. Practical implications - The board's role is in the driver's seat not as a rubber stamp. A process whereby board members can engage and exert a controlling influence over strategic direction and outcomes of the corporation is of benefit not only to Australian corporations but has global corporate benefit. Originality/value - This paper describes and analyzes the contribution to strategy made by board members in five Australian companies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Past research examining the influence of boards of directors on firm performance has acknowledged, but typically failed to account for, the early life cycle stage of the firm. This study analyzes the effectiveness of board structure and behavior on firm performance in the early stages of the life-cycle for start-up IPO firms. Results suggest that the life-cycle of the firm is an important contextual variable to include when determining board effectiveness.

This paper looks at information asymmetry at the board level and how lack of information has played a part in undermining the power of the board of directors. Information is power, and at board level, information is essential to keep the board knowledgeable about the failures and successes of the organization that it is supposed to govern. Although lack of information has become a popular excuse for boards, the mantra could -and should -be changing to, "Ignorance is no excuse" (Mueller, 1993). This paper explores some of these information system solutions that have the aim of resolving some of the problems of information asymmetry. Furthermore, three case studies are used to explore the problem of asymmetric information at board level and the how the boards are trying to solve the problem. The focus of the discussion is to a) describe how directors experience the information asymmetry and if they find it troublesome, b) how important information is for the control and strategy role of the board and c) find out how boards can minimize the problem of asymmetric information. The research is conducted through semi-structured interviews with directors, managers and accountants. This paper offers an interesting exploration into information, or the lack of information, at board level. It describes both from a theoretical and practical viewpoint the problem of information asymmetry at board level and how companies are trying to solve this problem. It is an issue that has only been lightly touched upon in the corporate governance literature but is likely to attract more attention and research in the future.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This paper seeks to argue that boards can be playing a more proactive role in contributing to organizational effectiveness and that their composition requires greater research attention. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, the paper empirically examines the relationship between key board composition variables and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - At this stage in the development of the approach, the focus is on a sub-set of the elements proposed in the group dynamics literature. The population for this study comprises all companies included in the Canadian TSE 300 Composite Index (renamed the S&P/TSX Composite Index). This study uses cross-sectional regression analyses to examine the nature of the relationships between board composition and firm performance. Findings - The data analyses revealed that high levels of experience, appropriate team size, moderate levels of variation in age and team tenure were correlated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Boards of directors (BOD) are teams whose effectiveness can be assessed through group dynamic constructs in the organizational behaviour literature. Further research is needed to examine the intricate dynamics that might moderate or mediate the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. Practical implications - The findings provide a much-needed benchmark to consider whether the composition of boards is optimal, given the functions and mandate. In addition, the study highlights the opportunity costs of boards, restricting their roles to agency issues. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper tests some of the many variables that can be extrapolated from the group dynamics research. The paper calls on boards to examine what BOD functionality really entails, and argues for more proactive behaviours aimed at strategic firm issues. (c) 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Research suggests that a strong and vigilant board can have a significant influence on the value-creating potential of medium-size companies. Yet, how best to conceptualize this relationship remains controversial.The mainstream approach has been to argue for a direct relationship between board demography and company performance. In opposition stands a growing number of scholars who argue that boards' ability to perform board tasks effectively - their actual behaviour - should be taken into account. Empirical studies comparing the two approaches are however surprisingly scarce. Based on this observation, the aim of the study is to test the influence of boards of directors on CEOs' commitment to take an entrepreneurial posture. Both demographic and behavioural board measures are included in the model. Statistical analysis on a sample of 175 medium-size manufacturing companies gives ample support for the behavioural approach. The study ends with a discussion of the results and suggestions for further research. (c) SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

This study analyses the relationship between ownership structure and board of director composition and their influences on the total factor productivity (TFP) of Taiwan's firms. The empirical results show that the curvilinear specification is better to capture the relationship between inside ownership and firm productivity. Meanwhile, the ownership structure in a firm indeed affects differences in TFP between conglomerate firms and non-conglomerate firms, high-tech firms and non-high-tech firms, and family-owned firms and non-family-owned firms. Additionally, a smaller board may be less encumbered by bureaucratic problems and more functional and CEO duality may be able to improve productivity. Furthermore, productivity deteriorates with increasing proportion of collateralised shares. More institutional holdings, however, are an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of collateralised shares on TFP. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

This article explores the relationship between the human resource management function's access to avenues of political influence and perceived organizational performance. We examine responses from 441 Australian senior HRM managers who participated in an online survey of a national HRM professional association. Drawing from political influence theory, we develop a model and related hypotheses to investigate the impact of opportunities for the HRM function to manage and control the shared meaning of HRM on perceived organizational performance. Although there was no evidence of a moderating effect of avenues of HRM political influence, CEO support and organizational support for HRM predicted perceived organizational performance. HRM representation on the board of directors appears to serve a symbolic function only. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in response to the identified importance of CEO and organizational support. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The historiographies of Mexico and Brazil have implicitly stated that business networks were crucial for the initial industrialization of these two countries. Recently, differing visions on the importance of business networks have arisen. In the case of Mexico, the literature argues that entrepreneurs relied heavily on an informal institutional structure to obtain necessary resources and information. In contrast, the recent historiography of Brazil suggests that after 1890 the network of corporate relations became less important for entrepreneurs trying to obtain capital and concessions, once the institutions promoted financial markets and easy entry for new businesses. Did entrepreneurs in Brazil and Mexico organize their networks differently to deal with the different institutional settings? We examine whether in Mexico businessmen relied more on networks of interlocking boards of directors and other informal arrangements to do business than in Brazil. Our hypothesis is confirmed by three related results: (1) the total number of connections (i.e., the density of the network) was higher in Mexico than Brazil; (2) in Mexico, there was one dense core network, while in Brazil we find fairly dispersed clusters of corporate board interlocks; and most importantly, (3) politicians played a more important role in the Mexican network of corporate directors than their counterparts in Brazil. Interestingly, even though Brazil and Mexico relied on very different institutional structures, both countries had similar rates of growth between 1890 and 1913. However, the dense and exclusive Mexican network might have ended up increasing the social and political tensions that led to the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920).

This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the gender composition and structure of the board of directors in not-for-profit organisations and their relation to firm-level entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey sent to Swedish riding schools. The paper focuses on not-for-profit associations and the analysis is based on 60 respondents. The data were analysed by multivariate methods. Findings The overall gender composition of boards had no influence on firm-level entrepreneurship. However, a high proportion of women in powerful positions were found to have a positive influence on one of the study's two dimensions of firm-level entrepreneurship, i.e. strategic opportunism. No influence concerning gender in powerful positions was found on risk taking, the other dimension of firm-level entrepreneurship. Originality/value The attention to gender composition not only focuses on the board at large, but also highlights the specific positions of the chairperson, secretary and treasurer in the board structure. Another valuable insight concerns firm-level entrepreneurship, here treated as a two-dimensional concept, consisting of strategic opportunism and risk taking, which finds support in the analysis. Further, the empirical data were collected from an industry that includes a high proportion of women on the boards, i.e. the Swedish riding school industry. The study contributes to the debate concerning the gender composition on the board of directors where a high proportion of women in powerful positions is positively related with strategic opportunism.

Moves by regulators to drive governance reform have cascaded across the globe. The U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the U.K. Combined Code are leading examples. The article discusses how boards can contribute to strategic conversations and share responsibilities for strategic management with the CEO and top teams. We discuss how tools like balanced scorecards can align the focus of directors towards future opportunities and risks. It is suggested that boards adopt a strategic scorecard as implemented by CIMA1Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.1 to engage in strategy. This holistic framework provides a common language and structure for top-level decision-making and leads to enhanced performance for stakeholders. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the Combined Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, 2006) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of PLC board members, current academic literature offers little guidance to FTSE 250 boards - many of whom are managing different Issues compared with their FTSE 100 counterparts including high corporate growth, existing founder and/or family board members, and/or newly formed boards - on ways In which they can improve the quality of decision-making, increase individual board contribution, and enhance overall board performance and effectiveness. This paper attempts to outline the key issues faced by board members, particularly non-executive directors, serving on FTSE 250 company boards with regard to three distinct roles-strategy, succession planning and risk management - and examines the relevant influences on board members derived from corporate lifecycle, board structure, existing process and board culture which affect board performance and standards of corporate governance. Its conclusions draw on the author's previous research on non-executive contribution (Long, 2004) and her recent experience of reviewing performance and effectiveness of FTSE 100 and 250 boards of directors through Boardroom Review.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

This qualitative study explored the learning experiences of twelve national nonprofit membership association CEOs using a phenomenological research design. While the professional context of an organization's chief executive is considered unique from other executive positions, the impact of this context on what and how CEOs learned was unclear. The findings describe association CEO learning as being affected in significant ways by the politically charged context in which the nonprofit association CEO operates with his or her board of directors. Power imbalances with staff and the board make learning through traditional organizational dialogue a less useful learning process for the CEOs. Furthermore, the feelings of isolation and vulnerability that are generated from the nonprofit association CEO context often cause CEOs to use private reflection and dialogue with their spouse as primary learning mechanisms. The study concludes that the association CEO context uniquely and profoundly shapes what, how, and why CEOs learn. Perhaps lacking the financial security of lucrative severance payments, which are often specified in employment contracts of for-profit CEOs, the nonprofit association CEO will often temper his or her actions to avoid personal vulnerability with a politically charged board of directors.

Following the publication of the Spanish Code of Corporate Good Governance in 1998 (known as the Olivencia Code), some companies voluntarily created audit committees in line with the recommendation that all firms, and especially listed companies, should do so. The aim of this work is to analyse the factors associated with voluntary audit committee formation in companies listed on the Spanish Capital Market through 1999. In particular we analyse factors such as board independence and size, the board chairman/CEO duality, auditor size, agency costs, ownership, economies of scale, institutional investors, the audit report and auditor tenure. We find that voluntary audit committee formation is positively correlated with the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors and economies of scale, while the evidence reveals a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between board size and voluntary audit committee formation. We also formed another sample excluding financial institutions, for which we found that audit committee formation is positively associated with board independence and economies of scale, and negatively associated with the audit report and audit tenure.

The authors argue that the widespread treatment of human capital development in the frames of the internal context of the organisation is too restrictive. Proceeding from the treatment of corporate governance, the authors set up the hypothesis that human capital development in the organisation starts from the owners (supervisory board, board of directors). The purpose of the article is to show the owner's possible influence on human capital development in the organisation. The authors present one possible scheme of ties in the owners' influence on development of human capital in the organisation (choosing the top manager, drafting of strategy, direct interference with the organisation's staff issues, perception of corporate social responsibility, etc.). The results from the in-depth interviews (undertaken in 2004) with Estonian owners and top managers are used to support the authors' standpoint about the significant role of the owner in the development of human capital.

We analyze how directors with financial expertise affect corporate decisions. Using a novel panel data set, we find that financial experts exert significant influence, though not necessarily in the interest of shareholders. When commercial bankers join boards, external funding increases and investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases. However, the increased financing flows to firms with good credit but poor investment opportunities. Similarly, investment bankers on boards are associated with larger bond issues but worse acquisitions. We find little evidence that financial experts affect compensation policy. The results suggest that increasing financial expertise on boards may not benefit shareholders if conflicting interests (e.g., bank profits) are neglected. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate governance practices of small cap companies have had on their financial performances. Previous studies have mainly examined governance practices of larger corporations. This analysis focuses on the governance variables that have been highlighted by the New Zealand Securities Commission (2004) governance principles and guidelines and also on the governance variables that are supported in the literature as providing an appropriate structure for the firm in the environment in which it operates. The data for 71 small cap companies listed in New Zealand over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005 was analysed. Pooled data, OLS and 2SLS regression techniques were used and Tobin's Q, ROA and OPINC were used as the dependent variables. The evidence does support the hypothesis that the existence of board independence and audit committee has enhanced firm financial performance, as measured by Tobin's Q.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Purpose - Past literature on board research has centred on board structure and firm performance. Since empirical studies do not reveal a conclusive relationship between the two, attention has shifted towards board role performance. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper examines three conceptual models for the studying of board role performance: structure, process, and mediation. Findings - Current literature provides little consensus as to the specific configuration for effective board role performance. Originality/value - First, the study examines various aspects of board role performance. This is in contrast with previous research which largely investigates board role performance in general or under the dominant agency perspective which emphasises the board's monitoring role. Second, unlike traditional governance models, the role of board process is explicitly advocated here. Third, the three conceptual models regarding the relationship among board structure, process and performance give an alternative avenue for researchers to explain inconsistencies in past board research. They complement the growing interest in opening up the "black-box" of decision making that has been manifested in studies involving top management teams. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the potential role and the measurement of the effectiveness of boards of directors in strategy formulation and implementation - two aspects that have so far been left largely unaddressed by corporate governance research and practice. Design/methodology/ approach - Based on insights from strategy process literature, the paper suggests that, by ensuring consistency between resource allocation processes and the firm's intended strategy, boards could fulfil a meaningful role in strategy implementation. The proposed outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions is illustrated by a single case study of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company. Findings - The proposed approach enables corporate governance scholars to look at how boards fulfil their role in strategy implementation from a perspective similar to that of financial analysts. It might thus be suited to complement existing methods in empirical corporate governance research. Practical implications - The presented outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions helps board members to prevent role conflicts with executive management. In addition, boards may benefit from an analysis of implementation consistency, because it enables them to detect weak early warning signals of strategic divergence that require early intervention. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the discussion of alternative methods for exploring strategy issues in corporate governance research. The suggested approach outlines a potential new vantage point to investigate board involvement in strategy implementation in the event that action research is not feasible. The tentative findings from the case study put forward a set of indicators for measuring the effectiveness of boards in guiding strategy implementation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examined the human and social capital factors associated with higher post-succession firm performance in family enterprises in Singapore. We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise. We found that a successor's industry experience and diversity of network ties were positively associated with firm performance and boards that focused their role as advisors to the successor enhanced post-succession firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Prior research on corporate elites has focused on how interlocking directorships serve to create inter-organizational linkages and on what happens when board members lose their seats and those linkages are broken. Rather than focusing on the ties in corporate networks, here we focus on the nodes of these networks, the individual members of boards of directors. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the conditions under which a director will be able to retain his/her board seat even after he or she loses the executive position that provided initial entry onto the board. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The case of outside directors who have lost their executive positions in their home organizations provides an excellent opportunity to examine two competing theoretical perspectives: the inter-corporate and intra-class perspectives on corporate elites. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), directorships are demanding an increasing amount of directors' time and directors without full-time executive positions elsewhere can actually devote more energy to board activities. An unintended consequence of this legislation is a potential decrease in the number of directors who hold several board seats simultaneously. This may reduce the efficiency of information flow across organizations and slow the diffusion of innovation. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper aims to critique moral stakeholder theory (MST) and to contrast it to earlier strategic stakeholder approach (SSA). Interview data were gathered from top executives at 12 companies in the energy sector in Canada and an in-depth literature review was conducted on MST and SSA. "Value" for shareholder and stakeholder may not be mutually exclusive in some instances. MST may hold the key to giving the board a more useful, comprehensive framework of the firm's utility and purpose to society. Organizations may be selected on their ethical performance by investors. Depending on whether ethical criteria are included in the definition of "firm's value", decisions about which stakeholder theory to use become an issue of strategic importance to all organizations. The paper illustrates how the board of directors as the governing body of the organisation may find that continuous assessment of the company's stakeholders is valuable in reducing risks.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

Purpose - This paper characterizes the role of the board of directors in a more specific way than has been done previously, and uses this characterization to support the argument that, in some cases, the mandate of an effective board should go beyond the prevention of self-interested behavior by management. The enlarged role for the board of directors that this paper contemplates carries with it the need to ensure shareholders that the board of directors is not engaging in self-interested behavior of its own, and posits that requiring the board of directors to report to shareholders on its activities and effectiveness is a potential solution to this problem. The paper seeks to present theoretically grounded ideas on how this might be done in a meaningful fashion. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a "short list" of reporting items for boards of directors, derived from a theoretical model that examines board of director performance from a group dynamics perspective. Findings - This paper proposes measure for board of director performance reporting that are based upon potential active agency roles. The authors suggest that future dialogue regarding board of director performance reporting might be well served by recognizing the limitations of previous research that has found differing and questionable links between board characteristics and organizational outcomes. Research limitations/implications - The authors suggest that the items derived from the theoretical model for examining board of director performance reporting need to be empirically assessed in terms of their usefulness in a variety of industries and contexts. Practical implications - The authors argue that active agency roles and functional group dynamics should form the backbone of a board of director performance reporting process. Originality/value - This paper extends the board of director performance reporting literature by providing a theoretically grounded rationale for measuring and conceptualizing board effectiveness.

In light of the best practice recommendations released by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March 2003, this study tests the relationship between initial public offering (IPO) firm performance and board governance quality, captured by board size, board leadership, board composition, and director"s share ownership. Based on a sample of Australian IPO firms that lodged prospectuses with ASX between 1994 and 1999, we do not find evidence that links underpricing to board structures at the time of IPO. IPO firms' board structures are insignificant in explaining the level of IPO underpricing, and board size is the only board governance variable significant in explaining long-run aftermarket performance, after controlling for the size of the firm. That is, IPO firms with larger boards at the time of issuance perform better in the long-run, consistent with the resource dependence theory. Thus, we conclude that ASX"s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place, and our findings lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality.

Purpose - The early literature on specific networks of non-executive directors has shown that directors are both information sources and have specific competences. The focus of this paper is to study the specialization of directors with multiple mandates. Is the information held by directors specific in terms of geographical areas or industrial sectors? Design/methodology/approach - The Dafsalien database is used for the year 2003 on the 500 largest French groups. For each member of a sub-group referred to as the "inner circle", it was determined whether their mandates were held in French or foreign entities, and in which business sector. Findings - Geographical specialization could not be validated, but industrial specialization is proven. Boards are made up of industry specialists and those groups benefit from a clear experience curve. Practical implications - This paper brings a new approach to the analysis of directors' networks. Originality/value - The paper questions the relevance of the quest for independent directors and the limitation of mandates. On one hand directors with multiple mandates do bring an added value to boards; on the other hand their presence is limited by law and regulation. Should regulation on corporate governance lay down unrealistic rules or combine with business reality? (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the intensity of board activity, as represented by board meeting frequency, and firm financial performance, using data from the top 500 Australian companies. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return; several control variables are introduced in the analysis. The results indicate that board meeting frequency has a positive impact on subsequent shareholder return. Regarding the explanatory factors for the level of board activity, it is reported that firms with more board committees tend to have relatively more board and committee meetings; firms with larger boards have less board meetings. In addition, lower managerial ownership leads to more committee meetings.

In this paper several theories, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm performance, are tested. The results indicate that, for Australian listed companies, there is no strong relationship between leadership structure and subsequent performance. It is reported that companies with higher blockholder ownership or lower managerial shareholdings tend to have an affiliated chairman; firm with higher managerial shareholdings tend to have an executive chairman. The evidence suggests that there is no one optimal leadership structure; each structure, which could be an outcome of a rational choice process influenced by other governance characteristics of individual firms, may have associated costs and benefits.

We show that female directors have a significant impact on board inputs and firm outcomes. In a sample of US firms, we find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. These results suggest that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. Accordingly, we find that chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards. However, the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with fewer takeover defenses. Our results suggest that mandating gender quotas for directors can reduce firm value for well-governed firms. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Certain environmental and social behaviours have caused an increase in the social pressure felt by corporations when doing business. To palliate this pressure, companies have generated a means of legitimising their behaviour: the reporting of corporate social responsibility. The objective of this article is to test for the existence of relations between certain characteristics of the board of directors and the reporting of corporate social information. The results obtained show an important effect of the independence and diversity of the board in reporting practices, the independent members being the main promoters of such initiatives. On the contrary, board activity and the reputation of its Chairman have no effect, whereas the diversity of the organization signifi es a move backward in different stages of the process.

Internationalisation is one of the biggest challenges for family businesses. Although prosperous locally, many of these firms often face several difficulties in entering foreign markets. To date, there are contrasting results with respect to the internationalisation behaviour of family businesses and the role of boards of directors in this process. Adopting the resource-based view of the firm, the paper focuses on the determinants of the internationalisation pathways taken by family businesses. Basing on a sample of 146 small and medium sized Norwegian family businesses, we find that the board is an important strategic resource contributing to their international expansion. The results highlight the existence of various relationships between board member characteristics, board tasks performance and the export intensity. In particular, we find that family businesses with higher levels of non-family board members are more likely to be international. Moreover, we find that boards' involvement in advisory tasks contributes positively to the export intensity. The implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the association between the composition of the board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Results: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition - board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition - the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical Implications: The results provide support for the managerial hegemony and the resource dependency theories. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by interlocking directors with extra-industry ties. Practical Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. Interlocking directors appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification. Existing recommendations and regulations to align management with shareholders' interests through independent boards should be revised. Board composition should also consider directors' knowledge, relevant expertise, availability, and length of tenure. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Individuals sit on the board of directors and set organizational goals, individuals make the product, push new marketing campaigns, make tough decisions, create new products, and so on. What is the role of social responsibility (SR) in their thinking? Do individuals need to behave responsibly to live in a social environment? Could this be grounded in their cognition? Furthermore, is there room for SR in our cognitive processes? And then, how can this analysis help studies on socially responsible business? The article presents how the distributed cognition approach provides a viable explanation for SR in human thinking. The exploitation of external - both social and nonsocial - resources shapes cognitive processes such that the idea of the "isolated brain" is definitely abandoned. Our social cognition uses responsibility as a support mechanism that sustains or discharges distributive processes. The article uses the notion of docility to keep cognition and social behavior together. The conclusion is that SR is (1) a mechanism that allows individuals to maintain cognitive advantages and (2) it emerges when the same social channel is exploited for extended periods of time.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance in the context of recent corporate governance reforms, based on the agency and organisational literatures. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses 384 of the top 500 Australian companies as its dataset. Board composition measures include the percentages of affiliated, executive and independent members on the board. Firm risk is represented by the standard deviation of shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results show a negative impact of executive directors on subsequent risk. Affiliated and independent directors, however, have no significant effect on the level of performance variance. Blockholders give a positive influence on firm risk. Moreover, companies with poor dividend payout or low managerial shareholdings tend to be riskier. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not examine the actual risk preference of individual directors, which could involve an attitudinal survey of board members. Future research may also examine the specific attributes towards risk for each type of affiliated directors. Practical implications - The findings cast doubts on the hope that promoting board independence would reduce agency conflicts relating to managerial risk aversion, and support the proposition that, although firms may comply with the demands for more independent directors, they could employ a number of tactics to neutralize the power of outsiders. Originality/value - The empirical work surrounding this topic has been scant. This study may present the first Australian empirical evidence on the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This conceptual paper analyses why some companies in Russia give strong weight to the external roles and some to the internal roles of the boards of directors. The institutional background of Russian corporate governance is reviewed, concentrating on the contextual variables of time of founding, ownership type and governmental dependency, which are seen to explain the varying weight given to internal and external board roles. After arriving at several propositions, the paper finishes with suggestions for an empirical evaluation of the proposed relationships and addresses several managerial implications that stem from the discussion. This paper addresses the under-researched field of contingencies in board roles, focusing on Russia and emphasizing the importance of the prevailing institutional framework in transition economies.

The central question posed in this paper will be how to organize board composition in order to ensure a responsible corporate governance both from a CSR and a good governance perspective. Adopting a stakeholder approach to corporate governance, we analyze the arguments given by different theoretical approaches for linking specific board composition with financial performance and CSR, and discuss the empirical research conducted. Despite the inconclusive findings of empirical research, it can be argued that diverse stakeholders on the board will promote CSR activities within the firm, but at the same time will increase board capital (which ultimately may lead to a better financial performance). Finally, we propose a model for selecting board members based both on ethical and pragmatic arguments.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to review how corporate governance is institutionalised in Nigeria and examine the relationship between board size, CEOs' duality, board composition and the board's involvement in strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was sent by post to the chairmen of 138 publicly quoted companies in Nigeria in November 2004. Findings - Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the Nigerian public companies have embraced some principles of the Code of Best Practices for Public Companies. There is a high level of board involvement in strategy decision-making process, but no correlation was found between board involvement and a number of governance variables (board size, board independence and CEO duality). Research limitations/implications - The sample of 39 responding companies is small although it represents a 28 per cent of response rate and is representative of the Nigerian stock market. However, we are unable to look at other factors such as industry sectors and we cannot generalise our findings regarding corporate governance practices in Nigeria. Practical implications - The investment climate in Nigeria can become more reassuring than in the past although there is room for further improvements as the effectiveness of the corporate government practices is still in doubt. Originality/value - This paper adds to the scanty literature available on corporate governance practices in developing, countries. Findings extend our understanding about the strategic functions of the board in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, and the world's sixth larger producer of oil.

Purpose - The importance of top management commitment for the success of major change initiatives has been emphasized in the literature, while the role of boards of directors (the board) has been in less focus. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the boards affect the sustainability of major organizational change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on three case studies of the diffusion of total quality management (TQM), Toyota production system (TPS), and lean production (LP). Findings from these case studies are then compared to literature on management and organization and corporate governance. Findings - A TQM/TPS/LP transformation is a longterm process. In the case studies, top management commitment is crucial for the sustainability of the implemented change programs. However, a committed top management does not "last forever." The issue of sustaining change therefore falls back on the governance structure. If the board does not understand the essence of an organizational change, the risk is that top management is replaced with new leaders, who are given new directions by the board. Issues identified as important in order to create board commitment for sustainability of major organizational change are: board competence and experience, board meeting dynamics, board as a provider of critical resources, and the process of replacement of chief executive officers. The dominating agency theory within corporate governance also needs to be questioned and complemented by more recent theories such as the stewardship and the resourcedependence theories. Originality/value - This paper provides insights into the board's role in sustaining major organizational change. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

This article aims at debunking the myths of the <<cold>> CEO and of the <<emotionnally dry>> boardroom by investigating the impact of CEOs emotions on the group dynamics and performance of Boards of directors. Based on the <<affective revolution>> literature and on qualitative accounts from 40 top-level French CEOs, we propose an Emotional Contagion Model that explains why and how emotionally intelligent CEOs communicate more effectively within the boardroom in crisis situations. Testable propositions are suggested for future research.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the prevalence of directors of US Fortune 500 firms who come from an academic background, and possible unique reasons for their appointment. Design/methodology/approach - Based on extant theory of the resource-dependence roles of non-management directors, this study proposes and tests three hypotheses concerning distinctive reasons firms may appoint an academic to their boards. Academic directors may serve unique roles in increasing board demographic diversity, increasing firm intellectual capital, and providing links to local geographic constituents. Using year 2002 data from the US Fortune 500 firms, this study presents descriptive statistics and uses t-tests and x 2 tests to examine hypotheses. Findings - Firms having academics on their boards have greater board demographic diversity than firms without an academic director. Firms with academic directors have the same average emphasis on knowledge-based earnings as other firms. Academics associated with US top-ranked universities tend to be more likely to hold board seats. Firms tend to select academic directors from the geographic regions where the firm is headquartered and have a slight tendency to use them on public affairs committees. Research limitations/implications - This study's findings highlight a unique non-monitoring advantage of academic directors for firms seeking increased board diversity, and potential community/stakeholder liaisons. Practical implications - Firms wishing to increase board diversity or improve relationships with other stakeholder groups may find academic directors useful to such efforts. Academic directors appear to be just as capable as other outside directors in developing firm intellectual capital. Originality/value - This paper extends the present literature in resource dependence by examining academic directors, a new director subset. The paper is also unique in that it uses data collected from proxy statements, rather than survey data. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

Corporate governance has often been defined in a narrow way as comprising 'the range of control mechanisms that protect and enhance the interests of shareholders of business enterprises' (Fama and Jensen 1983). In the corporate governance literature there has also been a general focus on the structure and functioning of boards of directors and the responsibilities of audit committees in relation to external auditing (Rosenstein and Wyatt 1990; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). This article looks at the evolution of the role of external auditing in corporate governance. The role of the external auditor has changed through time, and consequently it should not be assumed that the role of external auditing is fixed or that it cannot be changed to meet societal needs and expectations. This observation leads to the primary argument of our article, which is that the role of the external auditor in corporate governance ought to be expanded in order to enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance for the benefit of a wider spectrum of stakeholders and society generally.

The objective of this paper is to understand the extent of inter-locking directorates among mainland Chinese companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). This study also seeks to understand if these mainland Chinese companies were different from those Chinese companies in Singapore in terms of the social network structure of its board of directors. It has been well known and indeed as part of the Chinese culture, the concept of quanxi or social networking is important. However, in the context of corporate governance, the concern is if too many directors are interlocked, will the concept of quanxi be counterproductive in the practice of attaining high standards of governance of the listed companies.

The aim of this contribution is to provide a better insight into what internal governance (IG) is all about and why IG is so essential for reaching the goal of good governance. This article focuses primarily on the relevance of governance within groups of companies - referred to as 'intra-group' governance - and tackles this topic from a legal as well as from an economic perspective. The legal analysis highlights the lack of a comprehensive framework in group law both on a European and Belgian level. The economic analysis tackles some false business arguments in order to provide a rationale for installing boards of directors on subsidiary level (the so-called 'subsidiary governance') and their potential of being supportive to existing corporate governance mechanisms.

Following the publication of the Spanish Code of Corporate Good Governance in 1998 (known as the Olivencia Code), some companies voluntarily created audit committees in line with the recommendation that all firms, and especially listed companies, should do so. The aim of this work is to analyse the factors associated with voluntary audit committee formation in companies listed on the Spanish Capital Market through 1999. In particular we analyse factors such as board independence and size, the board chairman/CEO duality, auditor size, agency costs, ownership, economies of scale, institutional investors, the audit report and auditor tenure. We find that voluntary audit committee formation is positively correlated with the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors and economies of scale, while the evidence reveals a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between board size and voluntary audit committee formation. We also formed another sample excluding financial institutions, for which we found that audit committee formation is positively associated with board independence and economies of scale, and negatively associated with the audit report and audit tenure.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Our study investigates an unexplored succession process-interim CEO successions. We define an interim CEO succession as a case where the title of chief executive officer is vacated by the incumbent and the board of directors has not announced a permanent successor, but instead designates a particular individual as 'interim CEO,' or 'acting CEO,' or 'CEO until a permanent successor is named.' Theory predicts that interim CEO successions will lead to the type of disruption that can harm firm performance, even after a permanent successor is appointed. Our data show that interim CEO succession processes are widely employed by publicly-traded U.S. firms, and that they are associated with lower performance during the period in which the interim serves. However, whether the interim CEO also simultaneously serves as chairman moderates the impact of this type of succession on firm performance, as well as on long-term firm survival.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the effects of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance on the nature of financial restatements in Malaysia and whether corporate governance characteristics are associated with financial restatements. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this paper are obtained from annual reports that had been restated for the period of 2002-2005 with firm-years being the unit of observation. A control group comprising non-restating firms is formed using match-pair procedures where restated and non-restated firms are matched by size, industry, exchange board classification, and financial year end. The data are subsequently analyzed using a t-test, the Pearson correlation and logistic regression. Findings: The results show that the primary reason for misstating the accounts is to inflate earnings. The nomination committee of the firms that restated is found to be less independent with higher managerial ownership. The logistic regression analysis indicates that the extent of ownership by outside blockholders deters firms from misstating accounts. Surprisingly, audit committee independence is associated with the likelihood of financial misstatement. Financial restatements, nevertheless, are not found to be associated with board independence, managerial ownership, and CEO duality. Finally, the results show that firms with high level of debts are more likely to commit in financial misstatement. Practical implications: The research is significant as it provides evidence on the role of corporate governance, especially the independence of the nomination committee and extent of ownership by outside blockholders in Malaysia. It shows that outside blockholders is effective in disciplining managers so that the accounts so prepared are not misleading. The move in 2007 by the Malaysian Government to require companies audit committee to be composed of only independent and non-executive directors, as well as requiring audit committee members to be financially literate, should be seen as important in ensuring the effectiveness of the audit committee. Originality/value: This research is considered as the first study which examines the effects of corporate governance variables on the incidents of financial restatements in a developing country. The findings of this paper would be useful for policy makers in evaluating the importance of corporate governance in emerging countries, specifically on the issue of quality financial reporting.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the influence of corporate board structure on corporate value. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected on a sample of 245 Thai non-financial listed companies to examine the effect of board structure on firm performance. Findings: The results show that neither independent directors nor grey directors are the significant determinants of improving firm value. Research limitations/implications: This research was confined to 245 Thai non-financial listed companies. It would be useful to replicate it using larger samples under different country settings. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance to top managers in deciding the Board structure as corporate value is also grounded in corporate board structure. Originality/value: The paper provides far reaching implications for corporate managers about the relationship between Board characteristics and corporate value. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the relationship between board composition and firm performance using a board-level aggregation variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses linear regression to analyze the relationship between board role typology and firm performance using a panel data set of 277 non-financial listed Malaysian firms over the period 2002-2007. Findings: The empirical results show that firm-boards with a high representation of outside and foreign directors are associated with better performance compared to those firm-boards that have a majority of insider executive and affiliated non-executive directors. Research limitations/implications: The findings seem to imply that in widely owned firms a higher proportion of outsiders on the board reduces under-investment and agency problems, which has significant economic implications. Originality/value: This is the first study to use a board-level aggregation variable to demonstrate the impact of boards' resourcefulness on firm performance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

The board of directors is a flat governance structure where each director has an equal vote in determining the collective actions taken by the group. Yet, some boards choose to delegate authority for specific tasks to numerous committees, while others choose to create relatively few subcommittees of the board. We investigate the determinants of subordinate board structures, exploring both their benefits and costs. Using a sample of the S&P 1500 we find that subordinate board structures are positively related to board size and the proportion of outside directors, even after controlling firm characteristics such as complexity and ownership structure. Further tests indicate that these board structures can offset the negative associations that board size and the proportion of outsiders can have with firm performance. Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, where co-ordination problems among directors or social loafing may be less pronounced, we find that subordinate board structures are negatively related to firm performance. Categorizing committees as either monitoring or advisory, we find that both types of committees appear related to firm performance. Taken as whole, these results are consistent with the idea that subordinate board structures can be a costly remedy to alleviate problems that arise with larger, more outsider dominated boards.

Compared to the debate on corporate governance in the private sector and to the literature on the macro level of governance in the public sector, the micro-level governance of public organisations remains a neglected area of discussion. Against this backdrop, the paper presents an overview of international literature regarding boards in the public sector organisations, in order to evidence if, and in which terms, the board of directors has been a topic of research in public governance in the recent years. In conclusion, the paper provides suggestions for future research on boards in public organisations. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of corporate governance by analyzing the impact of board structure on firm technical efficiency. Resampling methods and bootstrapping techniques applied in Data Envelopment Analysis are used to evaluate firm performance. Truncated regressions are estimated to determine the effect of five board characteristics-board size, board independence, board reputation, board diversity and board activity-on efficiency. The result of this empirical study shows that business technical efficiency increases with a heterogeneous board with a limited number of directorships per director and with a limited activity specified in a reduced number of annual board meetings with a higher number of specialized committees.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

The interplay of the board of directors (BOD) and the chief executive officer (CEO) in strategy-making has been the subject of some debate in the literature. Some experts argue the BOD should take a strong role in strategy-making while the alternative point of view is that the CEO is the key man or woman. In a rigorous qualitative study including 16 interviews with leading Australian industry figures the CEO is found to be the key player in modern strategy-making. The findings identify how the BOD, individual directors and the CEO can combine to add value to the organization, in particular how these organization members can team and interact to achieve a faster, more flexible strategy cycle. The modern organization focus needs to be on giving more emphasis to the empowerment, interaction and creativity of the CEO and top management team. The BOD should focus on questioning, criticizing, refining and enabling the strategy proposed by the professional managers. However the study indicates these findings are subject to exception and variation in relation to factors including specialist knowledge, track record of performance, personality attributes, personal power, and political and influencing skills. The major focus of attention of the BOD and CEO is the strategic thinking related activities in strategy-making. Strategic planning still has an important role in formalizing strategy content, usually in a regular cycle. (c) 2011 eContent Management.

Purpose: Corporate governance is an area of interest to researchers, stakeholders and the general public. In recent times, there has been an increased concern about the effectiveness of the board within corporate organizations due to corporate scandals and accounting irregularities of some well known firms, which highlighted the inefficiency of monitoring corporate boards and the overseeing of managerial decision making. This paper aims to investigate the effects that a number of factors such as organisational demography, organisational size, ownership type, board size, CEO duality and CEO dependence/independence have on board configuration. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the literature on organisational demography and board structure characteristics. Primary data were gathered from 27 management shipping companies having their head office in Greece. Findings: Findings show high levels of influence of the CEOs on the Board of Directors, since in most cases the CEO is the Chairman of the Board and high levels of control asked by the top management teams in almost all strategic decision processes. Originality/value: The paper's contribution lies primarily on investigating issues relating to corporate governance in an extremely dynamic, highly extrovert, truly international and at the same time family owned sector; the shipping industry.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the power dynamics of the boards of directors in family-owned and listed Turkish companies. Power and dominance in the boardroom can be studied in relation to three variables: the institutional environment in which the firm is embedded; the structural configurations of the board; and the top manager's propensity to exercise his/her power resources. Focusing on the board level, this paper aims to conceptualize power dynamics as being composed of structural attributes, roles assumed, responsibilities, dependency and representation. Design/methodology/approach: The research domain of this exploratory study is family-owned and listed companies operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The data for the study were collected from three different sources: a survey administered to members of the boards of directors; discourse analysis of corporate governance compliance reports of the same companies; and in-depth interviews conducted with board members. Findings: This study shows that on a typical board of directors of a family-owned and listed Turkish company, the interests of owners and managers are aligned and other stakeholders are not represented; the role of the board is confined to visibility and legitimacy and does not include control. Originality/value: This paper argues that theories developed for Anglo-Saxon equity-market based business systems have limited exploratory power for an emerging economy - namely Turkey - that is based on a business system characterized by close co-operation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to research studies on boards of directors in the Chinese transition economy that are by far, few and limited. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses basic data compilation method to investigate the board characteristics of large and medium Chinese companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2006. Sample data on these companies were obtained from the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) database that contains information on at least 1,350 listed companies in a particular year. Companies with missing data or incomplete information on board attributes are not included in the sample in this paper. Studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance in the Chinese context are compared to those studies in the West for determining whether there is a conclusive empirical outcome. Findings: This investigation found some significant differences in board characteristics between the Chinese and Western contexts, such as non-compliance with legal requirement, equity-based compensation structure for board members, and lag in the establishment of Chinese board committees as compared to their counterparts in developed Western countries. In addition, the literature review reveals that studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance from the small community of scholars investigating the Chinese context produce inconclusive results similar to those studies of the West. Practical implications: The empirical findings and literature review suggest that the prototype of an effective board may vary from one industry to another, or even from one company to another, and perhaps across time for the same company. Originality/value: This contingency approach to board impact on firm performance may be relevant to companies operating in the Chinese transition economy, where factors are evolving continuously at the micro, macro, and international levels.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

Recent research into the role of boards of directors has adopted a cognitive point of view rather than a traditional governance perspective rooted in agency theory (Charreaux and Wirtz, 2006). The present study examines the structural embeddedness of boards and the influence of networks of boards of directors on the adoption of corporate governance practices. More specifically, it focuses on two aspects of social capital, namely the cohesion between actors within dense and closed networks (Coleman, 1988), and openness within networks containing numerous structural holes (Burt, 1992). The main results of this study emphasize the crucial role of board's network openness in the adoption of corporate governance practices and the importance of the diversity of cognitive resources acquired by boards of directors within their social networks.

This article examined the effects of board structure of American media companies on their performance from a stakeholder perspective. Results showed that both the level of board interlocks and the proportion of non-independent directors on the board were positively associated with corporate performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity. Results also showed that the adoption of staggered boards had a positive effect on return on assets of media companies. However, this study did not find any relationship between board size and firm performance within media industries. (c) 2010 Journal of Media Business Studies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of effective, knowledgeable and accountable management and board structures in business organisations. Using the case of Swissair, the paper aims to demonstrate the importance of competent industry knowledgeable executive boards, with regard not only to company profits and sustainability but also to stability and socially responsible decision making. Design/methodology/approach: An explanatory and descriptive case study approach was undertaken utilising historical data and literature-based information and research on Swissair. The analysis of the case is guided by the use of the Resource Dependence and Group Conformity theories. Findings: The findings suggest that the alliance and acquisition strategy pursued by Swissair's management and the lack of leadership and accountability by the CEO and Chairman of the board were the main contributing factors to the company's collapse. Practical implications: The implications include impacts on the way in which European organisations are governed and the composition of the management teams and Board of Directors. Additional implications include changes to the legislation in Europe, more specifically Switzerland and the European Free Trade Alliance, aimed at the prevention of similar future collapses. Originality/value: The paper's originality stems from the application of decision making and group theory, coupled with corporate governance ideas applied in a practical sense to the contemporary case of Swissair in a manner previously not considered, to demonstrate the importance of effective, knowledgeable and accountable management and board structures in organisations. Value is demonstrated with the recent issues experienced by Austrian Airlines and its subsequent acquisition by Lufthansa, indicating a need to address the corporate governance requirements in the European airline industry.

The link between business and family is the track which follows an investigation in order to present the advantages and restrictions shown by organisations called as family businesses. This research contributes to the family business literature by demonstrating that the factor "relationship family-business" is more effective for understanding the family business behaviour than the traditional evolutionary cycle analysis. This article proves that the family-business relationship is manifested in the set of objectives, family and business. The organization pursues some objectives that are related to governance practices in each area (strategy process, succession, human resources and board of directors). The results demonstrate that the family business which integrates family and business objectives in their vision use family and business practices at the same level of importance.

Within the corporate governance literature the notion of diversity has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism (See for example the Tyson Report 2003). This interest has emerged in part due to various national legislative reforms introducing mandatory quotas for female directors. As the debate surrounding these reforms emerges and begins to take form, it is important that the prevailing paradigm of democracy is not taken for granted but is subject to critical scrutiny. Drawing on Ernesto Laclau's On Populist Reason in particular, the paper attempts to problematize notions of difference and representational democracy that lie at the heart of the reforms. The aim of the paper is to stimulate further debate on the democratizing potential of the recent political interventions in the composition of the boards of directors.

The current financial crisis has deep macroeconomic roots, but the dominant view of the firm has made the crisis deeper and more devastating. Over the past few decades, maximizing shareholder value has become the main objective of the firm. Chief executives have been keen on this objective because their economic incentives have been clearly associated with stock market performance. Unfortunately, this has driven many CEOs to make terrible decisions based on short-termism and greed. In this way, the firm has become the object of anger, criticism and cynicism. In Building Respected Companies, Jordi Canals argues that we must address this problem by developing companies that serve society, not just their shareholders. This requires a new perspective of what a firm is, what the purpose of the firm in society should be and what the role of the board of directors and senior executives should be.

This study explores the influence Boards of Directors' demographic characteristics on the process of making strategic decisions. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 105 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The results suggest that educational level affect both the financial reporting and the hierarchical decentralisation in the strategic decision-making process. Also, functional background of executives was found to be related with financial reporting. However, the educational specialty did not appear to have any significant influence on the strategic decision-making process. In light of these findings, implications for practitioners are made and avenues for future research are suggested.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

In the theoretical framework of corporate governance, this article studies the efficiency of the control exerted by the ownership structure and the board of directors on managers for the purpose of privileging investment in R&D. This efficiency is sensitive to national systems of governance. Tests realized on a sample of 531 U.S., Japanese and French firms with the canonical method corroborate the existence of positive relationships between concentration of ownership, the internal administrator dominance and the non-dual structure on the one hand, and the investment in R&D, on the other.

Most prior studies have argued that the relationship between firm complexity and board size is a monotonic one: complex firm tend to have a large board size. Contrary to previous work, it is hypothesized in this study that this relationship is more likely to be moderated by board leadership structure. Using a sample of 92 Egyptian listed firms over the period from 2000 to 2004, we found that firm complexity exerted a positive and significant coefficient on board size when the firm adopts a leadership structure that separates the roles of CEO and chairman. However, the incremental effect of firm complexity on board size was negative and significant for firms that combine the roles of CEO and chairman (i.e., CEO duality). This study provides supportive evidence for the argument that firms are more likely to manipulate their boards' characteristics to attain organizational adaptation at the minimum total cost. Thus, studying of one main characteristic of the board of directors without taking into account the expected effect of other characteristics may lead to inconclusive evidence. This study offers insights to practising managers and policy makers. If practising managers want to maximize the value of their firms, they need to broaden their insight to understand that board characteristics are multidimensional, contingent and dynamic in their nature and differ not only across firms and industry, but also across countries. Moreover, before developing and launching new and additional corporate governance reforms, policy makers need to realize that differences in corporate governance systems cannot be fully explained outside their institutional environments.

Using a large sample of European listed Companies and their Directors our study supports the hypothesis that European corporate governance do not yet converging towards a common model. Our results put in evidence in fact the existence of three dominant corporate governance profiles in European listed companies, different each others. The determinants of these profiles depend on the typical governance system adopted by the same companies and on country's culture and history; as a consequence, each of them has a own attitude of the board, in terms of structure, organization and skill mix characteristics. Finally we suggest some important implications on European governance practices.

This paper uses a sample of 76 family businesses in Tunisia to investigate the impact of the family firm dynamic on the composition of their boards of directors. We argue that whether or not a transition in ownership is planned, firms have different governance needs and characteristics depending on the generational phase. The empirical results show that board composition is positively influenced by both generational evolution and succession planning. This study provides evidence of an increase in the appointment of outside directors to boards of family firms from the third generation of ownership. This result implies that it is important to consider the generational phase and succession process of the family firm in order to better understand its governance system.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

The aim of this paper is to present and underline the specific aspects of governance in family businesses. The system of governance of this kind of organisation is characterised by the extent and importance of the networks of personal and organic relationships that bind people to each other, and which influence the forms of governance. The key is to find a suitable balance between the powers devolved upon the Board of Directors (comprised of members of the family, or appointed by them) and those allotted to the executives, and furthermore to ensure that the balance adopted is compatible with the principal concerns of the business.

Board of directors deal with complex, strategic issues and conflict among members is natural. Group conflict is often associated with reduced productivity and lower cohesiveness. However, conflict might also improve group decision making and governance practices. This paper seeks to examine the relationship among the following: (a) three types of conflict (cognitive, affective and process) and board performance; (b) board performance and firm performance; and (c) the mediating role of board performance on board conflict and firm performance. It was found that only cognitive conflict is (positively) related to board performance. In addition, board performance does not impact firm performance nor board performance mediates the relationship between board conflict and firm performance. (c) 2010, SAGE Publications Ltd.

The board of directors is seen as the central governance instrument, promoting interaction between stakeholders and promoting high performance, organization sustainability and return to investors. The practices and strategic definitions of corporative governance are considered of great importance today for corporations, due to the size and to the complexity of their structures (like M _ Forms structures) and the different forms in which they are presented: in networks, associations, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. The aim of this article is to analyze the constitution of boards of directors, based on their attributes, and the impacts of this classification on the roles and responsibilities of the directors in Brazilian companies. For this, a quantitative survey was performed in the 300 largest companies in Brazil listed in BOVESPA - stock exchange in capital market. The results found point to a strong correlation of some attributes of the directors of the researched firms with the roles and responsibilities of the board, in relation to strategic, control, and institutional dimensions.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How are national institutional systems related to the proportion of women found on corporate boards of directors of companies listed in particular countries? Which particular types of national institutions play the most important role? We explore cross-country variation in the pattern of female representation on corporate boards and evaluate the extent to which it is associated with the nature of national institutional systems as captured in five frameworks each of which emphasizes the importance of a distinct type of national institutions. Our analysis includes 38 countries and covers the years 2001-07. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that as much as half of the variation in the presence of women on corporate boards across countries is attributable to national institutional systems and that culturally and legally-oriented institutional systems appear to play the most significant role in shaping board diversity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study suggests that country-level institutions, previously neglected in studies of board diversity, play an important role in shaping the prevalence of women on corporate boards and that these need to be more fully incorporated in future research on board diversity. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The importance of national institutional systems for board diversity suggests that policy levers of a regulatory nature and national cultural characteristics are important elements in driving corporate board diversity and offer distinct opportunities for tailoring a mix of corporate governance interventions that suit the particular institutional nature of a given country.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

We develop and test a novel theory about strategic noise with regard to CEO appointments. Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

This paper examines the relation between acquirer (abnormal) returns and governance characteristics of the board of directors of the acquiring firm. The central question is: Are higher (acquirer) abnormal returns associated with 'better' board governance, having controlled for other factors that can affect returns? As acquisitions represent a significant change in the acquirer's corporate structure and operations, the determinants of a successful acquisition are of considerable importance. We examine the relation between returns and governance variables using a sample of 80 Australian acquisitions that occurred between 1999 and 2005. We use both short-run and long-run (abnormal) returns to capture the wealth effects of the acquisitions. We find very limited evidence of a connection between our governance variables and acquirer returns.JEL Classification:G14, G34. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to attempt to verify the predicted relationship between the demographic (i.e. tenure, functional background, etc.) difference and cognitive difference among top managers and examine how such a relationship is affected by the communication among top managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal manager on a TMT, and that such a relationship is mediated by the degree of communication that the focal manager has with other team members on the TMT. Using Structural Equation Modeling techniques, these hypotheses were tested based on a sample of 348 top managers that consist of 28 top management teams. Findings: It was found that the hypothesized relationship between demographic deviation and cognitive deviation of a focal top manager was supported with respect to the tenure of a manager, but not the functional background of a manager. Moreover, it was found that communication frequency of a focal manager with other team members mediated the relationship between the tenure deviation and the cognitive deviation of the focal manager and that tenure deviation negatively influenced communication frequency, which in turn, negatively influenced the cognitive deviation of the manager. Practical implications: These findings imply that: when constructing a competitive top management, practitioners such as boards of directors of a firm should pay more attention to the tenure diversity of a top management team because tenure diversity influences the cognitive diversity of the team; and communication among members of a management team can reduce the cognitive differences among members. However, communication happens more frequently among managers with similar tenure than among managers with dissimilar tenure. To promote consensus, managers need to watch for the forming of group fault lines along tenure within their teams. Originality/value: As far as is known, this is the first study that uses relational demography to examine the influence of tenure difference on cognitive difference among members of a top management team and to expose a mediating role played by communication frequency.

Identifying, attracting, and maintaining the engagement of the right composition of people for a non-profit Board is a major challenge. Executives should ensure that their Boards accurately represent the stakeholders that matter, both from industry and the community. The purpose of this paper is to describe ways and offer propositions for effective non-profit executives to identify, recruit, and motivate the continuing engagement of the members needed on their Boards in order to acquire resources critical to their sustained success. The Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) are used as an example, since at least 93 percent of CVBs have a governance structure that includes a Board of Directors. Successfully attracting the right mix of stakeholders is a result of an extensive recruitment effort by the CVB executive. Prior research reports that successful executives take great care in making selection decisions that reflect the interests of the community in the Board's composition. Based on the literature on Boards and governance, the authors develop propositions regarding the composition of CVB Boards. While the research is exploratory, it is found that CVBs with more diverse Boards are more successful than those with less diverse Boards. It is argued that effective CVBs use a thoughtful process for heterogeneous Board selection. It is also suggested that Board performance should be evaluated on an annual basis to recognize the need for active involvement in the Board selection process. The successful selection of Board members is important because of the implications for Board effectiveness. While there is a large body of literature offering advice on Board selection, there is little on recruitment. Moreover, there is little discussion of Board composition strategy based on balancing access to critical resources of stakeholders. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. (c) Baker College 2011.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

What is a board of directors to do, in the face of competing demands on the resources of the company and conflicting perspectives on what their roles are and should be? Corporate governance has become a central theme in management in the past two decades owing to a string of major corporate failures and evidence that the boards of these companies either failed to grasp the scale of the problems or failed to stand up to managers. Those corporations might have set out upon the wrong strategy, or engaged in fraud, or unethical behaviour, or simply suffered from bad luck. Their failures have led to a debate both with industry and in public policy about what mechanisms might prevent a recurrence, not least because they show how great the influence of the corporate sector is on society at large. In this chapter we consider how boards contribute to governing the corporation, the tensions they face along the way, and how theories of corporate governance point to the persistence of those tensions.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

The role of boards in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Ye t to date there is little theoretical and empirical study regarding the question of how board information affects the boards of directors' strategic involvement. Using a survey data from 104 responses of chairpersons collected in the year of 2010 in China, we examine how board information affects boards' behaviors of strategic involvement. Our study shows that quality of information, information diversity, frequency of board interaction, and proactive seeking information positively influence boards' strategy monitoring and advisory. These findings provide empirical support for agency theory and resource dependence theory on boards. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Wealth creation insights by the creator of the company life-cycle framework known as the CFROI valuation model. Investors searching for companies whose future profitability will far exceed that implied in current stock prices, those in business making decisions to improve company performance, and politicians crafting legislation-all use some form of a wealth creation framework. In this book, author Bartley Madden addresses how to think about the complex dynamics in generating wealth and the practical benefits to be gained from upgrading one's wealth creation framework. Throughout these pages, Madden shares six critical insights: A systems mindset focuses not so much on the individual pieces of a system, but on how all the pieces work together to achieve the goal envisioned for the system. The systems way of thinking described in Wealth Creation helps to avoid unintended, bad consequences, and to generate insights for leveraging change that produces big gains in wealth Economic systems -- the rules and relationships that exist to create wealth by delivering value to customers -- are devilishly complex and therefore solving economic problems requires extensive knowledge. Seen in this light, knowledge growth and wealth creation are two sides of the same coin. A prerequisite to making better buy/hold/sell investment decisions and business judgments is an improved understanding of how wealth is created. An especially useful approach described in this book is to connect business firms' financial performance to stock prices via the firms' competitive life-cycle framework A deeper understanding of business firms makes it plain that customers,employees, and shareholders havemutual, long-term interests. In other words, a free-market system geared to serving customers through competition is a system in which participants share the wealth that is jointly created There is a huge opportunity for sustained, higher economic growth through voluntary initiatives by the private sector. One initiative involves an accelerated implementation of lean management, which was pioneered by Toyota. This is a systems approach that continually purges waste and optimizes the use of resources in delivering value to customers The other initiative concerns improved corporate governance. The wealth creation principles discussed in this book offer a blueprint for boards of directors to vastly improve how they fulfill their responsibility to shareholders, and in so doing, improve the performance of corporate America These ideas have taken shape as a natural outgrowth of a commercial research program that began in 1969 at Callard, Madden & Associates focused on how to value business firms. It produced the CFROI (cash-flow-return-on-investment) metric and its related life-cycle valuation model. This work was further advanced at HOLT Value Associates, which was later acquired by Credit Suisse in 2002. Credit Suisse HOLT continues the research to improve the valuation tools and related global database that analyzes 20,000 companies in over 60 countries. This system is used by a large number of institutional money management firms worldwide in order to make better investment decisions. (c) 2010 Bartley J. Madden. All rights reserved.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

This paper explores board decision-making in social enterprises. It argues that while dominant theoretical frameworks (agency and stakeholder theories) help to understand the challenges faced by the boards of social enterprises, they need to be complemented to account, more adequately, for challenges deriving from the confounding logics framing valuations of organizational effectiveness in social enterprises. The paper identifies pace of decision-making as a crucial variable that requires further research attention and, building on the literature on group decision and dynamics, it advances several factors that can frame the expediency (or sluggishness) with which the boards of social enterprises take decisions.

The study seeks to understand how the firm's ownership structure and the board of directors' composition influence the structural capital. The latter is apprehended by three main levers: TMT compensation, innovation, and firm's reputation. By mobilizing several panel linear regressions on 274 American firms, the results show that the firms which heavily invest in structural capital are more successful and chaired by the younger and heterogeneous TMT. No disciplinary effect of the board on structural capital has been found. The results support the cognitive theory assumptions. The classic perspective failed to explain the structural capital phenomena. In order to enhance their structural capital, firms must pay a close attention to their board cognitive contribution and not to its disciplinary role.

This study scrutinises the association between ownership identity and board size in a unique institutional setting: state-owned enterprises in Indonesia, a country incorporating a two-tier management structure. It investigates whether the ownership identity explains the size of the board of commissioners by using the year 2006 data set from 155 SOEs in Indonesia consisting of 112 of fully SOEs and 43 of partially- privatised SOEs. This study hypothesizes that SOEs with a higher level of private sector ownership will have a greater incentive to monitor the performance of executive management through board of commissioners than those SOEs that are fully owned by the state government. It finds that compared to those fully SOEs, the partially-privatised SOEs are likely to have more board of commissioners. Even though this result is not statistically significant and, therefore, the proposed hypothesis is not statistically supported, the regression statistical analysis reveals that control variables assist in explaining the size of board of commissioners. The size of the board of directors as a control variable is significantly associated with the size of the board of commissioners. Other control variables including size of the SOE as well as the return on equity measure moderately explain the size of the board of commissioners. The findings give insight to stakeholders such as regulators or the private sector investors interested in making investment decisions in Indonesia considering the ownership structure and the effect on the effectiveness of the board of commissioners.

This study examines whether board of director's independence, financial expertise, gender, corporate governance experience and diligence impact the audit report lag exhibited by Australian publicly listed firms. Using a pooled sample of 500 firm-year observations obtained from the Australian Securities Exchange for the period 2004 to 2008, this study finds evidence that board member independence, board member financial expertise and, to a lesser extent, board member corporate governance experience are the most significant predictors associated with shorter/reduced audit report lag. Main findings are robust to alternative measures of audit report lag, board characteristics and control variables. Findings from this study clearly imply that boards play a substantial role in reducing audit report lag. Results imply that legislative and regulatory requirements, both in Australian and overseas, stipulating board member independence and financial expertise requirements are effective in improving the integrity of financial reporting, a key component of which is timeliness of financial reporting (encapsulated by audit report lag). In addition, an additional board characteristic that regulators should consider promoting among firms is board member corporate governance experience. Results from this study, therefore, have clear implications not only for regulators but also for key stakeholders such shareholders and management.

The failure of the CEO has been studied at great length in the literature. We order and classify the factors that lead to CEO failure into those a CEO can influence (endogenous) and those that are given (exogenous). The absence of unanimity in the literature leads us to conclude that insufficient attention has been paid to the main factor: the personal characteristics of CEOs. The agency approach and method are insufficient to understand leadership performance in organizations, due to the oversimplified view of human nature on which they are based and their heavy reliance on mathematical modeling.

This study empirically examines the main determinants of capital structure for listed non-financial firms in Italy and their contribution to financial sustainability, in terms of value creation for shareholders. The results show that both the pecking order theory and the trade-off theory are central in explaining the leverage of these firms and both financial approaches are important in enhancing company value and shareholders' wealth. Increasing managerial shareholding may have a role in reducing the self-interested behaviours of managers and thus leading to a higher leverage and superior financial sustainability, at least at low levels of holdings, but the results are weak. Institutional shareholding entails a positive impact on leverage owing to the function of control that institutions exert on the overall managerial activity and boards of directors. Moreover, institutions themselves are disposed to finance firms by debt, when they have a control over their boards of directors. The negative relationship between public institution shareholding and leverage implies a strict managerial control and a rigorous debt policy by public institutions. Board size and board composition are negatively related to leverage, whereas chief executive officer duality has a positive impact on leverage, but none of these latter three relationships is statistically significant.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, this paper examines the relationship of board composition, leadership and structure on sustainability disclosure. We discuss that good corporate governance and sustainability disclosure can be seen as complementary mechanisms of legitimacy that companies may use to dialogue with stakeholders. Specifically we claim that, as disclosure policies emanate from the board of directors, sustainability disclosure may be a function of the board attributes: we investigate the relationship between different characteristics of the board and sustainability disclosures among US and European companies. Our results show that in order to explain the effect of board composition on sustainability disclosure we need to go beyond the narrow and traditional distinction between insider and independent directors, focusing on the specific characteristics of each director.

This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate board characteristics on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms. Board characteristics studied comprise board size, board skill, board nationality, board gender, board ethnicity and CEO duality. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the random-effects and fixed-effects generalised least squares (GLS) regression to test the six hypotheses formulated for the study, while controlling for firm size and firm age. Findings: Using panel data from 122 quoted firms in Nigeria between 1991 and 2008, it was found that board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were negatively linked with firm performance, whereas board nationality, board ethnicity and the number of board members with a PhD qualification were found to impact positively on firm performance. The result of the robustness test using the same board characteristics for 160 small firms showed that board duality was positively linked to firm performance, while a PhD qualification was negatively linked to firm performance. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of the board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality and other organisational attributes such as ethnic diversity, foreign nationality and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively. The results provide an insight for practitioners and policy makers on the importance of relying on institutional specifics in the prescription of corporate governance codes. Originality/value: The study adds value to the global corporate governance discourse in two ways: first, the use of Nigeria, which is claimed to have one of the weakest business cultures in the world, and secondly, using a good number of proxies that are country-specific for corporate boards.

This paper investigates the impact of social ties on the effectiveness of boards of directors. When the chief executive officer (CEO) and a number of directors belong to the same social networks, the CEO is less likely to be dismissed for poor performance. The results are robust to different measures of performance and networks, and consistent after controlling for CEO ability and connected boards' superior information. Although being ousted is costly for all CEOs-who must then devote time to finding new employment and only succeed in 62% of cases-socially connected CEOs are more likely to find new and better employment after a forced departure. Evidence from this paper suggests that close social ties between board members and CEOs impact the workings of the board of directors. (c) 2012 INFORMS.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines how the composition and characteristics of corporate boards relates to firms' success and solvency; the study here focuses on the question of insolvency. This study finds that both board composition and member characteristics relate to whether or not firms can avoid bankruptcy. Boards have a major role to play in whether or not the company can remain solvent. A more versus less independent board, one which is larger and comprised of older members, has more members currently serving as CEOs of other companies, and whose independent/outside directors own less stock is best positioned to help a firm remain out of bankruptcy. Firms may use the results to custom tailor boards as older members retire and new members are inducted. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc..

Using a sample of 4,278 listed UK firms, we construct a social network of directorship-interlocks that comprises 31,495 directors. We use social capital theory and techniques developed in social network analysis to measure a director's connectedness and investigate whether this connectedness is associated with their compensation level and their firms overall performance. We find connectedness is positively associated with compensation and with the firm's future performance. The results do not support the view that executive and outside directors use their connections to extract economic rents. Rather the company compensates these individuals for the resources these better connections provide to the firm. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Previous research brought evidence of the influence of board composition for bringing strategic resources for innovation, as well as evidence of positive outcomes of board diversity. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of various indicators of board diversity on innovation. In this paper, we will explore the relationship between several aspects of board diversity (gender and age) and four types of innovation, i.e. product, process, organizational, marketing from a sample of 176 French firms based on data from French Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in 2008 and annual reports. Our results show evidence of the influence of board diversity on all types of innovation except process innovation. Findings provide discussions for the impact of board diversity on innovation.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article, we provide an empirical analysis to investigate whether politicians serving on the board of directors for banks influence performance, lending, and risk taking behaviours. We refer our analysis to all politicians (almost 160,000) belonging to a political body in Italy. Overall, our dataset contains 1,808 board members referring to 123 cooperative banks. Our results suggest that politicians who hold executive roles on the board of directors seem to exert a negative impact on banking activity. Therefore, in the current debate on the reform of the statutes of the Italian cooperative banks, we argue that the problem is not having politicians on the board of directors for banks, but rather allowing politicians to hold executive positions.

There is a growing consensus that boards of directors "matter," but the specific effects of board influences on organizational innovation remain unclear. Although boards of directors have been studied extensively in diverse disciplines-finance, management, sociology, nonprofit management, and economics-those studies have focused primarily on how board variables influence organizational effectiveness and performance. Missing from these studies is explanation of the relationships between the board of directors and organizational innovation (Wu, 2008a). This article links previous research and theories on governance and organizational innovation, examines how the board of directors may influence organizational innovation, and presents an integrative model that includes direct and indirect linkages between the board demographic and process variables, board effectiveness, and organizational innovation.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

This article investigates the simultaneous participation of directors in 320 Brazilian-listed companies in 2001, 2003, and 2005. Our results show that interlocking directorates are a common practice in Brazil. Firm value is, on average, negatively impacted by interlocking directorships, especially in firms in which a majority of directors hold three or more board positions. We also find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between interlocking and return on assets, consistent with the hypothesis that low and moderate levels of this practice may be beneficial to a company, while a high degree of interconnectedness among directors is likely to hurt performance.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

The objective of this paper is to determine the managerial governance characteristics related to financially distress companies. The failure of boards to accomplish their monitoring duties seemed to be one of the main reasons behind the actual financial distress and bankruptcy that swept companies across the planet. Through the analysis of a sample of 178 Lebanese non-listed and family owned firms, the results showed that the boards (that have a higher proportion of outside directors) are less inclined to face financial distress than the boards with a lower proportion. In addition, a different conclusion proves that the board's size and financial distress are directly linked. The paper highlights the extent to which financial distress is associated with corporate governance from a Euro Mediterranean country. It would be a source of education to Lebanese investors, who excessively go for short-term returns, and of help to regulatory authorities in the framework of making policies on corporate governance reformation.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the board diversity and the investments in innovation in a sample of companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (named Borsa Italiana) and operating in the consumer goods and in the consumer services industry. This sample covers the period from 2006 to 2010 and contains 345 observations. Drawing on the literature review, we pinpointed six hypotheses related to the impact on the investments in innovation of the following independent variables: 1. presence of outside directors; 2. average number of the other positions held by the members of the board; 3. minority shareholder representatives on the board; 4. presence of women on the board of directors; 5. number of committees; 6. frequency of board meetings. Furthermore, on the basis of the previous empirical studies, to measure the investments in innovation (the dependent variable), we chose these accounting ratios: total intangible assets divided by total assets and total R&D costs divided by total sales. From the methodology standpoint, we used both the bivariate statistic (i.e. Pearson Correlations and Anova one way) and the multivariate one (i.e. OLS regression analysis with robust standard errors calculated by the Newey-West, HAC method). Our findings confirm the previous studies and show that, also for the Italian listed companies operating in the industries mentioned earlier, the outsiders as well as the frequency of meetings held by the Strategy Committee assume a relevant role in supporting the investments in innovation. Conversely, the other independent variables concerning board diversity (i.e. women, minority shareholder representatives etc.) are not statistically significant and, as a result, do not influence the investments in innovation.

Malaysia is one of the rapidly developing economies in South-East Asia which embraces the concept of good corporate governance due to the 1997-1998 Asian financial crises. This study investigates the relationship between board of directors and company's capital structure in an emerging market, Malaysia. This research paper covers 75 non-financial leading Malaysian companies, which are employed as a price index, listed on Kuala Lumpur stock exchange (KLSE) from the year 2005 to 2008 fiscal years. A multiple regression analysis has been used to examine the linkage between board of director's features and capital structure decisions of the listed companies. Measures of board of directors employed are size of the board, presence of non-executive directors on the board, presence of independent non-executive directors on the board and CEO/Chair duality. Results reveal that board size and presence of independent non-executive directors on the board have significant, negatively and positively correlation with debt to asset ratio respectively. However corporate capital structure decisions are not found significantly influenced by CEO/Chair duality and the presence of non-executive directors on the board. Consequently based on the results, board of director's features such as board size and presence of independent non-executive directors on the board play an important role in determination of financial mix of the companies.

Over the last ten years, the corporate governance context in most Western countries has changed as a result of irregularities, increased regulation, heightened societal expectations and shareholder activism. This paper examines the impact of the changing context on the role of chairmen of supervisory boards in the Netherlands. Based on a combination of thirty semi-structured interviews with board members of leading Dutch corporations and secondary data on the position of supervisory board chairmen at the top-100 listed firms in the Netherlands, the study reveals that board chairmen have become increasingly involved in both their control and service roles. While the demographics (i. e., age, tenure, gender and nationality) of chairmen have hardly changed over the last decade, chairmen are spending considerably more time on boards and committees, have reduced the number of board interlocks and have become more active on the forefront of the corporate governance discussion. The paper highlights several implications for scholars and practitioners. (c) 2010 The Author(s).

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

This study offers to regulators and practitioners evidence on the role of the board of directors' composition in the financial distress of family businesses in an emerging economy such as Lebanon. The paper examines the role of outside directors, insiders' equity ownership, and CEO-board chair duality on the financial distress of non-listed family-owned firms. Between the periods of 2007-2010, the authors investigate 276 firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group, using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance. Empirical results based on a longitudinal sample indicate that (1) the presence of outside directors on the board of directors has no effect on financial distress; and (2) insiders' equity ownership reduceod of financial distress; whereas, (3) the CEO-board chair duality increases the probability of financial distress of Lebanese family businesses. The findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators towards a selective implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance of one of the pillar of the Lebanese economy. The replacement of an inside director by an outsider will not increase the chance of survival of familyowned firms. In contrast, equity ownership held by insiders and the separation of the CEO-Chairperson position can be used as a tool to reduce agency costs, and as a result, enhance the financial performance.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of board of directors (BOD) on corporate performance in value addition efficiency (VAE) of resources in an emerging economy namely Thailand in the context of post Asian financial crisis 1997/1998 period. This research uses data of top, as per market capitalisation, listed companies in Thailand for 2005 and 2008 to test the relationship. The study measures VAE of resources using Pulic's value added intellectual coefficient (VAICTM) model. The results find the impact of different BOD attributes on VAE of resources in top Thai companies, which is increasing over the post Asian crisis period. However, the study do not find significant impact of all BOD attributes on VAE which indicates the juvenile state of the BOD's effectiveness in achieving sustainable corporate performance. Managers and the policy makers may use the results to understand the complicated magnitude of BOD governance and its effectiveness in top companies in emerging economy, which might have the implication in developing more effective corporate governance structure in order to tackle the adverse effects of any further financial crisis.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

Social activists and government agencies seek greater diversity on corporate boards without any considerations of firm or governance characteristics. Using a comprehensive dataset on over 8000 firms from 1996 through 2005, we explore the potential determinants of socially homogeneous boards based on the advisory and monitoring needs of a firm. We find that director-homogeneity is associated with lower advertising intensity, lower R&D intensity but greater firm risk. Director-homogeneity is also positively associated with measures of CEO influence such as CEO ownership, CEO tenure, non-independence of nominating committee and director ownership. Overall, the empirical evidence implies that firms choose social diversity on the board of directors based on the economic needs and existing governance structures. (c) 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study focuses on the role of corporate political resources in shaping firm strategy in an extension of resource dependence theory. Using a sample of 92 regional banks for the period 1997-2004 in Japan, this paper explores the effect of amakudari (translated as the appointment of former bureaucrats to the boards of directors of private organizations) on the performance and managerial risk-taking of banks. We found that amakudari networks have a negative impact on a bank's profitability in the post-bubble crisis era when firm-specific and other variables are controlled. In addition, the evidence shows that a bank appointing more ex-bureaucrats to its board of directors has a tendency to get involved in more risky lending activities. Furthermore, the empirical results of this study are also found to be robust using the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator.

This paper presents a critical analysis of the choice and design of executive pay incentive scheme arrangements implemented at the time of a company's initial public offering. Using a unique sample of 311 entrepreneurial companies over a five year period ( 1998-2002) it discovers that 172 companies implement executive share option schemes for the first time at their initial public offering. Taking this sub-sample, the paper evaluates and analyses the strategic choices made with regard to incentive pay schemes by the board of directors at this crucial time in a company's development. It finds that company's choices are split between schemes that have performance targets linked to reward and others that are contrary to the guidelines of the UK's Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Furthermore, it shows company characteristics that affect schemes and elaborates on the configuration of incentive schemes in respect of three critical elements: the performance target, comparator, and target level requirement for the shares to vest. In light of this, it proposes strategic reasons as to how these schemes might be set for initial public offerings and proposes that explanations for implementation are not underpinned by traditional agency theory but linked to a resource based view of the firm.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the orientation of a firm's governance choices along a continuum of shareholder voice to managerial power and tests whether the governance orientation of a firm can survive regulation. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 873 firms, a set of three index measures is constructed reflecting the orientation of a firm's governing rules, the orientation of the board of directors and the overall orientation of both types of governance structures. The resulting measures are compared pre- and post-SOX. Findings - While specific, individual governance components, such as independence, can be regulated, the overall orientation of a firm's governance mechanisms, as manifested by its aggregate choice of governance structures, appears to be constant overtime suggesting that it is difficult to regulate the governance orientation of a firm. Research limitations/implications - The findings may be limited due to sample bias. There is both survivor bias and listing bias in the sample. To be included in the sample, firms needed to be publicly listed from 1998 through 2006 and needed to be listed on a major S&P index for each of those years. Practical implications - The paper highlights ways in which companies circumvent the intention of regulations such as SOX. The paper therefore has implications for regulators and shareholders. Originality/value - While the index method has been used before it has not been used to compare the impact of regulation on governance orientation. That makes this paper of value to regulators when considering the cost and benefit of regulations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Due to recent economic and ethical scandals, in particular those revealed by the 2008 crisis, globalisation of investments will require credible management strategies able to reassure investors. Many traditional studies of corporate governance highlight the necessity for the board of directors to discipline their CEO, using incentive and direct supervision mechanisms. The financial scandals that continue to shake the economic sphere show that this approach has not proven to be effective. We have to question the classical paradigm that considers the CEO to be a passive actor. Opportunistic managerial behaviors are not the only causes of organisational abuses. Indeed, shareholders can ruin organisational value with short-term pressure. Our main hypothesis is that power and counter power are at the same time sources of acts and interactional constraints, creating a dynamic relational field between the shareholder and the CEO. Thus, a double agency relationship is proposed, specifically based on a double relationship of control between the Chairman of the Board and his CEO. (c) 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

More specifically, we posit that different interests between the founder and professional investors make the BG particularly vulnerable to faulty processes within the board. These issues are explored in three Norwegian BGs with different risk and ownership profiles. We find that 1 conflicts are much more rife in fast growing BGs with external investors 2 family and friends of the founder represent 'patient capital' 3 agency problems are less prevalent than in 'ordinary firms' 4 board members without concrete knowledge of the business of the BG firm are prone to play a lesser role in the strategic decision making process.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Firms with central boards also experience higher future return-on-assets growth and more positive analyst forecast errors. Return prediction, return-on-assets growth, and analyst errors are concentrated among high growth opportunity firms or firms confronting adverse circumstances, consistent with boardroom connections mattering most for firms standing to benefit most from information and resources exchanged through boardroom networks. Overall, our results suggest that director networks provide economic benefits that are not immediately reflected in stock prices. (c) 2013.

Although the composition of the board of directors has important implications for different aspects of firm performance, prior studies tend to focus on financial performance. The effects of board composition on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance remain an under-researched area, particularly in the period following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). This article specifically examines two important aspects of board composition (i.e., the presence of outside directors and the presence of women directors) and their relationship with CSR performance in the Post-SOX era. With data covering over 500 of the largest companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and spanning 64 different industries, we find empirical evidence showing that greater presence of outside and women directors is linked to better CSR performance within a firm's industry. Treating CSR performance as the reflection of a firm's moral legitimacy, our study suggests that deliberate structuring of corporate boards may be an effective approach to enhance a firm's moral legitimacy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate board size and promoter ownership on firm value for selected Indian companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyses the corporate governance structure of 176 Indian firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange using linear regression analysis. Findings: The empirical findings show a negative relationship of board size with firm value and significant positive association of promoter ownership with corporate performance. The study suggests that only above a critical ownership level of 40 percent does promoter's interest become aligned with that of the company, resulting in positive effect on firm value. Research limitations/ implications: The research has been limited to some selected Indian companies, with focus only on board size and promoter ownership as predictor variables. The study suggests that corporate governance reforms in India and introduction of non-executive independent directors to the board have resulted in diminishing effect of board size on the firm value. Practical implications: The study implies that for emerging economies like India, it is practical to have greater ownership control by promoters to enhance company value. Also, it is not advisable to have a board size above certain limit. Originality/value: The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size and promoter ownership.

This paper explores the phenomenon of positive organizational deviance from institutional norms by establishing practices that protect or enhance the natural environment. Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors-the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

In this article, we use a sample of Norwegian quoted companies in the period of 2001-2010 to explore whether the gender quota requiring 40 % female directors on corporate boards changes the likelihood of women being appointed to top leadership roles as board chairs or corporate CEOs. Our empirical results indicate that the gender quota and the resulting increased representation of female directors provide a fertile ground for women to take top leadership positions. The presence of female board chairs is positively associated with female directors' independence status, age and qualification, whilst the presence of female CEOs is positively related to the average qualification of female directors. Firms with older and better educated female directors are more likely to appoint female board chairs. The likelihood of female CEOs' appointment increases with the percentage of independent directors and directors' qualifications, especially those for female directors. Furthermore, the gender gaps with respect to qualification, board interlocks and nationality between female and male board chairs vanishes after Norwegian companies' full compliance to the quota in January 2008. However, the gender quota has no significant impact on the gender gaps between female and male directors after its full compliance. Our article thereby contributes to understanding how gender quotas, presence of female directors, percentage of female directors on boards and other board characteristics can determine the gender of top leaders of organizations.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

When academic researchers, business commentators, and boards of directors have debated the merits of hiring new CEOs from outside the firm, the implicit or explicit assumption typically made is that outsider CEOs will provide an advantage in achieving strategic change. In this study, we challenge this assumption by employing a duality perspective on stability/change, and we provide an original conceptual framework to posit that it is the presence of corporate stability (ordinary succession, a long-tenured predecessor CEO, and good firm performance) that allows outsider CEOs to generate a greater degree of post-succession strategic change. We use extensive longitudinal data from US airline and chemical industries between 1972 and 2010 to test our hypotheses, and we discuss how our supportive findings challenge long-standing assumptions regarding the outsider succession-strategic change relationship, and we advocate embracing the non-intiutive notion that stable (unstable) conditions can be enablers (barriers) of strategic change for outsider CEOs.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite growing interest in the board of directors of entrepreneurial firms, the role of outside board members in high tech start-ups has been largely neglected. This dearth of research is surprising since the high level of resource dependency these ventures face is likely to heighten the potential contribution outside board members can make. We argue that, for high tech start-ups, the service role the board plays will be crucial in overcoming resource dependencies. In contrast to existing studies that tie the outside boards' servicing role to board characteristics, we propose that greater attention needs to be paid to the resource profile of the venture. Building on resource dependency theory, we find that the extent to which the outside board members fulfil a service role is dependent on the initial human, financial and technological resource base of the entrepreneurial venture. Specifically, we find that ventures with less diversified teams, teams with lower levels of R&D experience and higher levels of financial experience and ventures earlier in the technological development process receive higher levels of support from the outside board.

This paper investigates the impact of diversity on corporate philanthropy. Compared to previous studies that have considered the influence of board diversity and CEO gender on corporate philanthropy, this study introduces the concept of operational diversity, which is the implementation of diversity programs at management, employee, and supply chain levels, and further, it explains why operational diversity influences corporate philanthropy, by using the premises of resource dependence theory. Second, this study also investigates the influence of board diversity on corporate philanthropy. Third, this study uses a large sample of U.S. firms over the period of 1991-2009 and tries to mitigate possible omitted variables and endogeneity problems that are often overlooked in previous research. We demonstrate that firms with operational diversity programs are likely more dependent on a broad variety of resources and give more to community as a strategic maneuver; hence, operational diversity is a better indicator for predicting future corporate giving than board diversity alone. However, having a woman or a member of a minority as a company's chief executive officer is not sufficient to impact its charitable giving. A battery of robustness tests support our conclusion and confirm that our results are not driven by a firm's general corporate social responsibility (CSR) score, gender or independence of board members, or firm ownership. This paper will assist researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders in deepening their understanding of the predictors of corporate giving. (c) 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study investigated how female directors of corporate boards of directors (BoD) experience boardroom dynamics. The study represents an initial research trend that moves from a unilateral focus on financial outcomes of female representation in BoDs toward stronger attention on the social dynamics in the boardroom. Drawing on social identity theory, the study proposed that female directors often constitute an out-group within the BoD, preventing them from experiencing positive board dynamics. More specifically, the study explored the extent to which female directors do experience less justice, lower cohesion, and higher levels of conflicts within the BoD than their male counterparts do. Moreover, we assumed that female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds would be particularly likely to experience negative boardroom dynamics whereas female chairpersons of BoDs would perceive boardroom dynamics more positively than other female directors. The sample consisted of 491 directors from 149 BoDs. Our findings revealed that there were generally few differences in the way female and male directors experienced boardroom dynamics and female chairpersons of BoDs did not perceive the dynamics differently than other female directors. Female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds perceived the boardroom dynamics somewhat more negatively than other female directors, but the differences were not statistically significant. The conclusions from this study are that there are reasons to believe that female directors are welcomed into boardrooms, not perceived as out-groups, and BoDs are able to benefit from the female directors' experience and skills.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

The objective of this paper is to determine the managerial governance characteristics related to financial distress companies. The boards failed to accomplish their monitoring duties, which seemed to be one of the main reasons behind the actual financial distress and bankruptcy that swept the companies across the planet. Through the analysis of a sample of 178 Lebanese non listed and owned family firms, the results showed that the boards (that have a higher proportion of outside directors) are less inclined to face a financial distress than the boards with a lower proportion. Besides, a different conclusion proves that the board's size and financial distress are directly linked. The paper highlights the extent to which financial distress is associated with corporate governance from a Euro Mediterranean country. It would be a source of education to Lebanese investors who excessively go for short-term returns and of help for regulatory authorities in the framework of making policies on corporate governance reformation.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

Purpose-Nowadays, social and environmental reporting is approached in different ways, paths and fields by either large-, small-, or mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). However, as demonstrated by previous scholars, SMEs have been critically discussed because they provide lack of proper sustainability disclosure. The fact that the predominant approach of SMEs toward social responsibility is often "sunken" and not "explicit" can drive the lack of disclosure. Furthermore, unstructured communication practices create difficulties in measuring and reporting the sustainability reporting phenomenon in SMEs. The aim of our study is to shed light on the activity of SMEs' sustainability reporting and disclosure, specifically, by addressing the variables that influence the choice of the guidelines used to prepare sustainability reports. Design/methodology/approach-The research has been carried out by using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The empirical evidence is based on all the Italian companies, mostly SMEs, that were certified in 2011 as having adopted both environmental (i.e., ISO14001 or EMAS) and social (i.e., SA8000) management systems. A multivariate linear regression model has been developed to address the influence of several variables (i.e., financial performance, size, time after achievement of the certifications, group/conglomerate control, etc.) on the guidelines' choice for preparing sustainability reports. Findings-Our findings demonstrate that SMEs prefer to use simple guidelines such as those guidelines that are mandatory under management system certifications. However, the sustainability disclosure driven by the adoption of international guidelines may be more complex if the SME is controlled within a group of companies or if a significant amount of time has passed since the certification date. As such, we developed a taxonomy of their different behavioral drivers according to a legitimacy theory approach. Research limitations-At this stage, our study didn't focus on the contents' quality of the disclosure and reporting practices adopted by SMEs, which is obviously a worthwhile and important area for further research. Furthermore, the analysis took into account the impact of a number of easily accessible variables; therefore, it can be extended to investigate the effect on disclosure of other relevant variables (i.e., nature of the board of directors, age, and industrial sector in which the company operates) as well as contexts prevailing in other countries. Practical implications-The study represents an important contribution for understanding how and why managers might use externally focused disclosure on social and environmental issues to benefit the company's legitimacy. Social implications-Our study provides interesting insights for policy makers who require social or environmental certification when calling for tenders or specific EU contracts, in order to put aside the "brand" or "symbol" and really focus on the disclosed practices. Originality/value-Previous studies have provided only a few evidence about reporting practices and related influencing features of SMEs' sustainability actions. As such, the study wishes to make a significant contribution to the existing literature on Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) by providing relevant insights about the factors which influence the guidelines used by SMEs in preparing their sustainability reports.

Purpose: If proficient boards result in better governance, as the literature on the subject generally suggests, engaging independent directors and having in place an effective audit committee would certainly facilitate productive corporate functioning and enhanced accountability. Motivated by such a viewpoint, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the reporting quality and performance of the Indian central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and its private counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The well premeditated propositions of the study resulted in a final sample comprising 47 CPSEs and 30 peer companies. The auditors' report on financial statements was scanned to determine the quality of company's accounting and financial reporting systems. The BSE-500 Index companies were ranked on select financial parameters to gauge relative performance of the sample companies. Findings: An analysis of the CPSEs shows that non-compliance with the corporate governance provisions with regards to the required number of independent directors on the board did not have any concomitant effect on their performance. Further, an examination of auditors' report revealed that the CPSEs provide a better insight into books of accounts, unlike the private sector. Originality/value: The study is timely and relevant, given the expanded role of the state and renewed interest in boards. A case for collaborative engagement between the government and the corporate sector is proposed to address legal as well as regulatory lacunae for building trust and fostering good corporate governance. To ensure better compliance and enforcement of financial regulations it envisions an integrated accounting/auditing and taxation administration platform. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Ethical issues have received growing attention recently, after corporate scandals and during the current economic crisis. Several initiatives have been adopted to restore confidence and trust in businesses, such as ethics codes. In addition, as a result of those scandals and financial frauds, several rules have focused on the role played by Boards of Directors in the planning and monitoring of codes of ethics. However, the empirical evidence is still scarce and needs some degree of extension. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of several corporate governance features-particularly, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-on the decision of developing an ethics code, among Spanish companies. Our main findings point out the lack of influence of the CEO's characteristics (except for CEO reputation) on the likelihood of having a corporate code, indicating that this decision has to do with a choice made by the company overall, perhaps because of regulatory reasons or stakeholders' expectations. Also, we have checked how other variables, such as the extent of a firm's participation in defence or other government contracts or multiple listings of the company in different financial markets, can influence the decision of developing an ethics code.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This study focuses on the role of the corporate board of directors and the relationship between the dynamics of board structure and the financial performance of listed South African companies. The research results found that the proportion of independent non-executive directors had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share and enterprise value, but had no significant effect on Tobin's Q ratio. Board ownership had a significant negative correlation with firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The number of directors serving on the corporate board had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The study suggests that greater independent non-executive director representation, lower board share-ownership and larger board sizes should be encouraged to enhance firm performance.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

This study seeks to trace dimensions through which corporate governance characteristics influence the financial performance of family owned businesses. Between the periods of 2009-2011, we examined 160 Lebanese family owned firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group. Using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance, we found evidence of the attribute of boards' composition to firm's failure; the presence of outside directors seemed to have no role in the financial distress and insider ownership decrease the likelihood of financial distress but CEO duality increases the same probability of family owned firms in Lebanon. Our findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators toward the implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance in one of the pillars of every local economy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors play important roles in private clubs, especially in member-owned clubs. Resource dependence framework views the club board as an important provider of resources, knowledge, and support. Using a sample of 286 general managers (GMs) and chief operating officers (COOs), this study examined the relationships among a club's board development program, the GMs'/COOs' perception of board performance, and the GMs'/COOs' satisfaction with the boards of directors. This study also found that a second-order three-factor model of club board performance, consisting of strategies and policy making, external relations, and stewardship, was the best fit to the data. All hypotheses from the proposed model were supported, showing that a board development program influenced club board performance directly. Board performance also had direct and positive influence on the GMs'/COOs' satisfaction with the board. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is growing convergence of corporate governance and corporate social responsibility due to increasing business performance pressures and escalating stakeholder expectations of the firm and board of directors. This union encourages director influence on the firm's CSR agenda through stakeholder engagement, active participation in strategy, board-management relationships, and integrated financial, operational, and sustainability performance reporting. This study considers the experience of seven US public company boards to determine factors that may advance board involvement and impact in corporate social responsibility.

We examine the valuation of biotechnology firms and measure firm value relative to the firms' drug development pipelines, alliances with other firms, and the varied composition of those firms' boards of directors. Unsurprisingly, the advancement of drugs in the pipeline is associated with increased valuation, and the failure of drugs in testing is found to have negative impacts. Our findings do not support the notion that companies engaged in partnerships or alliances have better performance. Extending prior research, we find that the presence of medical doctors on the boards of directors is significantly positively associated with price-to-book ratios and firm value. Drug approvals seemed less likely for small cap firms; this outcome is likely the result of small cap firms with more promising prospects being acquired, and exiting "small cap" status. Smaller firms have lower approval rates - they have fewer drugs in the pipeline - and the risk of these smaller firms is diversified when they are combined with larger firms whose research is spread across many more drugs. We observe a higher number of drug approvals for AIDS and cancer. We also discover a modestly higher approval rate alongside a higher proportion of financiers - such as hedge fund managers and investment bankers - on biotechnology boards. The investor might use our discoveries to better project a firm's success in drug approvals and equity returns; the biotech manager could use our findings to better anticipate market responses to changes in the company's board or research; the regulator could remember to limit the political influences on drug approvals by recalling the potential "favoring" of one disease over another depending upon the political climate. Thus our findings are important to the investor, the biotechnology manager and the regulator.

The recent systemic crisis that has affected the financial markets and real economies of major industrialized countries has had significant effects on the corporate governance and key organizational choices of large firms. In this context, the present study aims to verify whether the international crisis has significantly changed the structure of the interlocking directorate network that links large firms in the regulated Italian market. To this end, the first part of the paper presents an analysis of the evolution of corporate governance in the main European regulated markets through a comparative analysis of some synthetic statistical data observed at the end of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010. In the second part, after framing the concept of interlocking directorate in a theoretical perspective, we examine the evolution of the network of personal ties between large Italian listed companies in the period of observation (2006-2010) using Social Network Analysis.

This study proposes a new determinant of executive pay dispersion by integrating two distinct mechanisms: inter-firm diffusion and intra-firm adaptation. Based on institutional theory (diffusion) and group development framework (adaptation), we assess the similarity between the pay dispersion change at executive compensation committee members' tied firm (i.e., where they serve as executives) and that at their focal firm (i.e., where they serve as board of directors). Using a panel sample of U.S. banks, we find the evidence of "diffusion" such that the change (either increase or decrease) of executive pay dispersion at their tied firms results in the change of pay dispersion at the focal firm in the following year. We also find the evidence of "adaptation" such that the extent to which pay dispersion practices are diffused across firms is contingent upon the length of shared tenure among committee members.

Cooperatives are expected to help generate economic growth; become competitive business entities; remain as effective self-help organizations and uphold sensitivity towards the environment. However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth, 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between board composition and financial vulnerability of non-profit organizations in Malaysia. Information on these variables is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 205 societies registered with Registrar of Societies in Malaysia for the financial period 2010. Results of this study revealed significant relationships between some board compositions and some measures of financial vulnerabilities. First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations. In addition, the findings also provide useful information that can facilitate screening, monitoring, and decision making processes for various stakeholders.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of media pressure on external directors in relation to disclosure of information on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a multilevel approach, integrating the institutional, organisational and individual levels of analysis in a whole model that explains corporate transparency. The paper uses a sample composed of 98 non-financial listed Spanish companies for the period 2004-2010, Findings: The results show heterogeneity between external board members. Proprietary directors, representing shareholders, tend to promote adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines in order to increase value for shareholders. On the contrary, independent directors are risk adverse in relation to the effect that CSR information disclosure could have on their professional reputations. Research limitations/implications: The sample could be improved, including companies from different countries and more years for the analysis, since the period studied comprises a particular economic setting (2008-2010), a global financial crisis. Practical implications: Although these results from the Spanish context, the authors recommend that regulatory bodies incorporate provisions into good governance codes that guarantee the existence of quality and comparable CSR information that favours stakeholders' decision taking. Originality/value: The image that society has about a company comes from the opinions created from the mass media. The arguments proposed by agenda-setting theory can be managed by companies as a strategic mechanism to respond to society expectations. At present, two of the most studied aspects are the ethical and sustainable behaviours of organisations. These aspects are related to the characteristics of boards of directors, especially to external directors. Independent directors may disagree with disclosing information about CSR practices because they fear that this information would affect their professional reputations, since they are not specialised in these topics. However, proprietary directors favour the disclosure of this information in an attempt to reduce the cost of capital and risk perceived by investors, especially in more sustainable companies.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of relational pluralism as a collective construct. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between internal governance structure and financial performance of listed Spanish companies. The effectiveness of the board of directors is analyzed through the use of different variables: size, composition, duality, number of annual meetings and busyness of the directors. The financial performance is measured by return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q. Design/methodology/approach - Our study is addressed through the use of a multi-theoretical approach followed by an empirical analysis. Schematic literature review serves as a basis for setting our hypotheses. We conduct the empirical part of the study by applying these to the listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange. An econometric model (multiple regression) is used to test the relation between board structure and financial performance. Findings - Empirical: We conclude that in the three estimated models, two of the dependent variables, ROE and ROA, have an explanatory value. The relationship between the number of the boards of directors' meetings and performance has proved to be negative. Theoretical: Ample literature on corporate governance leads to two conclusions: First, corporative-financial relations must be studied by a multi-theoretical approach. Second, future research must be made only on specific studies coincident with the majority of their characteristics (country, type of firm, type of statistical model [...]). Research limitations/implications - Future research will try to cover gaps, expanding this study in both space and time. Practical implications - The number of Spanish companies' boards meetings is very high. As shown in our study, holding more than one meeting a month does not guarantee greater financial returns; the board can effectively establish its strategic lines of business by meeting up to 12 times per year. Social implications - The results show a negative relationship between ROE and the number of meetings, which may be linked to the country's business culture, which traditionally has a higher number of annual meetings when compared to neighboring countries. Perhaps, this is an indicative symptom of the inefficiency associated with the Spanish system. Originality/value - Theoretical review is performed with two aims: first, to establish our research hypotheses, and second, to reflect on future research by fine-tuning the abundant previous studies.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

Research on the composition of the board of directors of DMOs as well as the governance of DMOs is of particular interest for destination management, because it helps understand the context of community-type tourist destinations. There is an increasing body of research on the composition and roles of DMO boards of directors as well as the duties and tasks of those individuals. However, to date, no study has addressed their influence on the financial revenues of the organization. A DMO's budget is not God-given but evolves along with the development of the organizations and the institutions in the destinations. Thus, we investigate to what extent directors on the boards affect the amount from different revenue sources. Using data from 44 Swiss local and regional DMOs, we perform seven distinct multiple regressions with the following revenue sources as dependent variables: (1) membership fees, (2) partnership platforms/initiatives, (3) commercial revenues, (4) overnight taxes, (5) regional and state subsidies, (6) municipal subsidies, and (7) tourism taxes. Four independent variables (1) stakeholders, (2) public agents, (3) leaders, and (4) networkers, positively and negatively affect the revenue sources. The results reveal two contrasting roles: while leaders and networkers likely increase the revenue sources, stakeholder representatives and public agents negatively affect the revenue sources. Additionally, the latter two functions strongly increase the size of the DMOs' boards. We conclude with a new perspective on how to understand DMO boards, their functions, and finally the organizations themselves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For the last two decades, board diversity is increasingly considered as a significant mechanism of good corporate governance. Thus, the question arises whether a heterogeneously or rather a homogenously composed board contributes to the efficiency of a company's management and monitoring. Especially national and international regulators and standard setters consider board diversity to be associated with an increasing firm performance. Therefore, the economic impact of board diversity aspects needs to be investigated empirically. This study examines the relationship between diversity within management boards and corporate performance for the German two-tier system by presenting a comprehensive literature analysis as well as an empirical analysis based on 149 publicly listed German organizations for the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Hence, management board diversity is characterized by attributes, such as gender, age, nationality and functionality. An analysis comparable to the one at hand including multiple dimensions for German companies has not been performed, yet. We mostly find negative effects of various board diversity characteristics on corporate performance, especially regarding age and national diversity. This may be due to the fact that great internationality on boards can decrease communication between board members and large age differences may alleviate decision-making processes.

In this article, we conduct a longitudinal study of women's progress on French corporate boards of directors. We particularly focus on the extent to which women directors have circumvented the glass ceiling. Using a sample of SBF 120 companies over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009, our results provide evidence of a significant increase in the number of women on French corporate boards. However, the corporate glass ceiling hypothesis is consistently rejected whatever the considered measure of female directors; i.e., the number of board seats held by women, the number of firms with a critical mass of female directors, and the number of directorships held by each women director.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the research in this field on the portrayal of women and the effect this has on boards and corporate image, as well as to propose a theoretical framework for further research on the effects of media stereotypes. The theoretical model aims to analyze the media's effect on female board members, and how this helps in the process of changing stereotypes or whether it consolidates existing preconceptions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the existing literature on the subject and proposes a theoretical model for future research, contributing thus in opening a new line of research in the field of the roles of women on boards. Findings: The conclusions reached will have important consequences for the future of women on boards in relation to three fundamental issues: the types of women that join boards of directors, the type of female profile companies search for and the roles women are expected to play on those boards. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institution to reflect on potential gender biases. Practical implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institutions and media agents to reflect on potential gender biases. Originality/value: An important body of literature already exists showing how the portrayal of women can reinforce or eliminate barriers to access membership of a board of directors. There is also a solid body of literature showing the media's effect on transmitting or changing preconceived ideas about women in business, as well as the potential impact of appointing them - through the influence of different stakeholders - on a company's image. However, there has been little substantial research carried out on the media's effect on gender diversity on boards. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study is an attempt to achieve the main objective by examining the association between the board of director's characteristics, audit committee characteristics and the executive committee characteristics and the performance of the Oman companies. This study used many assumptions to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable as discussed in the section explaining the study method. The data comprised of 162 non-financial companies because financial and non-financial companies employ different methods and they have different structures. As this study attempts to bridge the gap in the existing literature by investigating the association between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance in the emerging market of Oman, it focuses on adding new important variables of corporate governance mechanisms like board change, the role of secretary on the board, the legal counsel and the executive committee characteristics that improve firm performance. The findings indicated a significantly positive relationship between board size, board meeting, audit committee independence and executive committee independence, and the Tobin's Q. On the other hand, board independence and legal counsel are significantly and negatively related to Tobin's Q. Moreover, a positive but insignificant relationship is found between CEO tenure, CEO compensation, audit committee size, and the firm performance (Tobin's Q). Furthermore, board change, the role of the secretary on the board, audit committee meeting, executive committee size and executive committee meeting are revealed to have a negative but insignificant association with firm performance (Tobin's Q). Finally, this study provides recommendations for future research.

An initial public offering (IPO) represents one of the final stages in the life of a small firm as it transitions from private to public. In this paper the experience of directors is examined to determine the extent of the role they play in ensuring a successful listing. Unique data from 122 IPOs on the Swedish Stock Exchange have been examined in a search for the effect of director experience on aftermarket performance. Specific aspects of director experience within a board, such as interlocking directorships and average tenure, are connected to the underpricing of Swedish IPOs. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant relationship was found between long-run aftermarket performance and director experience at the time of an IPO. This suggests that the previous experience of directors, as measured in earlier studies, is less relevant to long-term aftermarket performance in Sweden compared to other countries studied in the literature review. This emphasises the importance of examining different institutional contexts. (c)2014 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

There is a growing global interest in social responsibility and sustainability across all sectors. Other than economic performance, stakeholders are now also concerned about the social and environmental impacts of corporations. Additionally, stakeholders are obtaining a higher salience level and expect organisations to operate sustainably. The banking sector has not been an exception, as banks can have significant impact on their customers, employees, and society in various ways. Given the intertwined links of Islam and ethical principles, it is expected that Islamic banks will show a high level of commitment towards social responsibility (SR) and ethical practices. The current study investigates this issue by examining the annual reports of three fully-fledged Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia over the period of 2007 to 2011. It was found that only two of the investigated banks had continuous improvement in their SR disclosure. Additionally, it was revealed that the highest disclosures have been for 'corporate vision' and 'board of directors and top management', while the lowest disclosures were evident for 'environment' and 'product, services and fair dealing with supply chain'.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study aims to examine the relationship between multiple directorships and the monitoring role of the board of directors in Malaysian listed companies (PLC). The monitoring role is proxied by the percentage of directors' attendance in board meetings, as attending meetings provides directors with resources about the management actions and assists directors to exercise their role effectively. The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.

This study analyses the influence of board composition on companies' innovation in the Spanish corporate governance system. Drawing from a multi-theoretical perspective, the analysis shows the moderating effect of board member stock ownership on the relationship between board composition and innovation. Using secondary data from a sample of Spanishquoted companies in technology industries over the 2003-2005 period, the findings demonstrate that board composition influences the innovative behaviour of firms, and that this influence is also conditioned by directors' stock ownership because directors' attitude towards innovation could vary depending on their power and on how many shares they own. These results confirm that innovation increases in firms whose boards have a high proportion of affiliated directors with significant stock ownership. This study also makes some important contributions towards creating a more effective board that can shape companies' strategic orientation, highlighting the need to consider the joint impact of board composition and ownership concentration.

One important pre-requisite for the functioning of supervisory boards is the selection of adequate members. Accordingly, corporate governance codes recommend the professionalisation of the board selection process through the establishment of nomination committees. These committees should carry out two principal tasks: 1) drawing up appropriate requirement profiles; 2) rationally structuring the selection process. Analysing in-depth interviews with 27 nomination committees' members of twelve German supervisory boards, we show that not all nomination committees fulfil these tasks satisfactorily; sometimes they merely act symbolically and rationalise decisions already taken by CEOs or main shareholders ex-post. Overall we succeed in identifying three prototypical nomination committees - active, consultative, and box-ticking - and show their impact on the board selection process.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how networks of boards of directors affect relative performance evaluation (RPE) in chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors propose that an interlocking network is an important inter-corporate setting, which has a bearing on whether boards decide to use RPE in CEO compensation. They adopt four typical graph measures to depict the centrality/position of each board in the interlock network: degree, betweenness, eigenvector and closeness, and study their impacts on RPE use. Findings - The authors find that firms that have more connected board members and whose board members are connected to better connected firms are more likely to reward their CEOs contingent on their peers' performance, indicating that information transmission along the board interlock network facilitates the adoption of RPE. This result is robust to alternative measures for board interlock networks and various types of CEO compensation. It highlights the role of interlocking directorates in disseminating information and practice of RPE use along board network. Originality/value - The authors use social network analysis to measure the relationships and flows between the connected nodes and study the impact on executive compensation design.

This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Franchising brings a unique set of challenges to human resources and organization development (HROD) practitioners who are focused on strategically aligning human capacity and organizational goals through cultures of collaboration. Because franchising consists of inter-firm relationships, the presence of franchise associations can help ensure that franchisee voices are heard and that collaborative relationships exist between the franchisor and franchisees. These franchise associations typically use governance structures, which includes elected boards of directors. Although practitioner data delineate the roles these franchise boards should perform, there has been only limited empirical investigation on the topic. Moreover, no research addresses how to foster productive relationships between the franchisees and franchisors who work together in these board relationships. This article presents a proposed framework for these boards, using a multi-theoretical perspective that addresses the competing emphases affecting the franchisor-franchisee relationship and the respective roles for HROD professionals.

The debate around corporate governance has been particularly vigorous in this part of the 21st century. Theoretical frameworks have been tested by spectacular corporate failures that also raise questions as to the effectiveness of different approaches. Empirical, contextually-based research into how governance theory informs practice assists in understanding these questions. This paper explores findings from empirical research conducted into the make-up of boards of directors in New Zealand, an export focused economy dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. These findings are revealing in demonstrating that despite the challenges faced by the New Zealand industry in a volatile global environment, the skill-sets and other characteristics present in, and sought from, directors appear to be both narrow and traditional. However, there is also evidence to suggest shifting expectations and requirements are to some extent and will continue to propel change in both boards and in contributions expected of individual directors.

The focus of this study was to examine the effect of ownership structure and the independent board chair as the moderating variable on the performance of companies in the finance industry of the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia. The study used a total of 185 observation data collected from 37 finance companies from the years 2007 to 2011. The results of the study showed that the independent board chair as the moderating variable had a negative relationship with the finance companies' Tobin's Q value. The literature advocates that the independent board chair has an influence on the monitoring of owner managers and in safeguarding minority shareholders' economic interest. On the other hand independent chair control and monitoring of company decisions can be affected by the dominant voice of the CEO, the majority presence of executive directors, the presence of owner manager and leverage.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the cognitive as well as the disciplinary role of one important governance mechanism that is the board of directors in a privatization context. Using a sample of privatized French companies, we examine the relationship between the size, component and structure of this mechanism to the performance and value creation on the post privatization period. Thus, the majority of our findings have support on the theory of cognitive governance, one aspect of governance that was ignored in previous research.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

This study investigates the relationship between two governance issues, i.e., ownership and board structure of Malaysian listed firms (between 2010 and 2012) and their performance in terms of profitability, liquidity and gearing. Structural Equation Modeling is applied and the data analysis tool used is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The dependent variables used as proxies for financial performance are; profitability, liquidity and gearing, whilst the independent variables are; ownership retention (OR), board size (BS), percentage of executive directors (ED), percentage of independent directors (ID) and percentage of non-independent non-executive directors (NINED). It is conjectured that there is consistency across all components of ownership and board structure in terms of its relationship with the gearing of companies. With the exception of non-independent non-executive directors, all other components of board structure in this study seem to have an impact on the gearing of companies. In that respect, it can be concluded that a company's ownership structure and board of directors who represent the shareholders have major concerns on the gearing of companies compared to other financial indicators, as the level of gearing of a company has important and long-lasting effects on the profitability and liquidity of companies. This study leads the path for further research on all aspects of a company's gearing. (c) the author(s).

Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a "professional board" of directors. The authors utilize state-of-the-art academic literature from the fields of corporate governance and organizational behavior to evaluate the merits and de-merits of the proposed corporate governance model, and present their findings (and recommendations) for improvements in corporate governance practices.

The European Commission has recently proposed the introduction of legally binding quotas for women on corporate boards of European companies. This proposal has put the spotlight on the question of whether increasing female representation on the board brings economic benefits to the firm. In order to shed light on the issue, this study investigates the direct and indirect effects of women on the board on firm value. We use a simultaneous equation model to estimate the effects of women on the board on firm value, financial performance, and compliance with ethical and social principles adopted by the firm. We find no evidence that a higher female representation on the board directly affects firm's value. However, we find indirect effects. Women on the board are positively related with financial performance (measured in terms of return on assets and return on sales) and with ethical and social compliance, which in turn are positively related with firm value. The findings in this study suggest that greater female representation on corporate boards of large European firms can increase firm value indirectly. Further, part of the indirect effect comes from stronger compliance with ethical principles, something that is not captured by accounting-based financial performance.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

We study whether environmental reporting serves as a transparency tool to communicate sound environmental policies to stakeholders or rather as a manipulation tool of stakeholders' perceptions. In particular, we focus on the relationship between environmental disclosure tone and future environmental performance and we furthermore explore the role of the board of directors' monitoring and stakeholder orientation in shaping this relationship. Using a sample of 288 US oil and gas firms, we find that the bias towards positive language does not reflect purely opportunistic managerial reasons, but rather is a transparency tool to signal future environmental performance. In addition, we document that the stakeholder orientation of the board plays a transparency role in communicating the firm's superior performance. Our findings contribute to the debate on whether discretionary strategies in environmental reporting are more about increased transparency or about stakeholder manipulation. Moreover, they help investors and policymakers to interpret managers' language choices. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper sets out to shed light on female representation on Italian corporate boards before the introduction of gender quota legislation in 2012, as well as on the relevance of family connections. We investigate the potential determinants of having boards with diverse representation and the correlation between female directorship and family connections, with a focus on governance measures. Research Findings: Using data on all directors of Italian publicly traded companies from 2008 to 2010, we identify two different models. In the majority of gender-diverse boards, at least one woman has a family connection to the controlling shareholder. Family-affiliated women are more common in companies that are small, have a concentrated ownership, are in the consumer sector, and have a larger board. Conversely, non-family-affiliated women are more common on the boards of companies that are widely held, have younger and more educated boards, have a higher proportion of independent directors, and have a smaller number of interlocked directors. With reference to governance-related outcomes, the number of board meetings appears to be negatively correlated to both the presence of family members and female directors. Additionally, women show lower attendance than men at board meetings. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper provides support for theories on the differences between the governance of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. Practitioner/Policy Implication: The study offers insights to policymakers implementing gender quota legislation. Substantial effort should be devoted to ensuring that board diversity is associated with actual independence of board members. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In the last few decades, interest in family firms has increased. There are several analyses in relation to leadership, ownership and succession-related topics, but they omit issues related to stakeholders and corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study broadens empirical evidence in this respect. Using a sample composed of internationally listed companies for the period 2003-2009, we analyse CSR information disclosures in family businesses, as well as the fundamental role of the independence of the board in this regard. Our results show that, in general, the higher the proportion of independent directors, the higher the level of CSR information disclosures; but, in the concrete case of family firms, the "independence" of these directors disappeared, thereby reducing the positive association with information disclosure; this was because independent directors may be strongly influenced by family owners, and even by personal or familiar ties.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other "LGBT-friendly" policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We study the relation between the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. We argue that substantial age dissimilarity between the two-giving rise to cognitive conflict-increases board monitoring and firm value for firms with greater monitoring needs. We find evidence for our hypothesis using data on German two-tier boards. German law mitigates endogeneity concerns as it prevents CEO duality and also restricts CEO power in other ways. Additional identification attempts include CEO-firm and chair-firm fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel data estimations, and the use of the 2007 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, when fast decision making and managerial discretion were needed, the link between age dissimilarity and firm value changed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Over the past decade, expectations for more effective oversight of risks by boards of directors have significantly increased. These expectations emanate from stock exchanges, regulators, credit rating agencies and other key stakeholders. Proponents of enhanced risk oversight argue that an increased understanding of enterprise-wide risks provides strategic benefit by helping the board and management identify and manage risks that may impact the achievement of strategic objectives while at the same time helping the board monitor the extent of risk-taking on the part of management in their desire to meet these objectives. In response to these growing expectations, some boards have asked management to explore implementation of a more holistic, top-down approach to risk oversight widely known as enterprise risk management (ERM) while others have not. Institutional theory would suggest that a number of organizations implement minimal elements of ERM for symbolic reasons, lacking substance in risk oversight. In contrast, agency theory would suggest that boards embrace explicit and robust risk oversight activities to monitor management's risk-taking actions, and resource dependence theory would suggest that they also do so to help the organization achieve strategic objectives. Little is known about the way in which boards and management organize their processes and the impact of those processes on the level of ERM adoption. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which ERM is perceived to provide strategic benefit to those organizations that have invested in developing a robust ERM process. Based on data gathered from 645 survey responses from executives of organizations spanning a number of industries and sizes, we find that organizations with greater ERM maturity are significantly more likely to have taken steps to formally engage the board and senior management in specific risk oversight tasks (consistent with agency theory), and certain board and management risk practices are associated with perceptions that ERM provides strategic advantage (consistent with resource dependence theory).

From the perspective of agency, resource-based view, and resource-dependence theories, we explore the impact of the presence of outside directors on firm performance in family small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs). Using survey data from 369 Spanish family SMEs, our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of outsiders on the boards of first- and second-generation family firms and firm performance. The results show that a balanced presence of outside directors contributes to value creation in family SMEs and confirm that the composition and the roles of the board of directors differ from generation to generation in family firms.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how an environmental threat (possible quotas for female supervisory directors) might change supervisory board gender composition in SBF120 French company boards between 2008 and 2010. Design/methodology/approach - From a census of supervisory board membership of SBF120 companies in France in January 2008 and December 2010, data were obtained to test hypotheses relating to changes in gender composition of boards and demographic differences between new and earlier director appointees. The authors drew on institutional theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. Findings - The authors reveal significant increases over 2008-2010 in SBF120 board female representation and significant cohort differences between recent and earlier appointees. Newer female appointees differed from male peers and from earlier appointed females and males, bringing youth and international experience. New females were more likely to gain CAC40 seats than their male peers. There was an increase in boards with multiple female directors. Research limitations/implications - Actual motivations for increase in female appointments are unknown, but institutional theory provides possible explanations, as suggestion of coercive forces loomed. Chairmen of larger firms may have made strategic choices to attract younger and English-speaking foreign women, before the rush. Limitations include the descriptive nature of the paper, but it sets a benchmark for later studies to monitor progress in depth. Practical implications - The talent pool for female directors has widened to include foreign English-speaking women, bringing a range of new insights and experience of international governance practice to traditional French boardrooms. However, this could be seen as further discriminatory practice that requires female appointees to bring more human and social capital than that required of their male peers. Originality/value - This is the first paper charting the changes in supervisory board composition during the three-year period of environmental unrest as quotas were proposed and legislated in France and comparing new and existing cohort French director demographics.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Scholars and practitioners have been interested in the tasks of boards of directors, yet we know relatively little about the impact of directors' social identification on their engagement in specific board tasks. Examining the 92 largest Finnish industrial organizations, we explore how the directors' identification with the organization, its shareholders, and customers affects the extent to which the board engages in external legitimacy, networking, advice and counsel, top management monitoring, financial monitoring, strategic participation, and strategic evaluation tasks. Research Findings/Insights: Following the social identity perspective, we provide new insight to understand the relationship between board tasks and the directors' relevant identifications. We find that organizational identification is positively related to the level of board task involvement. We also discover that shareholder identification is negatively related to strategic participation tasks and only weakly related to other board tasks. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the present literature on boards of directors by applying an empirical, analytical lens to theories on how and why directors engage in board tasks. In particular, we show that different social identifications of the directors have different explanatory power towards the subsets of resource provision and monitoring tasks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of the shareholder supremacy view as the only driver of value creation for the organization. Additionally, we advocate that board, organization, and industry characteristics are similarly weak in predicting the involvement of the directors in the board tasks examined.

This article presents a review of the studies on on boards of directors and corporate social responsibility practices in the banking industry. Several characteristics of bank boards, in particular independence and diversity, may impact their CSR commitments. By studying a sample of 159 banks in nine countries during the period 2004-2010, there is evidence that suggests that banks with more independent and diverse directors follow a path of socially responsible behaviour.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship of non-financial and financial factors to firm survival, provide evidence of factors related to financial success and distress for prominent Australian agricultural firms, and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes mixed method exploratory case studies across four Australian agricultural firms (two successful and two failed) listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Findings - The authors found that the use of an Integrated Multi-Measured approach provided a higher classification rate for the failed group than those provided by an individual measure. We also discovered that non-financial factors associated with the agricultural organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included managements' involvement in organizational strategy and the composition of the board of directors. It was also apparent that management decision-making approaches may become frozen, or at best restricted, in the face of impending failure, dependent upon the stress level within the organization and the management skill base. Practical implications - The cases studied indicated that non-financial factors of failure occurred prior to any financial predictors, intuitively indicating a relationship between non-financial and financial factors in Australian agricultural firms. Originality/value - The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes which distinguish successful and failing firms can be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

Concentration of ownership in Malaysian public listed companies contributes to agency conflict between majority and minority shareholders. An effective monitoring mechanism is critical to mitigate this conflict. The study aims to examine the influence of board and audit committee independence, internal audit function and ownership concentration on earnings quality proxied by discretionary accruals. The sample of the study 508 companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia Main Market from 2009 to 2012. Two measures of discretionary accruals are used: Modified Jones model (Dechow et al., 1995); and extended Modified Jones Model (Yoon et al., 2006). Using OLS regression, results of the study suggest that audit committee independence and more investment in internal audit function are related to higher earnings quality. However, board of directors' independence and ownership concentration are associated with lower earnings quality. The finding indicates the importance of audit committee independence in producing quality financial reporting. Consistent findings are found for most variables in both models. The findings of the study have implication on the use of measurement of discretionary accruals in earnings quality studies and corporate governance practices in Malaysia.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Board of director member diversity has an impact on the functions each director successfully provides. Appropriate and necessary board member capabilities differ between small and large firms. Although these differences seem apparent, current research has favored studies related to large firms and neglected those related to board member needs of small firms. Grounded in Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, the following manuscript theoretically suggests that firm size moderates the relationship between board member diversity and the two primary functions (monitoring and the provision of resources) of board members. Furthermore, small firms can enhance performance through appropriate member composition in differing ways than large firms. (c) 2015, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objectiveof this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serveon multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider thederivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) whopossesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on theSpanish Continuous Market for the period 2005-2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear(inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relationis only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of linksgenerated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and sharedknowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship. (c) 2015 AEDEM.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

This study investigates the nature of the collaborations of the foreign investor with the local family business groups, drawing out a range of possible implications on performance. Embracing a multi-theoretical approach, we use a panel data regression analysis on a sample of non-financial companies listed in Istanbul Stock Exchange during the period of 1999-2002. We find that the interaction of the foreign investor with local business groups may have both positive and negative consequences on performance, depending on the nature of the collaboration. In the case of local firms, there is a positive relationship between performance and the presence of a chairman who is a member of the family that owns the business group. Having such a chairman seems to have a negative effect on performance when foreign investors are involved. However, equity partnership with a local family business group contributes positively to the performance of foreign-involved companies. (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyzes the effect of directors' human and external social capital on the monitoring and resource provision tasks of the board. Furthermore, this study examines the moderating effect of cognitive and affective conflicts among the directors on these relationships. Based on a sample of 92 cases, we find that the human and external social capital of the directors is positively associated with board's monitoring and resource provision tasks. The results suggest that cognitive conflict positively moderates the relationship between directors' external social capital with the monitoring and negatively with the resource provision tasks. Affective conflict was found to moderate the relationship between directors' external social capital and the resource provision tasks negatively, and positively moderate the relationship between directors' human capital and resource provision tasks. This study suggests that the behavioral perspective, which takes into account the dynamics and interaction in the board, has considerable predictive power. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This book is a helpful reference guide for corporate executives and private equity groups of all types." Neal Aronson, Managing Partner, Roark Capital Group "Business success increasingly depends on effective use of IT. Effective use of IT depends on the kind of in-depth, practical insight in this book. Baschab and Piot provide a pragmatic approach to information systems investment that should be required reading for senior executives and CIOs alike." Erik Brynjolfsson, Schussel Professor of Management, Director of the Center for Digital Business, MIT "This book should provide valuable guidance for management and technology consultants.

Gary J. Fernandes, former vice chairman, EDS, member of the Board of Directors, Computer Associates "Baschab and Piot do a great job of laying out the fundamental issues and challenges that every IT organization faces. More often than not, the issues are not technical in nature, but are a reflection of how the IT and business teams work together to define, execute, and implement new business tools. The threshold issue is leadership. Often it is difficult for business leaders to feel that they have the skills and perspective to provide that leadership on technical projects.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

The relationship between boards of directors and CEOs has been at the center of attention in the literature on Corporate Governance. However, little has been done to identify sources of friction and possible outcomes in this relationship. In this paper, drawing on the literature on Agency/Stewardship Theory, Upper Echelons perspective, and Corporate Governance, I have addressed this gap. To do so, this paper recognizes the distinction between founder and non-founder CEOs and dependent and independent boards of directors. I have hypothesized that founder CEOs will demonstrate higher resistance than non-founder CEOs in the presence of independent boards of directors and lower than non-founder CEOs in the presence of dependent boards of directors to takeover proposals.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

In this paper, we draw on insights from theories in the management and corporate governance literature to develop a theoretical model that makes explicit the links between a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) related board attributes, its board CSR strategy, and its environmental and social performance. We then test the model using structural equation modeling approach. We find that the greater the CSR orientation of the board (as measured by the board's independence, gender diversity, and financial expertise on audit committee), the more proactive and comprehensive the firm's CSR strategy, and the higher its environmental and social performance. Moreover, we find this link to be endogenous and self-reinforcing, with superior CSR performers tending to further strengthen their board CSR orientation. This result while positive is also suggestive of the widening of the gap between the leads and laggards in CSR. Therefore, the question arises as to how 'leaders' are using their superior CSR competencies seen by many scholars as a source of corporate (at times unfair) competitive advantage. Stakeholders of corporations therefore need to be cognizant of this aspect of CSR when evaluating a firm's CSR activities. Policy makers also need to be cognizant of these concerns when designing regulation in this field. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance on firm performance for a large representative sample. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical analysis focuses on a large number of companies covering 20 important industries of the Indian manufacturing sector for the period 2001-2010. Several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes, including system generalized methods of moments, which effectively overcomes the problem of endogeneity and simultaneity bias. Findings: On one side, the findings indicate that larger boards are associated with a greater depth of intellectual knowledge, which in turn helps in improving decision-making and enhancing the performance. On the other side, the results indicate that return on equity and profitability is not related to corporate governance indicators. The results also suggest that CEO duality is not related to any firm performance measures for the sample firms. Practical implications: The outcomes of the analyses advocated that companies that comply with good corporate governance practices can expect to achieve higher accounting and market performance. It implies that good corporate governance practices lead to reduced agency costs. Hence, it is concluded that firms of the developing world can possibly enhance their performance by implementing good corporate governance practices. Originality/value: Departing from the conventional system of the prior studies and instead of focusing on a single measure framework, a range of measures of corporate governance and firm's performance variables are used. Also, several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes. Furthermore, the sample also covers a large sample of manufacturing firms.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

Purpose-This paper aims to examine the relationship between corporate governance, in particular board diversity, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting among the top 150 listed companies in Australia over a three-year period. Design/methodology/approach-The quantitative analysis involving a longitudinal study is used where content analysis is undertaken to analyse the extent of CSR disclosures in annual reports. Regression analysis using panel data is used to analyse the potential association between CSR disclosure and five important board diversity measures, specifically independence, tenure, gender, multiple directorships and overall diversity measure. Findings-The results based on the regression analysis reveal that three of the board diversity attributes (gender, tenure and multiple directorships) and the overall diversity measure have the potential to influence CSR reporting. The relationship between independent/non-executive directors and CSR disclosure however is unclear. In addition, three of the control variables (firm size, industry and CEO duality) are found to have some influence on CSR disclosure, whereas board size and profitability are found to be insignificant. The results also indicate the existence of some possible interaction effects between gender and multiple directorships. Originality/value-The paper has implications for companies, for policymakers and for the professional development needs of board members. Australian companies should consider identifying board attributes that enhance CSR disclosures, as it has been shown in previous studies that CSR disclosure in Australia is low when compared to other developed countries. Moreover, given that there is such limited research linking board diversity and CSR disclosure, the results of this paper provide scope for further research. Moreover the paper contributes to the existing literature on board composition and CSR disclosure by extending the literature to board diversity and provides preliminary evidence of the influence of board diversity on CSR disclosure in Australia.

Purpose: This study aims to include two primary goals. First to determine the board characteristics of listed companies in Turkey and second to investigate the effect of board gender diversity on the performance of these companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an instrumental variables regression analysis to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance using the data from 2008-2012 of the entities listed on the Borsa Istanbul. Findings: The results indicate that the boards of these companies in Turkey are male-dominated. Moreover, this study shows that the inclusion of female directors is positively related to the financial performance of firms, as measured by the return on assets, the return on equity and the return on sales. Originality/value: Limited empirical studies have been conducted on the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance in emerging economies. Therefore, there is still no consensus regarding the link between board gender diversity and firm financial performance based upon the mixed and sometimes contradictory results in prior research. Therefore, this study extends the current literature in the context of Turkey, showing that a female member on the board can enhance the financial performance of a company.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we aim to study the impact on dividends policy of gender diversity on the board of directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the contribution of intellectual capital (IC) of the board of directors (BDs) in generating IC of a company, to develop a definition of the IC of the BDs, as well as two of its major elements: human capital (knowledge, skills, and experience of board members, etc.), and social capital (relationships and networking opportunities of board members), and to clarify the relationship between these elements and financial performance indicators of companies based on a literature review on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and analysis was applied as this study's research design. Findings: The authors suggest that IC is generated not only by company staff, but also by governing bodies, particularly the BDs, whose members are not always under contract with the company in the traditional sense. Members of the board use their knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities to build IC for effective monitoring, advising, and providing the company with resources. In this sense, the BDs serves as a source of IC for a company, being the main internal corporate governance mechanism that leads to value creation in a company, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders. Practical implications: The research indicates that the personal characteristics of board members may influence the performance of a company. Therefore, companies should be recommended to carefully select candidates for nomination to the board. Originality/value: This study contributes to further development of the concept of IC of the BDs by bringing together the theory in the field and the empirical results of studies on the various elements of board capital in a company's value creation.

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

This study examines the remuneration of non-executive directors, examining individual monitoring characteristics and director capital in addition to firm characteristics. Using a large sample of FTSE All-Share non-executive directors from 2001 to 2012, we find that remuneration is positively linked to both directors' individual characteristics and firm characteristics. We find that director age, tenure, and network size are positively related to remuneration, suggesting that directors' ability to contribute to board decision-making and their set of resources are valued by firms. We find that director remuneration is negatively related to monitoring characteristics such as director independence, suggesting possible agency considerations, as effective monitors of top management are paid less. However, director ownership has a non-linear relationship with remuneration, and is substitutive at higher levels of ownership. We also observe that UK boards are relatively homogeneous, with few female directors and even fewer Chairmen, and find strong evidence of a gender gap in remuneration when examining inter- and intra-firm variations. Our findings have implications for regulators who seek to intervene in board appointments, as they indicate that firms do not necessarily value or reward resources brought by female or independent directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on the participation of women on Boards of Directors (BD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a body of literature (theoretical and empirical words) that analyzes the women's role on the BD of companies. The review allows the authors to bring together the theoretical foundations and the empirical findings of studies that have examined the influence of the engagement of women on BD on the business outcomes of the firms involved. Findings - There is no agreement on the results relating to the effect of the presence of women on these boards. Moreover, there is no well-defined theoretical basis to explain this relationship, making it necessary to use a multi-theoretical approach. Research limitations/implications - This study could be extended by including investigations of the intermediate variable between the composition of the BD and the business outcomes, thus enabling an analysis of the effects of different organizational variables on the economic and financial variables already studied. In addition, the authors propose a comparative study between different countries and between different kinds of companies. Originality/value - This paper highlights the controversy that exists over the significance of the involvement of women on the BD of companies. It also proposes the development of new lines of research to attempt to answer some of the questions that are raised by the diverse findings reported in the literature.

We study the effect of board size on firm value in Australia. Using a large sample of Australian firms over the period 2001-2011, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship. We show that firms with a large board are associated with CEO compensation that is sensitive to firm size, but not to firm performance. This incentive to accumulate assets is congruent with the fact that firms with a large board also exhibit lower operating performance and higher operating costs. Furthermore, we find that the effect of board size is stronger in small firms. This result might explain why earlier studies, which focused on large Australian firms, found board size to have little impact on firm value. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the current research on corporate philanthropy and organizational outcomes by empirically exploring two specific types of antecedents: board of director composition and industry membership. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework was developed based on the resource dependence and stakeholder theories which suggest that the extent that firms build relationship with certain stakeholders is closely tied to the personal and social background of board members, in turn influencing the allocation of resources to corporate philanthropy. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis as well as analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons was conducted using multi-year data philanthropic data from 104 US corporations. Findings - The results provided empirical support for a positive relationship between the number of female board directors and the level of corporate philanthropy. In addition, the results showed significant inter-industry variations in the level of corporate philanthropy. This indicated that the rather aggressive role of philanthropy in mitigating reputational challenges associated with product-market dysfunctions. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, the results did not support a positive relationship between the proportion of outside directors and level of philanthropy. Research limitations/implications - The authors believe the empirical finding on the relationship between industry membership and corporate philanthropy is a significant contribution to the philanthropy literature. Accordingly, by empirically showing the disproportionately higher level of philanthropy by some prominent industries (such as gas and oil, financial services and chemical) than their counterparts, the authors contribute to the understanding of sector-level determinants of corporate philanthropy. Practical implications - Since board of directors have a direct involvement in reviewing and approving major corporate initiatives, the choice of these directors is more likely to influence the amount of resources committed to philanthropic causes. Consistent with other studies in the larger corporate social responsibility research, the authors found that more women directors on the board are associated with greater philanthropic spending. Hence, a major implication of the study is that shareholders and the general corporate community need to pay close attention into who is elected to serve as director of business organizations as these directors' background and experience could shape major social responsibility initiatives such as corporate philanthropy. Originality/value - By empirically investigating the relationship between board composition and philanthropy, this study extends the scholarly discussion to focus on the role of the board in shaping the level of firm commitment in overall CSR. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence on the role of industry context in the level of commitment in corporate philanthropic activities. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines strategies used by the nonprofit sector in response to the 2008 economic crisis. Drawing on resource dependency and resource-based view theories as frameworks for analysis, we explore the impact the use of numerous strategies on nonprofit organizational performance during this time. We analyzed 280 surveys from the Nashville MSA where nonprofits reported on their strategic response to the economic crisis. Survey items were used to calculate human resource capacity, levels of resource dependency, firm performance, and a visibility index. Findings indicated that nonprofits that had fewer funding sources were more likely to have a lower level of strategic response. However, a website presence and visibility of a board of directors were significantly related to a nonprofit reporting that its resources stayed the same or increased. Experience in the market and firm size did not appear to be significant predictors of the strategic response level. Implications of the findings for how nonprofits can position themselves with the best strategic responses during an economic crisis and recommendations for future research are discussed.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper was first to find out whether the negative relationship between board size and future firm risk persists in China while contemplating all sorts of endogeneity. Second, the authors have investigated the role of large shareholders in influencing the managerial decisions concerning future firm risk via board size. Finally, the authors examined whether the moderating role of large shareholders is any different in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) in China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample included all the A-listed firms listed on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen stock exchanges over a sample period from 2008 to 2013. The authors used fixed effects regression and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size is negatively associated with future firm risk when measured as volatility in future stock prices and future cash flows. Second, large shareholders directly influence managerial decisions about future firm risk, irrespective of board size. Third, the moderating role of ownership concentration is insignificant in both SOEs and NSOEs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which has analyzed the role of large shareholders in the relationship between board size and future firm risk. This study provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of a developing country, into the role played by large shareholders in influencing managerial decisions concerning future firm risk.

In theory, nonprofit boards of directors exist to perform mission-setting and oversight functions that help to ensure organizational accountability. Yet there is evidence that board behavior often falls short of this ideal. Using survey data from a sample of 241 executive directors of nonprofit agencies, we investigated whether nonprofit boards are meeting executive directors' expectations, and if not, what factors explain this? We find that although board behavior tends to align closely with executive directors' preferences for involvement in administration and management tasks, there is a greater disconnect between board behavior and executive directors' preferences for involvement in mission-setting and oversight duties. Factors that mitigate this gap include organizational professionalization and stability, whereas more extensive reliance on government funding exacerbates it. Female executive directors experience a greater disconnect in their preferences for board involvement and actual board involvement than male executive directors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The paper aims to design and apply a Knowledge Management (KM) model within the context of a Higher Education (HE) institution in Mexico. The model is composed of six enablers: leadership, culture, structure, human resources, information technologies and measurement, which facilitate the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer and application. A 53-question survey applied to thirty-six (36) people allowed to evaluate the degree of development and implementation of knowledge enablers and processes. Objectivity, reliability and overall model fit were assessed. The application of the Model serves to highlight the core role that cultural, human and structural aspects play in Knowledge Management processes. Whereas Information Technologies are the least influential to Knowledge Management processes. This paper was limited to examine the perceptions of the Board of Directors of a single university. It is yet to be tested in other institutions. Moreover, the resulting model can be used as an assessment tool in Higher Education Institutions to identify the key elements during a KM initiative as well as to define actions to obtain the greatest benefits from these initiatives.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of human and structural capital on profitability of major airlines and examine whether region, capital ownership and control and strategic alliance play a clustering effect on profitability. Design/methodology/approach: Using information from the top 30 airlines worldwide, in particular human and structural capital proxies, a linear model is regressed. Test of hypotheses were performed towards the identification of the influence emerged from variables, such as region, capital ownership and control and strategic alliances, on intellectual capital drivers and profitability. Findings: Turnover is driven by human and structural capital factors, namely: employee expenses and benefits; size of board of directors; intangible assets; codeshare agreements; and passenger traffic. Airlines profitability does not depend on region, capital ownership and control or strategic alliance in which the company is integrated. Research limitations/implications: In spite of the limitations, we underline the range of time under analysis and the sample size. However, the current approach can be replicated over time and based in other rankings, structured on different metrics and approaches. Practical implications: The empirical results provide both an understanding of how independent variables positively affect the performance of airlines and offer some explanation as to the relationship between key characteristics of firms and profitability. Originality/value: The research adds value to the current literature by exploring the effects of new intellectual capital drivers on profitability of airlines firms. Focused on a sector that strongly contributes to improve the networking between nations, it provides a new and updated overview. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper assesses Andrew Pettigrew's contribution to management scholarship. This review addresses the process, content, and context of his research career. Chronologically, the process will be subdivided into three distinct phases: the period leading up to the establishment of the Centre for Corporate Strategy and Change, Pettigrew's time with the Centre, and Pettigrew's research since leaving the Centre. The content of Pettigrew's research focussed on big problems and emerging phenomena such as decision-making, organisational culture, organisation development, strategic change, human resource management, competitiveness, new public management, boards of directors, innovative forms of organising, high-performing research teams, and business schools. His contextualist methodology for process research will be explicated. Pettigrew's contribution will be contextualised by comparing it with contemporary research. The paper concludes that there is still a need not only to examine big problems and emerging phenomena but also to provide a processual understanding of management reality. There is a need to further develop process research methodologies such as Pettigrew's contextualism, especially with respect to process research methods.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate board director disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to check whether gender diversity, education, independence and size of the board of directors affect measures of corporate value creation. Findings: The empirical results show that corporate value creation is positively influenced by the cross effect of the board independence and the presence of women. They also point out a positive impact of the cross effect of board independence and management education. They reveal that the board of directors contributes significantly to corporate value creation, particularly when there is a mix of independent, female and management-qualified directors. Originality/value: The evidence presented and discussed in this paper should be of interest to managers and regulators. The methodological approach and the empirical results extend the existing literature. They enrich the limited empirical research devoted to this theme, especially in a continental European context, i.e. France. They shed light on the effect of board of directors' disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

This study analyzes the influence of composition of the Board of Directors and their social relations (board interlocking) on performance of Brazilian companies. A descriptive study based on documentary research was conducted with a total of 1,163 companies' observations and 18,119 standardized observations regarding directors. Simultaneous equations were applied to the data analysis. The survey results showed that, regarding the influence of composition of the Board of Directors on the performance of the companies, among variables used to identify its characteristics, that some showed endogeneity. Among the characteristics of the Board of Directors, the duality of the board was exogenous when comparing market performance (Tobin's Q) and the outsiders were also exogenous for internal performance (Return on Equity). Thus, the duality of the board is more influenced by the specificities of each company than by the market value of the companies. The characteristic outsiders are more influenced by the institutional environment than by the ROE. The practice of board interlocking proved to be insignificant in relation to the market value, indicating natural selection. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that the board interlocking can increase the dependency of the management, compromising the role of monitoring. Also, it is not possible to state that better positioned and central companies in the corporate relationships network show better performance. (c) 2016, Australian Political Economy Movement.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of corporate governance in companies and to delineate their effect from the perspective of two variables: the financial performance of firms; and an examination of executive turnover. An analysis on theoretical grounds of these two variables is made with respect to non-financial companies specifically in the context of the country of Jordan. Also in the context of this study, a company represents a firm. A sample comprising 109 companies from the non-financial sector for the fiscal year 2011 was selected and analyzed. A cross sectional study tested all hypotheses of the study and used statistical software, SPSS 20, to analyze the data. The study has examined the structure of the board of directors and its effects on the financial performance (financial leverage) of the non-financial Jordanian companies. Evidence suggests that the corporate governance mechanisms such as increasing the board size has a positive effect on reducing the level of financial leverage, thus leading to enhanced levels of financial performance. On the other hand, board independence and the structure of non CEOduality have no effect on a company's financial performance. In addition, the findings revealed that executive turnover has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between some of the factors and that is the board size and financial leverage. Given the diversity of trends utilized to measure the financial performance of companies in the area of corporate governance and the associated performance relationship, empirical research has continued to undergo new financial performance indicators to prevent manipulation and to obtain a realistic picture of the financial performance of companies. Hence, this is the first study that internationally chooses financial leverage to represent the financial performance of companies in their relationship with corporate governance. Crucially, it is globally the first study to choose executive turnover as a moderating variable on such a relationship. Thus, choosing these two new variables uniquely contributes to the literature of both corporate governance and firm performance from the perspective of developed and developing countries. This is considered to extend and add new insights to prior research in this discipline. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to policy-makers, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties in the Middle East; specifically in Jordan.

This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and 'increased career risks' perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country's culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate whether the revised Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2007 enhances earnings conservatism. In addition, the authors examine the relationship between board of directors' expertise and conservatism. The third objective is to investigate the relationship between audit committee characteristics and earnings conservatism. Design/methodology/approach - The sample of this study is based on 3,183 firm-year observations for a period of 2004-2009. The authors hand collected the corporate governance variables, whereas the remaining data were extracted from Compustat Global. The authors used two measures of conservatism. The first is the market-based model by Basu's (1997), and the second measure is the accrual-based measure by Ball and Shivakumar (2005). Findings - The authors find that the revision of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2007 results in improving earnings conservatism. The authors find two audit committee characteristics, namely, audit committee financial expertise and independence increase earnings conservatism, after 2007. However, the authors could not find support whether board financial expertise mix affect conservatism. Research limitations/implications - This study did not consider other possible corporate governance variables that could influence earnings conservatism, as it would be a difficult task to gather them. Originality/value - The authors provide evidence on the role of corporate governance and earnings conservatism in Malaysia. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

The reality is that most nonprofit leaders and researchers, lacking the simple criterion of bottom-line profit or loss, struggle with the concept of nonprofit organization (NPO) effectiveness and how to make it meaningful in their own organizations. This chapter synthesizes into key themes the results of recent research on nonprofit organizational effectiveness and explores the implications of these for practice and further study. Organizational effectiveness has long been a challenging and contested concept in the world of organizational theory and research. The idea that the use of certain board and management practices leads to improved organizational effectiveness is currently in favor. The additional perspective one find useful, social constructionism, is not a specific model of organizational effectiveness but rather a general ontological perspective. The author recognizes that nonprofit organizations have multiple constituencies, such as clients, employees, funders, licensing and accrediting bodies, boards of directors, and vendors.

As the civil society and corporatism theories have been frequently challenged recently, alternative theories emerged to investigate the government-ngo relationship in China. Some new theories are largely related to resource dependence or share core ideas with it. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the resource dependence theory. It identifies four groups of variables (organizational characteristics, board of directors, attitude and value, and external environment), finds support for their relevance from both Western and China scholarship, and applies them to the Chinese context. The resource dependence theory has the potential of empirically examining the relationship without over-focusing on the state or society. It is capable of explaining the dynamic and diverse relationships between the government and various ngos in China. (c) 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

This paper investigates the link between the board composition and the corporate diversification decisions of 50 large UK listed corporations over the period from 2005 to 2015. The panel data analysis integrates changes in board composition and its dynamic effect on the extent of diversification. We find that increased board independence influences the extent of both unrelated and related diversification. Neither institutional representatives nor extra-industry interlocking directors influence the extent of diversification in ways which promote shareholders' interests. The findings support corporate governance policy promoting board independence. In contrast, these findings suggest extending the involvement of institutional investors to board representation may not mitigate agency problems in large companies.

We estimate a hazard model of the probability of top corporate executives exiting their firms over the period 1996-2010. Our main findings are that: (1) female executives have greater likelihoods of exit than males, (2) the likelihood of exit increases with the independence of the board and decreases with the fraction of the board that is female and the average age of board members, and (3) a higher percentage of independent directors on the board lowers the probability of exit more for females than for males. Further, controlling for exit risk reduces the well-documented compensation differential between men and women. (c) 2016 The Eastern Finance Association

In 2001, as a young university graduate, Dennis Gentilin became a member of a FX trading desk at one of Australia's largest banks, the National Australia Bank. In the years that followed the desk became involved in a trading scandal that resulted in the resignation of the chairman and CEO, the upheaval of the board of directors, significant financial loss, and incalculable reputational damage. It was in this environment that the true meaning of business ethics was revealed to Gentilin. In this ground breaking book, Gentilin draws on both his personal experience and the emerging literature in the various disciplines of psychology to provide a very unique insight into the origins of ethical failures. The intellectual depth Gentilin provides coupled with his real life reflections make this book a must read for senior leaders, regulators, consultants, students and practitioners. Amongst other things, the book highlights the shortcomings associated with the traditional approaches used to explain and address ethical failures and illustrates how easily we can all, individuals and organisations alike, be complicit to unethical conduct. More importantly, it provides lessons and guidance to all leaders who aspire to build institutions that are more resilient to ethical failure. (c) 2016 Dennis Gentilin.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

In the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997/1998, the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) issued the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2000 (MCCG 2000). It was subsequently revised in 2007 following the Enron and Transmile debacles. In 2012, the SC issued the latest MCCG 2012 which introduced several new recommendations that are in line with developments in other parts of the world. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the structure of the board and its activities on firm performance post MCCG 2007. The study also aims to shed light on the effectiveness of the board of directors since the issuance of MCCG 2000 and of MCCG 2007. It also aims to reveal the preparedness of listed firms in Malaysia to embrace MCCG 2012. Using a population of non-finance listed firms for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 financial years, it was found that board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, directors' busyness, nomination committee independence, the establishment of a risk management committee (RMC) and board meetings are not associated with firm performance, i.e. Tobin's q. However, the market appears to be in favour of a larger board size. As for return on assets (ROA), it is not associated with board independence, board size, directors' busyness and nomination committee independence. On the other hand CEO duality and the establishment of a RMC improve ROA, while board meetings are detrimental to ROA. It can therefore be concluded that board independence is not associated with either Tobin's q or ROA. Hence, any corporate governance reforms should not over-emphasize the representation of independent directors on the board, rather the focus might be shifted to board activities, such as board meetings and the establishment of a RMC. With regard to board size, since the market is in favour of a larger board size, firms should increase the board's size to enable the appointment of women directors to the board. Finally, combining the CEO and board chairman roles should not be disallowed as the market views this favourably. Hence, the 'one-hat approach' does not appear to be applicable in the case of CEO duality. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This article aimed to investigate whether corporate governance uses tax management to increase companies' performance. The objective was checking whether corporate governance characteristics, such as remuneration paid to the executive board, segregation between Chairman and CEO, and the independence and composition of the Board of Directors, influence tax management in Brazilian companies. At the same time, it aimed to identify whether the preceding tax management is reflected on the subsequent tax management. To do this, a sample of 355 Brazilian companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA between 2008 and 2014 was used, in order to find out whether their corporate governance characteristics influenced tax management, something identified by calculating ETR, CashETR, and BTD. As a result, it was found (i) that the remuneration paid to executives may be regarded as a characteristic influencing tax management in Brazilian firms, and (ii) that the preceding tax management influences the future tax management. In addition, it was found that Brazilian companies do not rule out tax management benefits, since the average effective rate in the sample under analysis was 25%, and it is statistically lower than the nominal rate of taxes on earnings in Brazil, which is 34%.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the non-financial causes of organizational success or failure, provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes exploratory case studies in investigating the relationship of non-financial factors to organizational success or failure across a sample of sector-specific Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. A two-tailed study was designed, in which seven cases from both extremes were chosen from three Australian business sectors: finance, property and manufacturing. Findings - Non-financial factors associated with the organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included management skill, experience and involvement in organizational strategy, feedback and resultant activity, together with board of director composition. The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes could be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure. Research limitations/implications - The use of this method is very time-consuming but is highly valuable in case study research, providing a more in-depth understanding of how non-financial factors impact organizational success or failure. Practical implications - The research will provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. The improvement in prediction of organizational failure will reduce the costs of failure to all areas affected, from the large corporation to the small business. The inter-connectivity of all businesses to each other often results in a knock-on effect of failure with the cost being borne by all members of the community in some manner. The level of social impact and cost of failure can only be seen by the enormous costs of the Global Financial Crisis failures. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on effective qualitative research and explores important areas of consideration for those conducting qualitative multiple-case studies. It is intended to be of use to researchers investigating the area of predictors of organizational failure or success. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of what makes boards effective. We analyse the relationships between board demography and company performance and between working structures and board tasks in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We test our hypotheses on a sample of 307 Spanish SMEs. The main empirical result is the negative impact that the proportion of outside directors and the board size have on firm performance. We also find a negative impact of outsiders' presence and a positive impact of director tenure on the board's service role. Our analysis of the role of board control highlights the negative relationship between this variable and CEO tenure.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

This article aims at assessing the influence of women in the board of directors (BOD) on risk management in Vietnamese firms. The study touches upon a sample of 284 companies listed on the HOSE (Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange - Vietnam) in the period of 2008-2014. Their data was regressed by the random effects model (REM) and the fixed effects model (FEM). To find out which method is the most appropriate, we used the Hausman test. The study clarifies women's role in society and the optimal ratio of women in the BOD to minimise risks at enterprises. The authors give recommendations to corporate managers regarding proper employment policies, in which the role of women is better recognised. The most valuable result of the presented research is a grounded finding of an optimal female ratio in the BOD recommended for the Vietnamese enterprises. In order to achieve a positive impact of women on the risks reduction at the enterprise, the suggested female ratio in the BOD should be 34.96%, which will help to keep the lowest risk exposure. Hence, it could be recommended to raise a number of women in the BODs to approximately 1/3 of the total amount of members. Business owners may take this into account when planning human resource policies to maximise business performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Society Transformation.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

In modern economies, the corporate governance principles have been understood as drivers that mitigate the risk derived from the existing gap between managerial practices and ownership structure. This research contributes to the literature review, analyzing the relationship between the board characteristics, audit firms, and a set of indicators taken as proxies of performance. Based on a dataset of 124 non-financial companies, a linear model was regressed. We found that some characteristics of board of directors significantly influence the companies' performance. These new insights can also provide new guidelines for policy makers towards the establishment of new common rules and principles that accurately grant the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms and ensure the desired international comparability.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Well performed companies have always been linked with effective governance which is generally reflected through effective board of directors. However many issues concerning the attributes for effective board of directors remained unresolved. Nowadays diversity has been perceived as able to influence the corporate performance due to the likelihood of meeting variety of needs and demands from diverse customers and clients. The study therefore aims to provide a fundamental understanding on governance among high performing companies in Malaysia. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we examine the effect of the presence of the banks in the Board of Directors on the firms' debt ratio. Our results on a sample of 14 Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis stock market showed that the relationship between these two variables depends on the nature of administrators (lending and non-lending bankers, investors, and external bankers) and the probability of firms' failure (Z-Score). Our results show that the presence of lenders in the board of directors has a negative impact (the control hypothesis) whereas the presence of non-lenders has a positive effect on the debt ratio (hypothesis of expertise suppliers). Moreover, it was found that there is a negative relationship between the presence of investors, of external directors and of debt. The same results were found when integrating the variable of failure measured by the Z-Score in the linear model. (c) Nourchene Hamza Hakim, 2016.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Prior research finds that firms hire directors for their acquisition experience, regardless of acquisition quality (whether their prior acquisitions earned positive or negative announcement returns). Using several short- and long-run measures, we examine the effects of directors' acquisition experience on the acquisition performance of firms hiring them. We find that board acquisition experience is positively related to subsequent acquisition performance, demonstrating that firms appropriately value experience. Beyond experience itself, however, the quality of directors' prior acquisitions is also important. Our results suggest that firms may be better served to select directors based upon both past acquisition experience and acquisition performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Research summary: Does the degree to which founders keep control of their startups affect company value? I argue that founders face a "control dilemma" in which a startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between the startup's value and the founder's ability to retain control of decision making. I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0 percent. Managerial summary: A founder's vision and capabilities are key ingredients in the early success of a startup. During those early days, it is natural for the founder to have a powerful, central role. However, as the startup grows, founders who keep too much control of the startup and its most important decisions can harm the value of the startup. Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analyses of more than 6,000 private companies highlight that startups in which the founder has maintained control (by retaining a majority of the board of directors and/or by remaining as CEO) have significantly lower valuations than those where the founder has relinquished control. This is especially true when the startup is three years old or more. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Based on essence of the stakeholder and resource dependence theories, this study examines relationships between corporate board characteristics and sustainability reporting (SR) in oil, gas and mining companies in Kazakhstan. All data on board characteristics and SR were collected manually from annual reports, investment memorandums, sustainability reports, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, while financial data were extracted from financial statements of the companies. The results show that board characteristics such as board size and gender diversity are the most important factors in determining the scope and quality of sustainability information. The findings of the study will be useful for investors, policy makers, regulators and practitioners, as they suggest that effective board characteristics could improve corporate governance (CG) practices, which, in turn, could lead to more transparent and better corporate reporting practices in emerging economies generally and the 15 former USSR countries specifically.

The concept of greed is one of the oldest social constructs; however, greed as a managerial attribute that affects firm outcomes has yet to attract scholarly attention in management. In this study, we examine the relationship of CEO greed to shareholder wealth. After anchoring greed to familiar constructs in organizational literature, we test our hypotheses on a sample of over 300 publicly traded firms from multiple industries. As predicted, greed has a negative relationship with shareholder return, but this relationship is moderated by the presence of a powerful, independent board, managerial discretion, and CEO tenure. The contributions of this study, which include refining our understanding of self-interest and opportunism, developing the greed construct, and illustrating its impact on shareholder wealth, are intended to open a new line of inquiry in the management literature.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the association between board demographics and firm financial performance of Karachi Stock Exchange companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The connection between board structure and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the relationship between board structure and the performance of Pakistani public listed companies by using a sample of Karachi Stock Exchange 100 (KSE-100) indexed companies. This study exploits the corporate performance by accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q), and economic profit (economic value added). Findings: The outcome of the study shows the positive relationship between the board size, minority representation in board, and family director's in-board and firm performance. The authors also find that, instead of adding value, independent directors in Pakistan are negatively associated with firm value. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on KSE-100 indexed companies from 2009 to 2013; however, a large sample and multiple years' data are required. Practical implications: The paper provides empirical evidence that board independence is not necessary for public-listed companies in Pakistan and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance and firm performance by introducing a framework for identifying and analyzing moderating variables that affect the relationship between board structure and firm performance.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Previous studies have established that firms' effectiveness can differ based on the differences among directors within a board, and between boards. However, studies have yet to establish the effectiveness of the diverse attributes of the board on firms' quality of earnings in an emerging market setting such as Vietnam. This study investigates the effect of board diversity on earnings quality in a sample of Vietnamese listed firms. The two dimensions of board diversity measures in this study cover a wide range of structural and demographic attributes of board of directors, using a diversity-of-boards index (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) and a diversity-in-boards index (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members). Earnings quality is an aggregate measure compiled from four accounting-based measures of earnings quality: accruals quality, earnings persistence, earnings predictability and earnings smoothness. We find a significant, positive linear relationship between diversity of boards and earnings quality, while the relationship between diversity in boards and earnings quality is non-linear, with a U-shaped curve.

Expertise diversity is expected to enhance the monitoring and advising functions of boards of directors. Yet, little is known about the expertise that actually exists on corporate boards. In this study, we examine the diversity of professional expertise on corporate boards in Australia and implications for shareholder value. We categorise directors by 11 types of professional expertise and find the most common types of expertise are business executives, accountants, bankers, scientists, lawyers and engineers. We find that expertise diversity is primarily related to board size, industry and location. Our analysis also suggests that shareholders benefit when boards diversify their expertise within a subset of specialist business expertise (lawyers, accountants, consultants, bankers and outside CEOs). Further diversity beyond this subset of expertise is associated with lower firm value and performance. (c) 2015 AFAANZ

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

A wealth of governance research has examined CEO successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. Despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. In this article, we investigate whether disruptive CEO successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. We focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. We leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are--in practice--viewed as normative violations. We theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim CEOs and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. However, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise CEO departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board's decision to rely on an interim CEO. Our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded U.S. firms provides support for these arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

The present research study contributes to the extant literature on underpricing rather uniquely by addressing the under-researched linkage of corporate governance to underpricing. The originality of this effort also lies in being one of the initial efforts of exploring governance in context of initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in Indian settings. The study comprises an empirical analysis of 404 Indian IPOs studied for their board structures and ownership attributes using IPO prospectuses. Drawing support from the signalling theory, the variables board size and board committees exhibit a significant positive relationship to the IPO returns on the listing day. In Indian markets characterized by concentrated family-owned firms, promoter ownership does work as an effective signal for investors who take cues of firm potential from ownership patterns. Corporate governance measures have a miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing of Indian IPOs and indicating that investors do not incorporate these as a major consideration in their investment decision.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

This study applies a new multi-focal actor-centered institution-theoretic approach to examine the association between executive pay and the recruitment of social elites to the board of directors in developing countries. We use a sample of 119 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 17 African stock markets to model this relationship. The results suggest that a higher proportion of elites on the board is associated with lower executive pay. This is moderated by institutional quality; that is, lower institutional quality is associated with more directors drawn from social elites and with higher pay, while the opposite is true in higher-institutional-quality environments. Our findings confirm the importance of the social environment within which governance is embedded. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to ask the following question: is there a link between being politically connected, the quality of governance and the company's ownership structure? Design/methodology/approach: The author then examined Canadian companies from the S&P/TSX index for the year 2015. Findings: Political connectedness is significantly associated with lower quality of governance in relation to shareholders' rights; ownership concentration is associated with lower quality of governance in relation to the overall governance, board of directors, shareholders' rights and compensation structure indices; ownership structure does not mediate the relationship between political connections and quality of governance; and number of political connections through the executive is associated with less risky governance practices in relation to compensation structure; in other words, when members of the executive are politically connected, the firm adopts better compensation practices. Research limitations/implications: The time limitation is the main weakness of this study and probably the cause of observed mitigated results. Practical implications: The author hope that the results will inform regulators on the need not only to further regulate the business-politics relationship, but also to consider the specific traits of concentrated ownership companies and the most critical aspects of corporate governance in politically connected firms, such as shareholders' rights, particularly those of minority shareholders. For example, an intriguing case to investigate in the Canadian context would be Pierre Karl Peladeau's foray into Quebec politics and the controversy ignited by his political bid in light of his position as majority shareholder (75 percent) in communications giant Quebecor Inc. Social implications: In fact, the results shown that concentrated ownership firms have lower governance quality than non-concentrated ones. Furthermore, in a concentrated ownership context, the minority shareholders' rights could be threatened. In this sense, the results also shown that shareholders' rights seem to be the most critical governance issue for the politically connected Canadian firms. These results are therefore the indication that Canadian financial market regulators must take action about politically connected and concentrated ownership firms in order to further protect minority shareholders' rights. Originality/value: This study makes a double theoretical contribution by enriching the literature on corporate governance and by providing one of the first investigations into the direct and comprehensive relationships between political connections, governance and ownership structure.

This study examined the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation in service providing associations from the perspectives of agency, resource dependency, and resource-based theories. Results based on 349 respondent surveys showed that the the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation varied by the type of innovation (service, administrative, product, process, and capacity for innovation). Based on the results, practice implications are discussed, with a special focus on educating boards on the potential impact they might have on innovation through an effective performance of their tasks.

Research Question/Issue: This research investigates the antecedents of board members' monitoring behaviors at the individual level. The main idea is that individuals who are both conscientious and identified with shareholders are those most likely to adopt monitoring behaviors. Research Findings/Insights: The study was conducted using a survey of 166 board members of a large Canadian credit union corporation. Data on monitoring behaviors were collected directly from the chairpersons of the boards they participate in. The results validate the hypothesized moderated mediation model in which perceived importance of monitoring by board members mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and actual monitoring behaviors, on the one hand, and identification with shareholders moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and the perception of the importance of monitoring, on the other hand. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By investigating the mediating effect of the perceived importance of the monitoring role in the relationship between conscientiousness and monitoring behaviors, our study provides an empirical test of the attention-based view in the context of boards of directors and thus contributes to opening the 'black box' of board behaviors. Further, by looking at the interactive effect of conscientiousness and identification with shareholders, our study brings new insights into the motivational drivers of directors' monitoring behaviors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study invites practitioners in charge of board members' recruitment and selection to reconsider their practices in order to target individuals demonstrating high levels of conscientiousness. It also highlights the importance of implementing board cultures that value conscientiousness and emphasize shareholders' interests. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

We examine market reactions to the stock options backdating scandal in a slightly unusual way, but focusing on firms who were not perceived to have had a backdating concern, but were instead linked to firms who did have a backdating concern. These linkages can be found via board interlocks and the roles those directors perform. In addition we examine the linkages which occur from shared professional services firms, such as auditors and outside legal counsel. That these potential conduits are available is not in question, but rather, do investors perceive the conduits are used to pass along information about backdating stock options? We then ask if affiliation with dominant audit and legal services firms ameliorates or exacerbates those investor market reactions. We find that firms linked to the scandalized firms also face negative reactions, which are worsened when they also are serviced by professional services firms who are themselves are also linked to the managerial practice.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the extent of disclosure of provisions reported under IAS 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and explore the relation between provisions and corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: The current research utilizes a panel data analysis using a sample of 1,078 firm-year observations from Borsa Istanbul between the years 2005 and 2010. Findings: Overall findings indicate that 62 percent of 1,078 firm-year observations recognize provisions, and among those, only 32 percent provide IAS 37's full disclosure requirements. Firms that recognize provisions have larger board of directors and are more likely to be characterized with concentrated ownership and institutional owners. Also, firms with larger board of directors, greater independence and concentrated ownership have higher total provision/total debt ratios. Finally, firms that make full disclosure of provisions are more likely to have larger boards, higher ownership concentration and institutional owners and less likely to have CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: As with all research, there are several limitations of this study. The study suffers from a lack of literature about provisions under IAS 37. The lack of literature directly focusing on provisions or IAS 37 appears to be one of the main limitations as well as one of the main contributions. Since this study focuses on one country, the comparison is not possible. Further research may contribute to literature by the use of other emerging economy's capital market data. Moreover, further research can cover any other mandatory disclosure information specified in IASs/IFRSs and can provide comparative results about the compliance and strictness of the mandatory disclosure regime. Practical implications: This study can be of interest to government, investors, business management, regulatory bodies, educators, researchers, accountants, auditors and scholars particularly in the field of accounting by seeking to make theoretical and practical contributions in the area of accounting disclosures and also serves as benchmark for future researches on corporate disclosures. Also this study provides significant insights to accounting regulators who set disclosure requirements. Originality/value: Accurate corporate reporting is a necessary tool for the short- and long-term survival of the firms, hence the capital markets. Studying the level of disclosure will enable us to have additional insights about corporate reporting and will enhance the understanding of the nature of corporate reporting in developing countries. Disclosure practices by developing countries were empirically investigated in the past; however, the relation between provisions under IAS 37 and corporate governance has been unexplored in the literature. Thus, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a pioneering research on provisions and corporate governance structure. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the link between board of director composition and firm performance. Specifically, the paper argues that board political experience influences the firm's internationalization strategy as directors with significant political experience provide guidance, resources, and network access that enhance the firm's international presence. The authors also posit that board political connections would be more helpful for firms operating in high-regulation industries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the predictions using data from 156 large US firms. Data on directors' background were gathered from SEC proxy filings, while data pertaining to internationalization were obtained from Compustat and Mergent Online databases. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was employed to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The findings provide strong support for the positive relationship between board political experience and the degree of firm internationalization. Contrary to the authors' predictions, the level of industry regulation does not seem to significantly affect this relationship. Research limitations/implications: Firms aggressively pursuing international strategy could benefit from having directors on their board with robust political experience. One of the limitations of the study is that the types of international activities for firms is not specified in the study as it might be in the form of joint-venture capacity, strategic alliances or for firms that might be born-global. Originality/value: This study makes original contribution to the on-going research on board political activity and firm performance through internationalization strategy. The findings suggest that having directors' with political experience is an important asset in influencing firm's corporate strategy. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We exploit IFRS mandatory adoption as a source of variation in the demand for conditional conservatism to examine the role of unaffiliated bankers on the level of conditional conservatism. We show that firms with unaffiliated bankers on boards of directors experience a significant increase in the level of conditional conservatism compared with firms without unaffiliated bankers on boards. These findings hold after we account for other country-level factors that shape the demand for conditional conservatism. Additional analyses show that the role of unaffiliated bankers on conditional conservatism depends also on firm-specific incentives arising from the contracting environment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the role of corporate governance arrangements on financial reporting outcomes. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: Boards of directors are assumed to exercise three key accountability roles - control, monitoring and oversight roles. By researching one board type - investment fund boards - and the power relations around those boards, the purpose of this paper is to show that such boards are not capable of operating the three key roles assumed of them. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 25 in-depth interviews and a focus group session with investment fund directors applying a grounded theory methodology. Findings: Because of their unique position of power, the authors find that fund promoter organisations (that establish and attract investors to the funds) exercise control and monitoring roles. As a result, contrary to prior assumptions, oversight is the primary role of investment fund boards, rather than the control role or monitoring role associated with corporate boards. The findings can be extended to other board-of-director contexts in which boards (e.g. subsidiary boards, boards of state-owned entities) have legal responsibility but limited power because of power exercised by other parties such as large shareholders. Practical implications: Shareholders and regulators generally assume boards exercise control and monitoring roles. This can lead to an expectations gap on the part of shareholders and regulators who may not consider the practical realities in which boards operate. This expectations gap compromises the very objective of governance - investor protection. Originality/value: Based on interviews with investment fund directors, the authors challenge the control-role theory of investment fund boards of directors. Building on our findings, and following subsequent conceptual engagement with the literature, the authors differentiate control, monitoring and oversight roles, terms which are often used interchangeably in prior research. The authors distinguish between the three terms on the basis of the level of influence implied by each. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

A board of directors consists of a set of key personnel that hold vital positions in a company. Based on the premise of the resource dependence theory, we explore the association between board diversity and innovation performance in Malaysia. The sample consists of 220 companies from the industrial product sector of the main market of Bursa Malaysia for the financial year 2013. Board diversity is represented by a comprehensive score that includes age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, education, tenure, area of experience and directorship in other companies. Results of the regression analysis show that there is a positive association between board diversity and innovation performance. Our findings contribute to the policy involving the diversity of corporate boards by suggesting that policy, such as one of gender diversity in Malaysia, is expanded to include multi-dimensional aspects of board diversity that better represent the economic, legal and cultural environment of a country.

Research has confirmed private firm performance as a predictor of executive turnover, but whether this relationship holds in other organizational contexts--especially those operating without a profit-distribution requirement--is not known. For nonprofit organizations, performance monitoring and governance largely occur behind closed doors under the leadership of a volunteer board of directors. Nonprofits are commonly criticized as inefficient, even ineffective, and the accountability of boards and executives for organizational performance has not been sufficiently investigated. This article engages a unique dataset of 998 U.S.-based nonprofits serving missions related to the arts, health, and human services, and uses a multiple-spell discrete-time hazard model to evaluate nonprofit financial performance and the likelihood of executive turnover. The findings provide preliminary support that tenure in the executive office is sensitive to nonprofit financial performance, and in doing so, they raise new insights about the accountability of nonprofit executives.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that women who sit on boards of directors, as well as women that are part of an interlocking directorate, have on corporate performance. The investigation is placed within the literature on human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: A director data set for over 32,000 firms based in the USA, composed of 6,218 women and 54,932 men, is utilized. From this, regression and network analysis were utilized. Findings: It is found that female directors' participation in interlocking directorates translates into greater corporate performance when compared to simply examining female representation on boards of directors. Additionally, women involved in interlocks translated into greater corporate performance when compared to men. These results support the resource dependency approach. Practical/implications: Results of this study suggest that when considering female directors, corporate performance is enhanced when female directors already sit on the boards of other firms. Originality/value: This study highlights external network connections to differentiate between human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors.

We test two competing theories that explain a firm's engagement in corporate diversity and employee benefits: socially responsible investment theory and management overinvestment theory. We find that publicly-traded companies with strong shareholder rights are more likely to promote women and/or minorities to the positions of CEO and board of directors in their organizations, conduct business with women- and/or minority-owned operations, and provide better family benefits to their employees than firms with strong management power. These findings indicate that the companies with strong shareholder rights engage more actively in internal aspects of CSR activities, which supports the socially responsible investment theory rather than the management overinvestment theory. Shareholders (i.e. institutional investors) tend to integrate their social goals (i.e. internal CSR issues) and financial goals into their investments. In response to these changes, managers should engage in the internal aspects of corporate social issues more aggressively as the agents of shareholders.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to summarize studies aiming to define matters related to the quality of explanations found in corporate governance statements published by listed companies. Another important aspect of the conducted analysis is the identification of various dimensions of explanation quality. Methodology: The character of the conducted research is that of an overview of literature devoted to the subject. Apart from scientific articles, it covers European Union regulations, regulations characteristic of countries selected for the analysis (member states of the European Union), and applied solutions aimed at guaranteeing the desired quality of explanations for deviation included in corporate governance statements that are in the centre of attention. Findings: The conducted analysis organizes the current knowledge concerning actions aimed at improving the quality of explanations for deviation from principles of corporate governance. Without a doubt, the primary pillar consists of the level of information and its quality, as found in explanations for shareholders. It is this quality that determines if the shareholder understands the processes occurring in the realm of corporate governance in the company. Research limitations: The conducted analysis should be treated as an introduction to related research issues. It should be stressed that research into explanations provided by companies is still in the process of development, and the number of publications devoted to this topic is still modest. Practical implications: The study fits in the research into the phenomena of the "comply or explain" mechanism as applied in practice, which according of many researchers, continues to be poorly investigated. In terms of the directions for further research, there are promising topics including e.g. identification of factors that may translate into the quality of such statements (e.g. ownership structure, identity of shareholders), the role that should be played by institutions involved in developing CG codes (i.e. their successive versions), and the involvement of the board of directors/ supervisory board in the evaluation process. Originality: The present paper identifies the key factors perceived as determining the quality of corporate governance statements. In addition to that, it outlines new avenues for further investigation. (c) 2017. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs license

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

Purpose: The primary purpose of the article is to present the specificity of Russian boards of directors, critically analyze their main characteristics, and consider their relations to selected corporate governance mechanisms in Russia. Methodology: The article was prepared based on specialist literature, which pertains to the theoretical aspects of the boards of directors' activity and the changes in the corporate governance system in Russia. The qualitative research on the boards of directors' key characteristics in the Russian public companies was based on SPARK data. Findings: The central features of the boards of directors in the Russian companies depend on the key events in the Russian economy - such as financial and economic crises - changes in the companies' ownership structure, including the participation of the state in ownership, as well as on their activity on the Russian and international financial market. Research limitations: Research limitations resulted mainly from the lack of access to all the data about the directors of the companies under examination, including their independence from or obligation to the state institutions. Originality: The research on the Russian joint-stock companies - that is, corporate governance in Russia with its mechanisms - is a relatively new issue in the Polish specialist literature. They may be an important trigger for comparative studies in the field of corporate governance in Central and Eastern European economies. (c) 2017 Author.

The rise of MNCs, the expansion of the EU and several M&As have exposed German boards to a variety of cultures. But does diversity in the boardrooms improve performance? Based on an empirical study on German publicly listed companies, this unique research into cultural diversity answers the question if the level of cultural variety and cultural distance on boards of directors have an influence on firm performance in Germany. The results, which show a negative, linear influence of both cultural variety and cultural distance on operating performance measures, show empirical support for the importance of contextual factors in the relationship between diversity and performance. The authors ask for careful consideration before implementing regulations on board diversity. (c) Udo Braendle, Markus Stiglbauer, 2017.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how gender diversity in top management - i.e. boardroom and top management positions - affects business performance among Colombian public businesses. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the upper echelon theory which emphasizes that gender in an important characteristic that influences top management's decision-making, panel data models are used on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses relating to gender diversity and subsequent business performance. Findings: The results support that gender diversity is positively associated with subsequent business performance. More concretely, the relationship between gender diversity at the top of the corporate hierarchy - in the present case, as CEO and in the top management team - and subsequent performance becomes more evident when performance is linked to business operations (ROA), whereas the positive effect of women's representation in the boardroom and subsequent performance is significant when performance is measured via shareholder-oriented metrics (ROE). Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the role of gender diversity on performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how gender diversity affects performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in the top management, and where the appointment of women directors or managers is not driven by regulatory pressures.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Debates around sound corporate governance propose board diversity as a key attribute to sufficiently challenge executive management for stakeholder engagement. This study contributes to this debate by empirically investigating the effect of board diversity on corporate social disclosure (CSD) of Vietnamese listed firms. The study finds a significantly positive effect of diversity-in-boards (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members) on CSD while diversity-of-boards (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) has no effect on CSD. The results contribute by showing that a single theoretical approach can provide an adequate explanation for board diversity. The study contributes methodologically by demonstrating the design and measurement of board diversity indices, and a three-dimensional stakeholder-relevant CSD index. The findings benefit regulators and corporate executives in better understanding firms' CSD practices and stakeholders' expectations. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Firms' boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

Various regulatory governance initiatives have strived for board diversity, as diversity stimulates creativity, encourages discussion, and enlarges the board's knowledge base. However, increased diversity results in superior decision-making only when the board is free from conflicts and acts as a cohesive group. In this paper, we extend existing corporate governance research by introducing faultline theory to the board of directors (Lau and Murnighan 1998). The idea is to show how a board's diversity structure can give rise to the formation of subgroups along faultlines. The resulting subgroup formation may, in turn, reduce board effectiveness. Using a sample of U.S.- listed firms between 2008 and 2012, results suggest that boards with strong faultlines are associated with lower firm performance, lower CEO turnover-performance sensitivity, and higher abnormal CEO compensation.

We draw on a phenomenological model of institutional theory to explore how sub-national policies shape corporate board gender diversity of publicly traded firms. Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms in 49 U.S. states from 2003 to 2014, we find that firms headquartered in states with progressive policies that protect women from discrimination and provide greater availability of emergency contraception and public funding for abortions have greater shares of women directors in their board of directors. Our findings hold after a series of robustness checks and offer implications for theory, policy, and practice. (c) 2018

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Using the Heckman two-stage method, this study empirically investigates whether board directors' work experience in government and multinational corporations (MNCs), as well as the proportion of outside directors affects export propensity and export performance based on a sample of Korean firms. We find that the Korean firms with former government officials on the board are more likely to engage in exporting, although there is no empirical evidence supporting export performance. The findings also show that firms with former MNC employees on the board demonstrate higher levels of export propensity and export performance. Similarly, firms with a higher proportion of outside directors exhibit a higher level of export propensity and export performance. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors in Korean firms' first stage of internationalization and provide new insights into which type of board members can benefit their firms in terms of export propensity and export performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the diverse literature on board demographic diversity and to provide avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive literature review of theoretical and empirical studies published in leading management journals from 1989 to 2015. Findings: The literature review revealed several aspects that are related to board demographic diversity. These aspects have been classified into: definitions and types of board diversity, dimensions of board demographic diversity, measurement and outcomes of board diversity, reasons for existing conflicting empirical findings about the relationship between board diversity and firm dynamics, and research on mediators and moderators. Originality/value: Issues pertaining to board demographic diversity identified in this paper have theoretical and practical implications, and include avenues for future research.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This paper seeks to review the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between bank governance and performance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the existing research and offering guidance for investors and regulators on the major points of consensus and disagreement among researchers on this issue. Although the question of what determines the levels of firms' performance, with special emphasis on the role of the corporate governance, has long been the subject of substantial academic research, it gained increased attention in the banking industry in the last decade due to a series of financial scandals and, more recently, to the global financial crisis. In fact, in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, bank corporate governance mechanisms received heightened attention, accompanied by the renewed interest in the degree of effectiveness of such mechanisms, and their impact on performance. Given the vast number of influences on corporate performance, such as the numerous characteristics of the board of directors, there is an abundant literature on the determinants of performance. Thus, this paper tries to bring together this diverse body of knowledge into a coherent whole. Banks have unique attributes that interfere with the way in which the usual corporate governance mechanisms work. Thus, the main differences between banks and non-financial firms, which justify that some of the regularities found in the literature on the relationship between a set of corporate governance mechanisms and performance do not hold for banks, are also analysed. Then, we extensively review the literature on the board of directors and its impact on performance in the financial crisis and non-financial crisis periods. Finally, we also survey the (very) scarce research on the relationship between board characteristics and bank failures. (c) 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Purpose: There is an existing relationship among shareholders, boards of directors and management of companies. Corporate governance practices of companies are expected to ensure that this relationship maximises the wealth of shareholders. Differences exist among corporate governance of companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange. Companies, for purposes of liquidity, hold cash, but cash holdings also add to the cost of financing, according to working capital theories. The study, thus, sought to examine the relationship between corporate governance practices, ownership structure, cash holdings and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: The study deployed the seemingly unrelated regression to reduce the problem of multicollinearity resulting from the strong relationship between cash reserves and some control variables. Findings: The study found no significant relationship between board size and firm value. Similar findings were also made on the relationship between proportion of non-executive directors on the board and firm value. However, firms audited by the big four audit firms are valued higher by the capital market. Cash holdings of firms negatively affect performance, and this is statistically significant. A positive relationship arises between a firm's cash holdings and its value as a result of debt financing, even though this is not significant. Originality/value: The study is the first of its kind that deploys Tobin's Q as a measure of firms' value to reflect investors' valuation of firms in Ghana. The study is also the first of its kind to test the interactive effect of debt financing and cash holdings on firm value in Ghana. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

While prior board of director studies have considered the role of director occupational expertise in areas such as law and finance on the strategic actions of the firm, little consideration has been given to understanding the value that human resource expertise on boards of directors, or board HR expertise, can provide. Drawing upon agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates the relationship between board HR expertise and the extent to which firms engage in diversity management. Furthermore, the moderating role of two organizational context factors--capital intensity and firm age--are considered, as these can highlight the degree to which firms strategically depend upon human capital. With a sample of 423 U.S. firms listed on the S&P 500 from 2002 to 2006, the findings indicate that firms with board HR expertise have stronger diversity management in comparison to firms lacking board HR expertise. Moreover, the positive effects of board HR expertise on diversity management decreases when firms' capital intensity or age rises. This highlights the value that HR practitioners can provide in serving on boards of directors, and suggests that the magnitude of board HR experts' influence hinges upon the firm's level of strategic dependence on human capital.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While prior research demonstrates the strategic human resource (HR) advantages associated with offering work-family benefits (WFBs), firms continue to be reluctant in providing their employees with these benefits. Drawing on the corporate governance and stakeholder orientation literatures, this study examines the role of board independence and capital for WFBs being offered in publicly-traded firms. Our results demonstrate that various director independence and capital attributes are related to the firm offering WFBs. Specifically, board directors who are outsiders, women, and holders of additional directorships, with their broad stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of WFBs being offered by the firm [Correction added on December 14, 2017, after first online publication: the preceding sentence has been updated to clarify the findings of the study.]. These findings are of importance to HR practitioners considering the influence that corporate boards can have on the firm's use of HR practices, such as WFBs, that affect all employees, not just the executives.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There is a significant debate on the real contribution of board diversity in corporate strategies. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of board diversity on the disclosure process within a firm by focusing on risk reporting. The disclosure of this kind of information has become crucial in recent years in capital markets. Results show that gender and ethnic diversity in the boards positively influence the disclosure of information on risks. These findings contribute towards the debate about why diversity matters. Our study has important implications for the director-selection process since our results highlight the importance of considering the diverse background of board members. Regulators can also benefit from this evidence in order to issue recommendations and/or rules on the composition of boards of directors, as mechanisms to improve the disclosure practices of companies.

This article addresses the issue of sustainability of Italian opera houses by focusing on the relationship between board composition and organizational performance. Integrating agency and resource dependence theory, the authors develop a taxonomy of board profiles for opera houses and test the impact of both individual profiles and board diversity on the performance of Italian Lyric Symphonic Foundations (LSFs). They posit that different profiles will affect theatres' revenue structure differently, as each profile drives specific types of revenue, such as earned income, private funds and public funds. In order to empirically test their hypotheses, they perform a panel data analysis with fixed-effects and bootstrap resampling (N = 5,000) and robust clustered errors around theatres over an 11-year period (2001-12). While the literature stresses the crucial role of all board members in orienting an organization's performance, these new findings show the importance of different board profiles in affecting LSF revenue structure. The authors conclude that the board of directors can and should be mobilized to ensure the organization's growth. (c) 2018 Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), Montreal.

Purpose: This paper aims to assess the often repeated, but empirically unconfirmed, supposition that there is a positive connection between foreign board members (FBMs) and firm innovativeness and to set a research agenda for future studies on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses are based on a large sample of firms within the European Union, utilizing patent and trademark data together with information on the national diversity of the boards. Findings: The analyses confirm that there is a positive association between FBMs and firm innovativeness. Contrary to expectations, FBMs from less innovative countries than the countries of their host companies are more associated with innovative firms than are FBMs from more innovative countries. Research limitations/implications: This study provides empirical support for propositions, drawn from resource dependency theory and group effectiveness/diversity theories, that diverse boards of directors can lead to greater firm-level creativity and innovativeness. It also outlines a detailed research agenda for future studies to build on the tentative findings presented in this paper. Practical implications: The findings suggest that greater national diversity in the board of directors can enhance innovation. Originality/value: Earlier studies on board diversity have not analyzed empirically the issue of national diversity. The originality of this paper lies in its attempt to address this gap in the corporate governance literature. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

I review the empirical research on the role of stakeholders in corporate governance with an emphasis in contributions from the accounting literature. In particular, I focus on the following stakeholders: employees, the general public, the media, related firms, the government, private regulators, gatekeepers, and foreigners. This list does not include capital providers (shareholders and debt-holders), as the governance role of these stakeholders has already been covered by prior surveys in the academic literature. The discussion is structured around each stakeholder's incentives to influence managerial behavior, the mechanisms through which stakeholders act on managerial actions, as well as any concerns about this influence. All the analyzed stakeholders appear capable of influencing managerial actions to some extent, but the efficacy of stakeholders' monitoring role is controversial. Empirical research uncovers several factors that undermine stakeholders' incentives to discipline corporate managers. And more critically, in some cases stakeholders' incentives appear to be misaligned not only with shareholders' interests but also with the public interest. Taken together, the reviewed evidence suggests that the monitoring role involves a wide range of actors beyond the board of directors and capital providers. The review also points out that there is still much to learn about stakeholder monitoring. (c) 2018 G. Ormazabal.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

International Business (IB) research has surveyed firms' internationalization by examining the geographical dispersion of their sales and assets. However, less attention has been devoted to an important facet of their internationalization: the globalization of boards of directors. Drawing on institutional theory, we study the determinants of board foreign diversity by focusing on firms' sub-national socio-cultural context. We theorize on factors such as: attitudes toward immigration and conservatism that may impact the legitimacy of certain governance practices and may exert an influence on firms' propensity to internationalize their boards. Using a sample of S&P1500 from 2004 to 2014, we find support for our theory after using several controls. By bringing to the fore the interplay between sub-national factors and the globalization of boards, our study offers several implications for IB research. More broadly, our research delves into factors related to firms' sub-national environment that are likely to challenge their internationalization. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines whether post- privatization internal governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion in determining auditor choice of newly privatized firms in the Middle East and North Africa region. We find that foreign ownership and board size are positively related to appointing a BigN auditor, while government ownership, board independence and CEO duality show a negative correlation. Moreover, we find that the effectiveness of the board of directors acts as a substitute to the effectiveness of ownership structure in choosing a BigN auditor. Our results suggest that better governance provide a better financial reporting quality of privatized firms. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates whether the presence of advisory directors and monitoring directors varies across firm life cycle stages. We follow a parsimonious life cycle proxy based on the predicted behaviour of operating, investing and financing cash flows across the different life cycle stages that result from firm performance and the allocation of resources. Using an Australian sample, this study shows that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have more advisory directors. With respect to the demand for monitoring directors, we find that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have fewer monitoring directors on the board. We contribute to the literature on boards of directors by documenting that firms choose an optimal board structure based on their economic characteristics. JEL Classification: D22, G38, M14.

Using data from China's listed privately owned enterprises (POEs) during the period from 2002 to 2014, we explore the effects of firm life cycle on board structure. We find that the board size of China's listed POEs declines over firm life cycle, and there is a trend of separation for board chair-CEO duality while board independence remains almost static. We further provide evidence that board size and independence are determined by the benefits of monitoring and advisory roles of the boards through all the stages of firms' life cycle with different drivers. The impact of CEO power on board chair-CEO duality is determined by the benefits and costs of separation of board chair, and CEOs are supported at all stages of firms' life cycle. This article sheds light on the dynamic board structure in an emerging economy where the external corporate governance is weaker than that of developed countries. Our findings suggest that the board structures of China's listed POEs are adjusted at various stages of firms' life cycle, and the adjustments are mostly based on the resources brought by the new board of directors.

Firm performance is a major concern for all organizations and involves a multitude of antecedents. Reducing environmental uncertainty and dependency through the use of strategic actions in the resource dependency theory (RDT) framework and enhancing work practices through high performance work systems (HPWS) lead to higher levels of firm performance. We reveal the interconnectivity between RDT and HPWS and develop propositions as to how components of HPWS positively moderate the relationship between firm performance and the environmental uncertainty-reducing strategic actions proposed by RDT such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, boards of directors, political action, and executive succession.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

The financial crisis of 2008 and the introduction of the Interlocking Ban in 2011 (for financial firms) deeply influenced the Italian corporate governance system. The aim of the present study is to investigate to what extent personal ties among the directors of Italian listed companies have changed after these two events. We describe the evolution and dimension of the phenomenon of interlocking directorship (ID) for all the Italian listed companies over the period 1998-2013 using different methodologies. Social network analysis discloses the existence of clusters of companies whose links remain dense after the crisis, while connections to the peripheral units of the system decrease, reducing the overall connectedness. Results reveal that, over the period, there is a reduction in the cumulation ratio which still remains high and mainly due to a high number of directorships for multiple directors. This reduction is more severe after 2008 when both the financial crisis and the Interlocking Ban occur. In disentangling the two effects we observe ID reduction during and after the crisis, also for non-financial firms, confirming the general tendency of a decline in national board interlocking networks.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question: Using agency and resource dependency insights this paper examines first which type of firm-level antecedents trigger the adoption of OECD-type governance principles by Vietnamese listed firms at IPO. Subsequently this paper investigates whether the adoption of these governance principles leads to higher firm values at IPO and whether stricter governance is related to transparency after IPO. Research Findings: With respect to the antecedents of OECD-type governance in Vietnam this study finds that firms with foreign shareholders and younger firms adopt these governance principles. The adoption of stricter governance principles, especially in terms of strict supervisory board independence, as well as the appointment of directors with multiple director seats are beneficial for firm value at IPO. Governance transparency after IPO is unrelated to a firm's governance characteristics but positively associated with increasing firm size. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results show that agency insights are applicable in a context of concentrated ownership, low investor protection and weak enforcement, since stricter board independence leads to higher firm value. In addition resource dependence theory explains the choice of directors and provides evidence that boards with better network potential lead to higher firm value in this relationship-based emerging market. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Vietnamese firms benefit from higher value at IPO when they adopt stricter internal governance mechanisms and appoint directors holding multiple board seats. However, to ensure compliance with governance and transparency principles, formal institutional changes related to stricter enforcement of the regulation are of utmost importance.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

Corporate Boards of Directors are governing bodies responsible for the overall activities of the corporation in dealing with its environment. These strategic decision-making groups have been studied for their impact and reflection of societal values from perspectives such as gender diversity, racial diversity, ethnic diversity, board independence. Yet, little research has been done on underlying attributes of diversity such as diversity of thought as it affects decision-making. This paper uses Social Network Analysis to investigate social ties between corporate boards using a rich data-set of 1430 largest publicly traded firms in the US. We develop a measure of diversity from 2Step centrality and relate it to firm performance through cluster analysis. The results show that diversity of thought can be indirectly studied and related to improved team decision-making. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

This paper attempts to extend the concept of 'bundle of governance mechanisms' and analyses the dynamics of various governance mechanisms in relation to each other. Further, this paper seeks to answer if it is justified to exercise a huge reliance on board monitoring alone while designing or analysing the governance structure of a firm. This paper uses the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) approach to analyse the various hierarchical relationships based on the relative driving power and dependence of various monitoring mechanisms. The findings suggest that a huge reliance on board monitoring is justified to an extent as it has the driving power to strengthen other governance mechanisms. However, the relationship between board monitoring and firm performance is moderated by other governance mechanisms like product market competition and ownership concentration. Thus, board monitoring alone should not be considered as a benchmark to assess the quality of the governance structure of a firm. (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study corporate governance restructuring strategies of companies to adapt to new market conditions following conversion into a for-profit structure. It focuses on the changes in the composition of the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The paper conducts a field experiment using stock exchanges, which have become more international over time, and many of which have been forced to demutualize and convert to for-profit structures to compete more efficiently. The paper does a fine-grained analysis of restructuring in the composition of the board using the ANOVA technique. The paper also examines the impact of this board composition restructuring on the reputation of the exchanges using a regression technique. Findings: The authors find that the stock exchanges restructured board composition and refocused them to create better value. Results suggest that the conversion of a company to a for-profit structure brings efficiencies when accompanied by changes in the governing bodies. The authors also find that converting to for-profit firms had a positive impact on the reputation of the exchanges. The positive impact was even greater when accompanied by changes in board composition. Research limitations/implications: A stronger focus on the corporate governance dimension to understand the successful demutualization of stock exchanges is needed. Originality/value: The authors analyze the corporate governance dimension during demutualization processes of an under examined sector. The financial performance of the stock exchanges the authors study significantly improved after their conversion to for-profit organizations and provide an example of successful corporate governance restructuring.

This study examines the determinants of advisory boards in Dutch family small- and medium-sized enterprises. Boards of advisors consist of committed people that recurrently provide advice to the family firm's decision-makers. Using resource-dependence theory, we hypothesize and find empirical support for the positive influence of highly dynamic environments on the presence of an advisory board. Contrary to our expectations, the presence of a board of directors positively influences the likelihood of having an advisory board, suggesting complementarity between these two governance mechanisms. We found no support for a generational effect on advisory board presence. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper analyzes the relationship between bank governance mechanisms and credit risk in the MENA region. Methodology: Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to analyze a sample of 38 commercial MENA banks for the period 2004-2015. Findings: We confirm that different combinations of governance mechanisms can yield similar levels of credit risk taking. A single board characteristic is not sufficient to explain the credit policy of MENA banks. The independence of the board appears to be a necessary condition for reducing credit risk. The high proportion of institutional directors is associated with higher credit risk taking. In addition, we find that CEO duality and the high proportion of foreign directors were substitutes for one another. Originality: This research presents an application analysis of fsQCA in the MENA region. We examine the role of optimal configurations of the boards of directors of MENA banks. Unlike techniques previously used to investigate bank governance, such as multiple regression analysis, the fsQCA approach reveals which governance practices are relevant, and which are redundant, for achieving effective control in credit risk management.

Social network analysis (SNA) is an emerging research field in finance. This chapter references SNA and knowledge of corporate governance, to deal with a similarly emerging topic in finance, board interlocking, and shall examine the validity of the small-world model in a relevant emerging market and the existence of associations between the firm's worth and its network of corporate relationships. This study references official data relating to more than 400 listed companies. The main results suggest that the network configuration of the relationships between board members and companies reflects the small-world model. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant relationship between the firm's worth and its network centrality, described according to an "inverted U" type curve, which suggests optimum values exist for social prominence in the corporate network.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

Establishing effective corporate governance is most important at the time of an initial public offering (IPO), because the IPO represents a significant step by a company toward moving to the public arena. This chapter focuses on three characteristics that help describe structure of the board of directors at the time of IPO: board size (i.e., the number of members on a board), board independence (i.e., the proportion of non-executive members on the board), and board leadership (i.e., the choice to overlap the roles of CEO and chairman of the board). The chapter presents empirical evidence from a sample of 969 companies that went public between 1995 and 2011 in France, Germany, and Italy that shows how these companies differ from their US and UK counterparts.

Environmental degradation, scarcity of resources, and societal issues have been reshaping the strategic agendas and governance mechanisms of many organizations. From a traditional perspective, the duty of the board of directors (BOD) has always been to the owners and investors of the firm. With the beginning of the 21st century, a social paradigm has emerged, reflecting broader directors' responsibilities in not only fulfilling shareholders' interests but also addressing stakeholders' needs. Both research and practice emphasize a metamorphosis of the board's task, which is not restricted to maximizing shareholder's value but also involves going out into the real world and tackling the emerging concerns regarding social and ecological practices. Following the premises of stakeholder theory, this study examines the association between the determinants of the board of directors and sustainable performance. Based on the Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) and Standard and Poor's Global Broad Market Indices (S&P Global BMI), with a matching sample of 478 multinational companies, the results reveal a significant and positive relationship between sustainability and the board's size, gender diversity, average age of directors and number of committees. From a cross-national perspective, the study confirms the existence of dissimilarities in the characteristics of the boards of directors of European (EU) and non-European (non-EU) firms vis-a-vis sustainable performance. The practical implications of the study can be useful for policymakers and governance systems in identifying the nature of the "green" board. In light of the managerial inference, the study delivers an explicit recommendation on the composition of the board of directors and stakeholder management to promote sustainability adoption.

Purpose: This study aims to analyze the efficiency of banks under board gender diversity and to examine the determinants of bank efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: Data for analysis were sourced from annual reports of 21 banks for the period from 2009 to 2017. A two-step framework was used: first, an examination of efficiency scores with and without board gender diversity computed using data envelopment analysis; and second, a regression of board gender diversity as a determinant of bank efficiency using panel estimation on an unbalanced panel data. Findings: The results reveal that gender diversity promotes bank efficiency up to a maximum of two female directors on a nine-member board of directors, suggesting a threshold effect on bank efficiency. Board size improves bank efficiency. Board independence is negatively related to bank efficiency. Also, powerful chief executive officers are detrimental for bank efficiency. Finally, the authors find that ownership structure, bank size, bank age and loan-to-deposit ratio are important factors affecting bank efficiency. Research limitations/implications: All bank-year observations with no female representation on the board were excluded. As such, this paper is limited to 21 banks. Future research should look at a larger data set and account for dynamic endogeneity. Practical implications: The paper contributes to bank governance structure, namely, gender composition of boards, and provides an insight for regulators and shareholders to estimate the role of men and women on boards. Originality/value: The novel feature of the efficiency model used is that it incorporates board gender diversity as an additional input variable, in line with the preposition of proponent of resource dependency theory.

We examine the resource provision role of the board of directors in ensuring substantive corporate sustainability practices. Specifically, we examine two channels of resource provision (i.e., the presence of non-executive directors with previous experience in environmental issues--EEDs--and network connections of EEDs) that can affect a firm's ethical and environmental behavior. Using greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from FTSE 350 firms, as a measure of environmental performance, we show that the presence of EEDs on the board is associated with lower GHG emissions. Further, firms with better-networked EEDs have better environmental performance. A possible mechanism is that firms with EEDs invest more in environmental technology. These results suggest that, in addition to the traditional role of shareholder value maximization, the board of directors also caters to the interests of wider stakeholders of the firm by facilitating substantive ethical practices.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

This study examines the impact of corporate tax avoidance on board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) reputation. Our regression results show that when firms engage in tax avoidance, both directors and CEOs, on average, are rewarded by improvements in their reputations as proxied by an increased number of outside board seats. In particular, both independent directors and non-CEO executive directors undergo positive changes in reputation. We also find that CEOs of tax-aggressive firms experience enhanced reputations by gaining extra board seats. Our main regression results hold based on additional analyses. Overall, this study provides important empirical evidence confirming an association between tax avoidance and the individual reputations of directors and CEOs. (c) 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

Purpose: Boards of directors of large companies all over the world frequently have a certain number of shared directors, which can be motivated by social structures that foster different types of links, including investments and vertical relationships. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects that board interlocking exerts on innovation, considering the different nature of shared directors that finally determines the type of links dominating the boards. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses were conducted using data collected from 69 Spanish listed innovative sector companies during the period 2010-2014, which provided an unbalanced panel of 325 data observations. Findings: The results suggested that the typology of interlocks determined their effects on innovation, which had a positive influence when independent and extra-industry directors held multiple directorships, whereas it was negative in the case of intra-industry and women interlocking directors. Practical implications: This study provided evidence for the diverse effects of interlocking directorates and contributed to the open debate on the best board composition for improving business innovation, considering the common feature of shared directorships. Originality/value: The value of this research was twofold. On the one hand, the study considered a wide typology of interlocking directorates, such as women, affiliated and independent directors, intra- and extra-industry directorships, as well as shared directors from the same country. On the other hand, the effects of these different interlocking directorate typologies were analysed on innovation by considering different innovation indicators. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use the dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effect of board networks, as a source of intellectual capital, on firm performance. The authors propose that the influence of board interlocks depends on their ability to contribute to strategic decision making. As a result, their effect is subject to the business context in which they occur and the different role of the interconnected directors involved. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use social network analysis to make board connections and to calculate centrality measures. The authors also identify busy boards to analyze whether their effect differs from centrality. The authors estimate the theoretical model using the Generalized Method of Moments in order to take advantage of the panel database. Findings: For a sample of Spanish firms from 1999 to 2015, the results show there is no direct significant effect of directors' networks on firm performance. However, the authors find a positive and significant influence of intra-industry board connections, particularly when they are established among outsiders. Research limitations/implications: The Spanish context of the study can limit the generalization of the papers' results. Practical implications: The results can be useful both for practitioners - since they can serve as a guide for companies to reformulate their boards in search of the optimal structure-, and when implementing good governance codes - establishing limits for director interlocking. Originality/value: This study helps to offer a better understanding of how directors' networks can add value to the firm depending on the kind of resources they provide (context) and the role of the director who is connected.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

The awareness of board of directors' role in enhancing firms' financial performance has increased noticeably over the last years. Previous studies, however, have covered a traditional set of characteristics (i.e. board independence, board size and board meetings), but few studies are conducted to explore the impact of a new set of characteristics (i.e. political connections, number of foreign members and busy directors) on banks' performance within the context of emerging markets. This study was motivated to combine the new set of characteristics with the traditional ones to gauge the impact of them on financial performance. Employing an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique on a sample of 14 Jordanian banks listed at the Amman Stock Exchange between 2013 and 2017 revealed that the only variable that has a significant positive impact on financial performance is board size. Busy directors have not obtained the sufficient knowledge and experience or at least they lacked the required time to enhance performance. Politically connected directors as well as foreign members were a stumbling block in the way to positively improve performance. Board meetings and independence were found to be insignificantly associated with return on assets. In a nutshell, the Jordanian regulators need to devote more efforts to revise the suggested characteristics related to boards of directors; since the current composition of boards has been presented as a weak monitoring tool to fulfil principals' goals through enhancing banks' performance.

Purpose -- This chapter aims to evaluate the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards of directors and its impact on firm financial performance. Design/Methodology/Approach -- This study utilized both a systematic review and a meta-analysis, using a sample of 40 published studies, which gleaned financial indicator and observation data from 28 different countries. Findings -- As indicated in previous studies, while positive, there was no significant correlation found between the number of women serving on the boards of directors and firm financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications -- The heterogeneity between the various studies analyzed may present difficulties in making general conclusions. The chapter could also be subject to publication bias, as the selection criteria included may indicate a need for further peer review. Future meta-analyses should include data associated with other financial indicators. Practical Implications -- This study shows how composition ratios of men/women serving on corporate boards should be addressed in terms of proving for a greater diversity of leadership perspectives. Originality/Value -- Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have analyzed country environments as moderators for the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards and firm financial performance. The present study evaluates possible differences between the impact of the number of women serving on the board of directors on a variety of financial indicators (ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q).

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Purpose: How do business groups manage their internal processes? The purpose of this paper is to explore how board interlocks between members serve as control and coordination mechanisms within business groups. The authors propose that centrality of groups' affiliates in the group network of interlocking directorates is shaped by agency and resource dependence forces. In particular, the authors examine the role of international board ties as a resource and information conduit. Design/methodology/approach: This study leverages proprietary information on firm-to-firm transaction ties among all 155 affiliates belonging to a large Italian business group. The authors use network analysis to develop multiple measures of the centrality of each group member, and link these to resource transactions, ownership patterns and geographic distributions. The authors test the hypotheses in a structural equation model using LISREL. Findings: The results demonstrate that both resource exchanges and the presence of cross-national relations increase an affiliate's central position in the group's network of board ties. In contrast, ownership ties between members were unrelated to affiliate centrality. Originality/value: Internal governance mechanisms of business groups are rarely studied. While groups are often portrayed as inefficient or value-destroying, the analysis of proprietary firm data suggests a very different scenario: inter-unit ties are much more supportive of a model of business groups as strategic portfolios, using internal ties to share information and resources.

Drawing on an institutional theoretical perspective, we investigate the impact of the origins of organizational legitimacy on systematic risk using a sample of 358 Brazilian companies between the years 2002 and 2007. We regard three origins of legitimacy--formal-regulatory (presence in premium listings), cultural-cognitive (board of directors), and normative legitimacy (reputation)--to empirically investigate how a company's size and adherence to premium lists moderate other sources of legitimacy. Our results indicate that only under apparently better quality corporate governance conditions--presence in premium listings--do corporate reputation and the board of directors reduce systematic risk. In addition, we show that the effect of reputation on risk is positively moderated by firm size. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2018 ASAC.

Purpose: Some scholars have claimed that CEOs make decisions, while boards of directors control these decisions by applying the concepts of decision management and decision control. These concepts were suggested more than 30 years ago and are still applied in corporate governance research. They are now challenged on the basis of scholarship on corporate governance and management. Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance addresses the authority and responsibility that boards of directors and executives have. Management theory addresses planning and control in corporations. Findings: The relationship between the owners (the boards of directors) and the top managers is hierarchical. This paper concludes that owners or boards of directors make decisions on main and strategic goals. Decisions cannot be controlled, but the implementation and outcomes of plans can. The latter is managers' responsibility. The terms "decision management" and "decision control" are undefined and do not describe what takes place in organizations. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not contain any new empirical data. Originality/value: Management theory offers clear definitions of decisions, decision-making and control. The concepts of decision management (initiation and implementation) and decision control (ratification and monitoring) neither properly describe who makes major and strategic decisions nor how and who controls the consequences of these decisions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the composition and role of a board of directors in a family-owned microfinance institution (FO-MFI) in Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a longitudinal analysis of the board practices based on boardroom observations for the period between 2012 and 2015. The study further collected and analyzed qualitative data from interviews with board members, management, and institution staff. Findings: The findings indicate that even though external board members were appointed as a result of their diverse expertise and skills, their personal relationships with shareholders, life-cycle stage of the institution, and the nature of the industry influenced their selection. It was also found that the board played more of the service role in strategy formulation, resource mobilization, and networking, and, through that, members were also able to exercise control of the firm. Research limitations/implications: Because this paper is based on a qualitative approach, it suffers from the challenge of generalization. However, numerous research issues have been raised that require further investigation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the governance literature by showing what really happens in a family-owned firm, as it is based on a unique data set drawn from the boardroom of the FO-MFI in a context of a developing economy. This context is unique, given that most private MFIs operating as family enterprises do not have a professional board of directors. The study shows how the board contributes to a strategic direction of the firm in which the management and ownership are not separated, and the first generation is running the firm.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

The study analyzes the small-world nature of the board interlock network for National Stock Exchange-listed firms in India. The small world is the notion that each firm can reach any other firm in the network through a small number of intermediate firms. We find that since the introduction of corporate governance regulations in India, the small worldliness of the network has increased, indicating the concentration of directorial positions in the hands of few elites in the country. The small-world nature of the network can be attributed to the presence of few linchpins in the network and the majority of the linchpins are business group firms in the country. The linchpin acts as a bridge between otherwise sparsely connected clusters in the network. The firms that act as linchpins have higher profitability on account of access to a larger pool of resources. (c) 2020, (c) 2020 The Author(s).

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

The entrepreneurial attitude of companies is key to compete in a globalized and dynamic economic environment. Thus, it is of special interest the analysis of the factors that promote or hinder the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of organizations. In the case of family businesses, the interaction between the family and the business can directly affect the OE, although this effect may vary depending on whether it occurs in the top management team or in the Board of Directors. In addition, the effect of family involvement in both organs may be affected by their respective sizes. Based on a sample of 91 family SMEs, this paper shows the negative effect on OE of a high proportion of family members in the Board and in the top management team, an effect that is reinforced when the number of decision-makers in each organ is greater. This study also finds that the involvement of different family generations in the top management team has a positive effect on EO, decreasing this influence in larger top management teams In addition to the theoretical implications of these findings, the practical implications for managers and owners of family SMEs that are immersed in a period of professionalization are especially interesting. Thus, this study can be helpful in designing the size and the composition of the top management team and the Board of Directors of this type of organization. (c) 2019, Cuadernos de Gestion.
La actitud emprendedora de las empresas es clave para competir en un entorno economico globalizado y dinamico. Por ello, resulta de especial interes el analisis de los factores que promueven o dificultan la orientacion emprendedora (OE) de las organizaciones. En el caso de las empresas familiares, la interaccion entre la familia y la empresa puede afectar directamente a la OE, si bien ese efecto puede variar dependiendo de si se produce en el equipo directivo o en el Consejo de Administracion. Ademas, el efecto de la implicacion familiar en ambos organos puede verse afectada por sus respectivos tamanos. Basandonos en una muestra de 91 pymes familiares, este trabajo demuestra el efecto negativo que sobre la OE tienen una alta proporcion de familiares en el Consejo y en el equipo directivo, efecto que se ve acentuado cuando el numero de decisores en cada organo es mayor. Por su parte, este estudio tambien constata que la involucracion de diferentes generaciones familiares en el equipo directivo tiene un efecto positivo sobre la OE, disminuyendo esta influencia en los equipos directivos mas grandes. Ademas de las implicaciones teoricas que de estos hallazgos se derivan, son especialmente interesantes las implicaciones practicas para los gestores y duenos de las pymes familiares que se encuentran inmersas en un periodo de profesionalizacion. Asi, este estudio puede ser de ayuda a la hora de disenar el tamano y la composicion del equipo directivo y del Consejo de Administracion de este tipo de organizaciones.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

This study aims to investigate both relationship and influence of gender diversity in the company's board of directors and financial ratios on company's performance. In Indonesia, the number of females as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) leading public companies is quite numerous. It allows researcher to compare the performance of companies with different gender diversity statistically. The study investigated 364 companies from 9 sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in the period of 2014-2017. Balanced panel data regression was used to analyse whether gender diversity on the board of directors and financial ratios affected the company's performance. The results of the estimation showed that Price to Book Value, Debt Equity Ratio, Current Ratio and Total Asset Turnover influenced the company's performance. Although the influence of gender diversity was not significant, the results of the difference test proved that there are differences on company's performance, led by either female CEOs or male CEOs. These positive results will support the development of gender diversity in Indonesia's business world. (c) 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance among state-owned enterprise (SOE) in Malaysia. In addition, we examine whether board size and government's role moderate the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance in SOE. Using panel data regression model on 118 firm-year observations of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia from 2011 to 2013, this study finds there is positive relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance. The result provides supports that directors' remuneration acts as incentive to board of directors to perform their monitoring task. The result also indicates that larger board size and government play an important role in enhancing firm performance of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia. Nevertheless, when we interact both variables with directors' remuneration, the result indicates that larger board size and political connected directors moderate the positive relationship between firm performance and directors' remuneration. Our result provides evidence that the interaction between directors' remuneration and board size as well as political connected directors explain firm performance among state owned enterprise in Malaysia.

Despite high female participation in the Thai labour market, female representation on Thai boards of directors is low. This study investigates the effect of female representation on boards of directors on the level of corporate governance in Thailand. The ordered logit regression is applied to a dataset of companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The main results show that an improvement in corporate governance is associated with a higher ratio of women appointed as board directors. Furthermore, female leadership in the form of chairpersons on executive and audit committees, two important subcommittees, strongly and positively affects corporate governance levels. Finally, the presence of women on a board has a similar effect on corporate governance as that of the presence of independent directors does. The findings offer an insightful introduction to policy makers for promoting female leadership roles on boards to enhance corporate governance. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The emerging markets undergo constant transformations and changes, and thus, a change of strategy can be critical for companies. However, the impact of R&D investment on firm performance and the role of the board of directors that makes decisions about a company's innovative activities remain inconclusive. This paper investigates the relationship between a board of directors' composition and structure in innovative companies and firm performance. Using the panel data of innovative Russian public companies that made R&D investments in 2011-2013, we found a positive relationship between the boards' independence and ROA as an indicator of firm performance. Moreover, it was shown that innovative companies that establish a strategy committee will on average have a higher ROA ratio than innovative companies without such a committee. Innovative firms in emerging markets might consider creating strategic committees and increasing board independence to enhance their performance and increase the number of successful R&D investments.

Extending the proposition that boards of directors influence firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), studies have investigated how board interlocks - network ties formed by directors -- may shape M&A processes and outcomes. While board interlocks and M&As are two streams of research, each underpinned by voluminous studies, their cross-fertilization has been relatively limited. In this chapter, the authors take stock of prior research investigating the relationship between board interlocks and M&As. Specifically, emphasizing the network features of board interlocks, the authors highlight a connection aspect and a structure aspect of board interlocks in appreciating their effects during pre-acquisition and post-acquisition phases. Based on this framework, the authors then lay out a research agenda that can further bridge board interlocks with M&As. Overall, this chapter endeavors to integrate and expand our knowledge on the acquisition implications of board interlocks. (c) 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper seeks to present a new dimension to the dimensions of IT governance; it proposes a model for the board interlocking and the IT governance. This conceptual model is based primarily on the Resource Dependence theory and tries to interpret the relationship between the board interlocking and the IT governance. This paper has theoretically reviewed the existing literature of the board interlocking; it has also added to the real gap in the literature of corporate governance which has not explained the importance of the board interlocking with IT governance. The researchers hope to provides a solid foundation for IT governance in order to supply companies with information about the IT environment surrounding it, the operating procedures, and the effective monitoring of the information systems, the challenges they face, the opportunities they may have, and to provide members of the board of directors with neutral opinion about these opportunities and challenges. The paper presents several contributions at both theoretical and practical levels; it paves the way for researchers to discuss the board interlocking with IT governance which contributes to the development of the theories governing the work of these concepts. It also draws the attention of the companies' administration to one of the most important practices in forming and structuring the board, i.e. the necessity of connecting the board of directors with managers who are qualified with practical experience in information systems.

Sukuk yields mimic those of conventional bonds due to having similar features. Sukuk are shariah-compliant securities that offer different structures to those of conventional bonds. Therefore, it is believed that the spreading of yields should also be different. The presence of key institutional investors/owners and certain Board of Directors (BOD) characteristics as highlighted by the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may influence the yield to maturity (YTM) of conventional bonds and sukuk. Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these two yield spreads instruments with corporate governance mechanisms. The data is obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, the Bondinfo Hub of the Malaysian Central Bank, the Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM), the Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014 for 256 and 405 tranches of long-term and medium-term issuances of conventional bonds and sukuk respectively. The most significant findings show that the presence of top-six and other institutional ownerships as corporate governance mechanism proxy insignificantly and significantly reduce yield spreads within the firm revealed by Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and random effects models in long-term and medium-term issuances.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

How can one find out what decisions to make or what to do to really influence the behavior of some social system? Expressing a problematic dynamic in the language of SFD is certainly a first step but not sufficient for any kind of change. When leaders at the G7 Summit (2015) decided that decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century is needed, saying it alone won't make it happen. When a board of director sets out a strategic direction, this does not by itself become reality. History is full of management decisions never manifest, whether they were strategies in companies or policies in governments. Wishes, intentions, or goals framed as managerial or political decisions do not change a social system's dynamics. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

This chapter explores a crisis Jeonju iCOOP confronted, which has been changed into a new opportunity afterward. A cooperative is a member-owned and democratically governed enterprise, which shows different governance properties to those of corporations. The present research investigates cooperative governance practice and how board members in cooperatives internalize the cooperative values and principles. Cooperative governance has been relatively less theorized compared to corporate governance, which is generating many studies applying various competing theories of governance in the profit sector. The Board of Directors of Jeonju iCOOP cognizes the situation where they might lose their office and the deposit for it as a crisis and tried to find a solution through active interaction. Each board member was initially a member of the cooperative who joined Jeonju iCOOP to fulfill their own needs. In the case of Jeonju iCOOP, the board members formalized the issues derived from the ecological change based on their own experiences and cognition.

The study aims to determine how different factors shape the size of boards of directors in private firms conducting an initial public offering (IPO) on the regulated Euronext Paris market. These factors include the presence of a venture capitalist, ownership structure, firm-specific characteristics and CEO characteristics. To study the determinants of board size, we used a sample of 568 firms that went public from 1995 to 2012 and found that the boards tend to become more independent shortly after going public, which indicates that firms are affected by monitoring in financial markets. The study found strong evidence that ownership variables, board structure variables, CEO characteristic variables and firm characteristic variables tend to affect board size. Our results also indicate that venture capitalists are a major catalyst for IPOs because they provide financing and strategic advice, act as an opposing force to the CEO and shape the governance structure.

The Business Roundtable, a large group of top CEOs, recently issued a statement defining the purpose of the corporation in stakeholder terms, a direct and intended reversal from an earlier statement that defined the duty of directors as serving the interests of stockholders. In this editorial, we briefly describe the major twists and turns in the stockholders-versus-stakeholders debate that make this statement so significant to management theory and practice. We then describe the implications of the statement for scholars and practicing managers. We end with a description of three specific research topics that require more research in light of this statement: firm boundaries, the nature of value creation systems, and theory regarding the destruction of stakeholder value.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the mediating role of board effectiveness (understood as the capacity to efficiently manage and control all functions to guarantee the company's prosperity) in the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use partial least squares methodology to test the direct and indirect relationships between gender diversity in boards of directors and business performance. Findings: Although the relationship between the presence of women on the board and the board's effectiveness is statistically significant, this relationship is negative. However, board effectiveness (measured by the three constructs: strategic control, organizational innovation and decision-making) has a positive and statistically significant effect on business performance. Finally, there is a positive, but not statistically significant, relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has a small sample size, and most of the boards of directors analyzed are unequal with only a few companies achieving gender parity. Social implications: Public institutions must promote actions to achieve a critical mass of women directors and managers, so that women transcend a merely "symbolic" role on a board and are able to develop their skills and characteristics, thereby improving a board's effectiveness and business performance. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the diversity and governance literature by providing a better understanding of the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. It considers the influence of women on the board through a holistic framework, analyzing the mediating role of the board's effectiveness. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' roles namely strategy, service and control roles and ambidextrous innovation. This study also aims to determine whether the independence and gender diversity of boards have mediating effects in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a quantitative approach, the authors conducted a survey on all Tunisian-listed firms. A partial least square method was used to analyze the quantitative data. The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of boards' members of the surveyed firms followed by a thematic analysis of the discourses to discuss the results. Findings: Results revealed that ambidextrous innovation is negatively linked to board's control role. The outcomes of this research show also that ambidextrous innovation is positively associated with board's service role and that the gender diversity moderates positively this link. Findings do not indicate a significant relationship between board's strategy role and ambidextrous innovation but show evidence that the relationship is negatively moderated by independent directors, while positively moderated by gender diversity. Originality/value: This research sheds light on the effects of Boards' roles on ambidextrous innovation and the moderating effect of board's gender diversity and independence as well. This paper addresses the gap in the literature as this thematic has not been studied, offering key insights with regard to corporate governance of companies looking to achieve ambidextrous innovation.

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

Business and politics are now more connected than ever. In Canada, more than 50% of listed companies have political connections through the board of directors or top management. These ties can give companies the resources they need to achieve their goals and possibly even confer a substantial advantage that results in better financial performance. To this end, political connections must influence the various choices and behaviours of politically connected companies, such as their voluntary disclosure strategy. As this type of influence has rarely been investigated in the literature, the current study looks at the impact of board and top management political connections on the voluntary disclosure behaviour of Canadian firms. Four types of voluntary disclosure--environmental, social, governance and total--are analyzed. Results show that politically connected companies make broader voluntary disclosures than non-connected firms do. Board and top management political connections are positively and significantly related to total voluntary disclosure, and board political connections are positively and significantly related to governance disclosures. In addition, top management political connections are positively and significantly related to voluntary environmental and social disclosures. This study is the first to shed light on the link between political connections and the voluntary disclosure of Canadian listed companies, as well as the first to confirm that not all political connections are equal. The impact of these connections on companies' choices and behaviours can differs according to the politically connected actor's position in the company, including on the board of directors or in top management. This difference could be explained by the fact that while board are generally concerned about strategic issues, top management deal with operational aspects. Consequently, they may not have the same behaviours and choices. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

The paper examines the influence of corporate governance (CG) and earning quality (EQ) on corporate value (FV) of Vietnamese enterprises. The study uses GLS regression and linear structure model using data collected from companies listing on the stock market in Vietnam during 2008-2018, with a total of 2,937 observations. The research results indicate that EQ and CG represented by the Integrated Board of Directors and the Integrated Supervisory Board have a positive effect on FV directly and indirectly. The results show that the Integrated Board of Directors has a positive effect on EQ, whereas the Integrated Supervisory Board has a negative effect on EQ. Based on the research results, we suggest that companies need to strictly comply and implement GC, so to bring down the agency cost and consequently to increase performance. The companies also should establish the Board of Director of a proper size, with financial and accounting specialty, and including women board members. The government also needs to improve the management mechanism asking for firms to prepare and publish financial statements with reliable company information, which could be provided to users. These recommendations are a useful basis to help businesses improve FV via changes in the corporate governance factors in each enterprise. (c) The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims at examining the level of risk of disclosure practices and the effect of four board of directors' characteristics (board size, board meetings, CEO duality and board expertise) on these practices in the Jordanian context. This study also adds to the body of literature by examining the moderating effect of family ownership on the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study contains the non-financial Jordanian firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). 376 annual reports of the sampled firms over four years from 2014 to 2017 were used. The content analysis approach was used to collect data and to determine the level of risk disclosure by computing the number of risk-related sentences in the annual reporting. To test the study's hypothesis, the random effect model was employed. Findings: The empirical results show that the total of the risk disclosure sentences for each firm ranges from a minimum value of 2 sentences to a maximum value of 61 sentences, and the mean of CRD is 28 sentences. The results also indicate that the board expertise is positively related with the level of risk disclosure. Conversely, CEO duality has a negative impact on the risk disclosure practices. However, the results failed to support that the board size and the board meetings have a significant effect on the level of risk disclosure. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the family ownership moderates the relationship between the board of directors and the corporate risk disclosure. Practical implications: The finding of this study is more likely be useful for many concerned parties, researchers, authorities, investors and financial analysts alike in understanding the current practices of the risk disclosure in Jordan, thus helping them in reconsidering and reviewing the accounting standards and improving the credibility and transparency of the financial reports in the Jordanian capital market. Originality/value: The current study contributes to the literature of risk disclosure because the previous research has paid little attention to this topic in Jordan. To the best knowledge of the researcher, this study is the first Jordanian study that focuses on examining the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure in the non-financial sector. Furthermore, it is the first study that examines the moderating role of family ownership on such relationships. Consequently, the results of the current study draw attention to the CRD practices and the monitoring role of board of directors in Jordan. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of gender diversity among the board of directors (BOD) and Shariah supervisory board (SSB) members on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for a sample of 19 Islamic banks for the period 2010-2018 were collected to test the research hypotheses using pooled ordinary least squares estimation method. Generalized least squares estimation method was used to confirm that the results are robust. This study lagged the explanatory variables by one period to control for potential endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that Islamic banks with more gender-diverse BOD and SSB are expected to have better financial performance. In addition, this paper finds that an increase in Islamic banks' size may undermine the positive impact of gender diversity among SSB members on Islamic banks' financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only on Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to data constraints; thus, the results may not be generalizable to Islamic banks in other countries. Practical implications: Improving financial performance is crucial for banks, especially for Islamic banks, to sustain their fast-growing share globally. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to provide insight and understanding in the selection and appointment of BOD and SSB members at Islamic banks. Social implications: By having women represented in the BOD and SSB, Islamic banks will benefit equally from valuable abilities across demographic groups in the society. Furthermore, if the members of the BOD and SSB are properly selected, Islamic banks with more gender-diverse boards can effectively contribute to enhancing social welfare of various segments in the society. Originality/value: This is the first study, as far as is known to the authors, that provides empirical evidence on the influence of gender diversity among BOD and SSB members on the financial performance of Islamic banks. This paper is expected to be used as a reference by the shareholders and customers of Islamic banks in ensuring that the BOD and SSB have the best optimal composition that maximizes their profits.

Drawing on resource dependence theory and group diversity research, this paper examines how board gender and racial diversity impact corporate divestitures. We argue that due to the diverse experiences, knowledge, and perspectives that female and racial minority directors bring to the boardroom, it is more difficult and time-consuming for the board to reach a consensus and pursue a common course of action. Consistent with this argument, our results indicate that board gender and racial diversity lead to longer divestiture completion times and a lower divestiture rate. Additionally, we argue that due to their cognitive heterogeneity, diverse boards likely exchange a greater variety of information, engage in more thorough discussions, and implement greater oversight of divestitures, leading to more positive divestitures returns. Offering mixed support for this argument, we found that while gender diversity increased divestiture returns, racial diversity was associated with lower divestiture returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

The aim of this paper is to bring together some of the foundational and recent literature interlinking corporate governance and the leadership role of the board of directors. Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the boardroom assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards' involvement in the strategic leadership processes.

Corporate social responsibility is an inevitable trend in the global context. It is the responsibility of the organizations to the community and society to ensure the fairness of the interests of stakeholders. This is an issue that deserves attention, not in the national or regional level, but as a global issue. The purpose of article is to examine the effect of corporate governance on corporate social responsibility disclosure of 155 samples of 31 Vietnamese commercial banks from 2015 to 2019. The data of this study is employing time-series data and used the ordinary least squares to test the model. The results show that there are three factors that positively affect corporate social responsibility disclosure, namely, board size, foreign members of board, and audit committee. Thereby, the article proposes that board of director in Vietnamese commercial banks needs to raise awareness about corporate social responsibility, and the Central bank of Vietnam should monitor the disclosure of information regularly with severe sanctions on commercial banks that do not comply with the regulations of corporate social responsibility disclosure. This contributes to improving the information quality of the banking sector to meet the trend of international economic integration.

This study aims at investigating the associations of board of directors' size, board of directors' meetings, firm size and firm leverage with firm performance among energy industry in Saudi Arabia for periods ranging from 2005 to 2018. The final sample in this study consists of 56 observations. The ordinary-least square regression shows that board size is associated positively with firm performance. Further, the results of this study repot that board meetings, firm size and firm leverage are associated negatively with firm performance in the context of Saudi Arabia. The results of this study are important for policy makers at the country and corporate levels on issues related to corporate performance. Further, the results of this study can be used in future research to gain a deeper understanding of the issues of corporate performance. (c) 2020, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of board quality, audit quality and audit report lag on firm performance of manufactured Saudi's listed companies. The framework of the study is developed based on the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory that board quality, audit quality and audit report lag are associated with the firm performance. This study used 180 observations for the periods ranging from 2015 to 2017. The board quality is measured by two independent variables; board size and board meetings, audit quality is measured by the auditor brand name, the audit report lag is measured by the year-end to the date of the auditor's report, and firm performance is measured by the ROA and ROE. Using the pooled OLS Regression, the results show that out of four hypothesized independent variables, only audit quality has a significant and positive association with firm performance and audit report lag has a negative and significant association with firm performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to board and audit in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the quality of their board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

This study examines the effect of Islamic banks' dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on technical efficiency; and whether the effect of such governance mechanisms varies between normal times and global financial crisis period. The results show that Shariah supervisory board contributes to reducing an Islamic bank's technical inefficiency. During the GFC, both SSB governance and regular board governance generate an incremental efficiency gain to Islamic banks, but the effect is more pronounced for SSB governance. The key findings on the governance-inefficiency relationship are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity of corporate governance. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A company's board of directors plays a critical role in making decisions relating to strategy, high-level structure, and the appointment of the CEO. The role of the board and its impact on corporate performance has been well studied; however, the diversity of the board of directors and the corresponding correlation to the level of corporate innovativeness has not been previously investigated. Here, we provide a critical analysis of board members' diversity as it relates to innovative corporations in what is considered a mature industry in transition to a bioeconomy: the pulp and paper industry. Our findings contribute to the body of knowledge on the role of board member diversity in shaping company culture and how that drives, shapes, and sustains innovation. (c) 2020, The Author(s).

The study examines the relationship between corporate attributes and ESG disclosure among selected companies in United Arab Emirates. The corporate attributes are company size, profitability, liquidity, industry sensitivity and leverage. The descriptive statistics reveals a maximum disclosure score of 78 and a minimum score of 32. The results of the regression analysis show that only company size, industry sensitivity and liquidity are significant determinants of ESG disclosure in UAE. Our findings show that firms with larger asset base and good degree of liquidity disclose more ESG information. However, firms in the service sector are more inclined to ESG disclosure than manufacturing firms. We recommend that the board of directors should make sustainability reporting a front burner in its corporate strategy. In addition, the regulatory authorities should legalise ESG disclosure among UAE firms. Finally, lenders of corporate funds should make certified ESG report as a major condition precedent to obtaining funds. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show that social relations in a corporate governance platform between members of supervisory boards and between members of supervisory and executive board tiers can serve as an alternative viewpoint for understanding mechanisms of social selection in corporate governance networks. The study shows that through the lenses of social network analysis, it is possible to identify and understand how the process of corporate governance member selection unfolds within companies and how that selection process may have been potentially influenced by the cross-board relations, such as interlocking directorships. Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well.

The board of directors play an important role in corporate climate strategy-making and decisions but might also compromise environmental policies to minimize agency cost. This study critically investigates the relationship between the attributes of the board of directors and the degree of sustainability performance for the energy sector as discussed in the literature. Our study cumulates existing knowledge offering important characteristics for a balanced board structure to increase the board's effectiveness in adopting sustainable initiatives that could reduce the adverse impact of an energy corporation's operation on the environment. Crucial attributes of the board of directors deemed to be positively associated with the commitment to reduce carbon footprint in the environment have been identified. Based on our extensive analysis of the literature we propose a conceptual framework that measures the influence of the board of directors' attributes on corporate environmental and social sustainability performance. The proposed framework will be useful as an initial step for top management and regulators to gain a better understanding of the balanced board structure required to achieve the social and environmental sustainability performance of corporations. Further, this paper contributes to a body of knowledge about how the board of directors could play a crucial role in monitoring social and environmental threats.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the differential impact on the stock market of statements made by and information about directors and companies who are politically connected, compared to directors and companies with no political connections. The authors also analyze the role played by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which the authors have identified as politically connected companies because most board members are appointed by political authorities. Furthermore, the boundaries and institutional environment within which SOEs operate are likely to be different from private companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is composed of over 60,000 news articles on the boards of directors (both with political roles and without political roles) of listed Italian companies in the period 1998-2013. On that sample the authors run a regression analysis under the signaling theory approach. Findings: Results suggest a positive effect on market capitalization associated with individual political connections. This effect decreases when the political connection extends to the whole enterprise although it still remains, while a negative effect is associated with state-controlled enterprises. The impact of negative news content does not change depending on whether a board member has a political role or not. Originality/value: Previous research has demonstrated a causal link between stock prices and their reaction to corporate news (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011; Peress, 2014), but no studies have quantified the different reactions that occur when the news mentions politically connected companies and individuals who hold a political role.

Gender diversity in boards of directors has the potential to add value to the organizations that promote it. Under the premise of theories such as: agency, resource dependence or stakeholders, there have been several studies that have analysed the relationship between the number of women in the boards and the economic and financial results of the companies. However, the review of these papers allows us to obtain two clear conclusions. First, that the results are not conclusive, since positive, negative and non-significant relationships have been found between both variables. And the second, that most of these studies have been carried out on large companies listed on the Stock Exchange Market, mainly Public Limited Companies and Limited Liability Companies. In this way, this paper tries to contribute to the literature on this topic, analysing the gender diversity in the board of the Spanish agri-food cooperative societies and their influence on the profitability of the company. Specifically, 1171 cooperatives of the agri-food sector in Spain have been analysed, using statistical regression techniques. The results show that there are significant differences depending on the type of board, classifying them according to the degree of parity of each one, and the ROE and ROA profitability measures. In addition, in the case of the ROA, a positive and significant relationship is also observed between the percentage of women on the board and this variable of profitability.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

In this study we examine the effect of boardroom social capital, defined as the aggregate benefits from the social networks of outside directors, on director compensation. Using a large panel of nine thousand firm-year observations for the period 2007-2013, we find that boardroom social capital is positively priced. Further analysis shows that firms pay a premium for networked directors. Firms that have suffered adverse events such as a bad merger, performance declines, or dividend cuts, pay a higher connection premium. We determine that well-connected directors perform important board roles and hold multiple directorships. Overall, our results are consistent with an efficient contracting explanation for boardroom pay. (c) 2019

This study investigates the effect of three categories of factors on the decision by financial companies to adopt the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These factors are linked to (i) resources available to the firm (ii) the search for legitimacy and (iii) governance. Univariate and multivariate analyses are applied on a sample of 198 financial firms between 2006 and 2015. The results show that financial companies that are more likely to become PRI signatories have fewer available slack resources, are more scrutinized by the public, are bigger and have a board of directors characterized by greater gender diversity and independence than nonsignatory companies.

Using an extensive and unique data set that has been created to record the composition of the boards of directors of the top 250 British firms between 1904 and 2010, this article builds upon a previous study by the authors on the corporate network to 1976 by extending the study to 2010. The analysis revolves around three key observations: the nature and depth of the corporate network; the distinct stages in corporate connectivity between 1976 and 2010; and the 1980s watershed in the relationship between financial and other sectors, following which financial institutions withdrew from the corporate network. The article concludes with an analysis of how the data set has changed our perceptions of British corporate networks, wider changes in British business, and a discussion of implications for future research.

We use data from Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the UK to examine the link between the presence of women directors and exporting activity. To do this, we build on resource-based view (RBV) and resource dependence theory (RDT) and show that SMEs with women on the board of directors are less likely to be involved in exporting activity compared to SMEs without women directors. Nevertheless, this negative relationship may be moderated by seeking network advice, which can be explained through the social network theory (SNT). (c) 2020, Oviedo University Press.

Purpose: It is commonly stated that increased board diversity leads to the heightened financial performance of firms via the impact that it can have on innovation, but the latter association has, thus far, remained empirically controversial. The aim of this paper is to shed light on this unresolved debate and gap in the literature via studying different types of diversity. Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analysis was conducted on the existing empirical evidence on the topic to show whether such an association exists and compare cognitive (expertise and experience) and demographic diversity (gender, nationality and racial/ethnic). Findings: The results show that there is indeed a positive and statistically significant association between board diversity and firm innovation. This association is driven more by cognitive diversity of the board members than by demographic diversity. Research limitations/implications: Potential publication bias, heterogeneity in the quality of the existing studies and the diversity in operationalising innovation and board diversity remain as limitations to this meta-analysis. Practical implications: Instead of focussing on selecting board members based on demographic (surface-level) diversity, selections should be based on the interplay of the experience, expertise and background demographic characteristics of the potential candidates. Otherwise, the minority members might face a "token" status. Originality/value: The results of this paper suggest that there is a positive association between board diversity and firm innovation. Future research should examine why this link exists. Therefore, the paper concludes with a research agenda for the benefit of potential further studies. (c) 2020, Teemu Makkonen.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and other questionable business incidents that appear to harm stakeholders frequently afflict firms yet draw disparate investor reactions. We address this disparity by investigating the association between firm legal orientation and investor reactions to CSI. We hypothesize the proportion of board members and top management team (TMT) executives with law degrees affects investor perceptions of firm foresight, and in turn, their judgment of blame and consequent punishment. Based on abnormal returns to 629 announcements of CSI and 308 publicly traded S&P 500 firms, we find that both too small and too large a proportion of board of directors and TMT members with law degrees lead investors to mete out harsher punishment. This inverted u-shaped link is further affected by firm size, firm risk, and industry competition. Our investigation sheds light on the link between executive education and financial performance in the context of CSI and investor perceptions of foresight. (c) 2020 W.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationships of corporate social responsibility, management characteristics, namely; board size and meetings, and audit characteristics, namely; audit quality and audit report lag with corporate performance among the manufactured companies in Saudi Arabia. A Pooled Ordinary-Least Square OLS regression is utilized to estimate the associations proposed in the hypotheses on 180 firm-years observations (2015-2017) from annual reports. The study finds that corporate social responsibility, board size, board meetings and audit quality are positively associated with corporate performance. Additionally, this study reports an inverse association of the audit report lag with corporate performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to corporate social responsibility in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the disclosure quality of their social responsibility, board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article studies the impact of the Board of Directors (BOD) on financial reporting quality (FRQ) in Vietnam listed companies. The research uses FEM, REM and GLS regression models, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010-2018, with 2162 observations. The research results have found that the BOD size, BOD independence, BOD chairperson cum CEO has a positive impact on FRQ while BOD meeting frequency has a negative impact on FRQ. In addition, the audit quality, the ratio of liabilities has a positive impact on FRQ while company size has a negative impact on FRQ. Further, the percentage of female BOD members does not have an impact on FRQ. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to improve FRQ by considering of factors of the board of director in a more effective manner. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

This paper study the relationships between corporate governance mechanisms and cash holdings, and the joint effects on firm performance. We test if these governance attributes are related to cash holdings among firms in the hospitality industry. Our sample consists of public listed hospitality firms in Malaysian and Singapore from the year 2005 to 2013. Different from the past literature which mainly adopted the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) model, this study uses panel regression tests to test the link between the variables and the cash holdings level. We adopt the generalized method of moment (GMM) estimation to control the possible endogenous problem. The results indicate that board of director characteristics plays a pivotal role in cash holdings. We find that board independence, board duality, board busyness and ownership structure are significantly associated with the cash reserves. We find that although the relationship between good governance and corporate liquidity are not significant during crisis in general, the benefits are more pronounced during sudden crisis (Cobra type). The impact of such crisis is found to be significantly alleviated for firms with high cash holdings and good governance. The findings should provide valuable information in developing strategies on cash management. This study provides insight on the importance of the disciplinary and monitoring role of boards of directors. (c) 2020 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.

This study aims to examine the good coiporate governance which is proxied with managerial ownership, the proportion of independent board of commissioners, the size of the board of directors and institutional ownership of coiporate performance through capital structure. The sample is a non-financial corporation listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 20IS and obtained the number of samples as many as 120. The analysis tool uses a path analysis. The results show that managerial ownership, the proportion of board of commissioners, and the size of the board of directors have a significant positive effect on the company performance. Meanwhile, an institutional ownership has a significant negative effect on the company performance. The result also finds that capital structure can mediate the effect of managerial ownership, the proportion of independent board of commissioners and the size of the board of directors on the company performance company However, it cannot mediate the influence of institutional ownership on the company performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

This paper analyzes the impact of four attributes of the board of directors on the performance of 101 non-financial companies from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, during the period 2011-2017. In addition, this research innovates by exploring the lagged effect of the above attributes in order to address the inverse causation that has been highlighted in the literature. The estimation of static and dynamic panel-data models reveals a positive effect of board independence on the accounting performance of the Brazilian and Chilean firms. The evidence reported is mixed in terms of the CEO duality, whereas a positive, quadratic, and concave relationship was found for board size. Finally, no supporting evidence that gender diversity results in a higher current and future performance of Latin American companies was found. (c) 2020 Universidad ICESI.

Large companies seek to improve their legitimacy through the disclosure of information about their non-financial management in corporate social responsibility (CSR). However, the relationship between the board structure and a greater disclosure of environmental and social indicators, given an ownership structure and a level of corporate reputation, has not been studied, especially in emerging economies. Using a debate between agency and resource dependence theory with a sample of 115 companies listed in Merco Colombia, this research concludes with a multivariate analysis that size, independence, and ethics, governance and sustainability committees affect the disclosure in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) on CSR in non-family businesses with a strong reputation.

This paper examines the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on intellectual capital disclosure. Using data of 27 non-financial listed Tunisian firms, the current study provides evidence in support of the nonlinear relationship between corporate governance and Intellectual capital disclosure. The empirical results show that the structure and the way the board of directors' functions are systematically significant factors determining intangible capital disclosure. The empirical tests indicate that managers, majority shareholders as well as institutional shareholders have a significant effect on the informative transparency of intangible capital. These results seem to corroborate the view that an increase in corporate governance mechanisms has a positive effect on voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, tests of the nonlinear hypothesis show that an increase in the number of board members up to nine, and an increase in the number of majority shareholders up to 67% have a beneficial effect on intangible disclosure. However, as these variables increase beyond a turning point, the effect inverts and cuts off the improvement of voluntary disclosure of intangibles. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: To date, there has been little research about the degree of correspondence between partner equity ownership and partner representation on boards of joint ventures (JVs). It is generally assumed that partners' share equals board representation in percentage. This paper aims to explore various instances of deviation from the above norm. Design/methodology/approach: Using a unique database of 259 JV contracts extracted from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and by drawing from resource dependency and transaction cost theories, this manuscript explores the factors that increase or decrease the deviation between equity share and board representation. Findings: The results show that international JVs (IJVs) tend to deviate more, while JVs with a deadlock clause, a large board and based in a stable country deviate less from the degree of correspondence between equity share and board representation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the alliance and governance literatures by identifying factors that influence the degree of correspondence between partner investment (equity share) and control through board of director representation.

By analyzing the literature regarding the peculiarities of the Corporate Governance (CG) structure and their impact on the companies' performance, it is possible to understand that the characteristics of the CG, especially of the Board of Directors (BoDs), strongly affect companies. Particularly, it is renowned that the diversity of members, as well as their identity, can influence the obtainable results. Among all different kinds of diversity, the gender element was chosen in the present work, because although it has been studied by several scholars, its relationship with the companies' performance still remains partially unexplored. Furthermore, other important personal characteristics of members of BoD are considered in the present study, in line with how it is represented in both organizational and professional identity theories. Starting from another work done by the authors (Tutino et al., Corporate governance, CSR and financial performances: what types of relationships exist between these dimensions? In: Corporate governance: search for the advanced practices, pp 231-240. https://doi.org/10.22495/cpr19p12, 2019), where was studied what characteristics of BoD could influence the performance, the aim of this paper is to analyze the diversity of the BoD' members, with the focus on gender, as well as to verify if in the world of "women in business," some characteristics (as knowledge, skills, personal characteristics, level of education) are determinant and influence the thought process of directors and how they make decisions, which can impact strategy formulation, therefore the performance of companies. To understand how the personal features of the members of BoD could be more perceivable regarding both the financial and CSR policies, the work is carried out using quantitative analysis on the data of the most capitalized Italian listed companies on December 28, 2018. The findings demonstrated that the ones who are more interested on the topic of sustainability inside the Board are women that have recently joined the board, whose education is in the area of engineering. On the other hand, the members that give more attention to financial performance are men that have been on the board for a long period, despite their age, who belong to the audit associate profession. The value of the present work is represented by the possibility of bridging the gap highlighted above, with reference to the relationship between the corporate governance structure and company performance. Another important aspect brought to light by this study concerns the specific characteristics of the board members that most influence strategic decisions and therefore performances.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This study investigates the effect of gender diversity in firm's boards of commissioners and board of directors, board size, CEO gender and independent commissioners gender on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) measured by the level of CSR disclosure. The sample comprised of 130 listed manufacturing companies in 2014. Using multiple linear regressions, the result shows that the gender diversity in boards and the size of the board of directors both have a positive effect on CSR. Meanwhile, the other variables have no effect on CSR. The results imply the important role played by the corporate governance mechanism in terms of the gender diversity and board of director's size on corporate social responsibility.

This research explores the interfirm interlock networks that currently exist among publicly traded media conglomerates operating in the United States of America. Directorship information was gathered from annual reports and definitive proxy reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for 68 media conglomerates across seven media sectors for year ending 2018. This investigation applies social resource theory to assess the social networks formed by interfirm interlocks among media conglomerates and how such network structures address environmental uncertainty. Results indicate that not all alliances are mutually beneficial and those that are more resource-dependent endure negative cooptation effects. Moreover, today's financial interlocks look very different than they did at the turn of the century. This research discusses how these changes in interfirm interlocks have resulted in directorship wars. Practical implications are discussed.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

The role of business sector in addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is increasingly recognised around the world. The SDG 5 Gender Equality has given impetus to actions in many countries in the form of gender equality and gender diversity in businesses. Rapid progress has been made recently in achieving gender representation on corporate boards with voluntary initiatives such as the 30% Club in Australia and other countries. This study differs from previous studies in that it considers the ethical and social dimensions rather an economic angle by examining the association between gender diversity and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The limited prior research with this approach has focused on the US and UK context with emphasis on analysing how female directors with their unique views, perspectives and specific experiences contribute to strategic decision making and for addressing issues that are of concern to society and stakeholders. Continuing in this vein, this study examines the association between gender diversity and positive and negative dimensions of CSR separately. For a sample of constituents of the ASX 300 Index and employing systems Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methods, this study finds evidence supporting both the token theory and the critical mass theory. Both positive and negative dimensions of CSR are unrelated to gender diversity when there is a token female representation on the boards of directors. However, companies that have improved gender balance undertake more positive CSR activities and reduce negative or controversial activities that hinder CSR. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Corporate governance is being acknowledged by almost all kinds of business communities and firms as an ultimate driver to improve the firm financial performance. This study examined the association between corporate board structure and corporate financial performance using a dynamic panel model. Principles of corporate governance deliver an explicit board structure for the purpose to facilitate the board members, which helps in making good decisions. The board of directors consists of the CEO, the chairman, the internal directors, and the external non-executive directors to work for the shareholders. This study undertakes different corporate governance attributes including non-executive directors, board size, and CEO duality and examines its effect on firm performance. The dynamic panel model is used, and preestimation and postestimation tests were conducted for the validity of the model. This study found a significant effect of board size, CEO duality, and non-executive directors on firm performance. The findings show that most of the governance variables are endogenous by nature. Results are consistent with agency theory. This study provides the theoretical and empirical evidence and applies a superior model (dynamic panel model) to better explain the association between corporate board structure and corporate firm performance in listed firms.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance. In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors' prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Management published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Academy of Management

The purpose of this research is to synthesise and critically evaluate the extant literature investigating the role of board of directors as a core element of corporate governance in corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Adopting a systematic review approach, a sample of 67 studies from 18 highly regarded scholarly journals published between 1992 and 2020 is examined. Distinguishing between two board attributes of director characteristics and board structures, our study uncovers similarities and inconsistencies regarding the effects of various board characteristics and board structures on CSR performance. First, our study reveals that these attributes do not work in isolation but interact with each other and the context in which they are embedded in shaping CSR performance. Additionally, our review identifies substantial variation in conceptualisations, theoretical frameworks, the use of measurements and the contexts across studies providing a basis to offer a comprehensive synthesis of dominant scholarly discourses and an organising lens for future scholarship.

This paper examines and compares the relationship between risk disclosure and corporate attributes in Islamic and conventional banks. Using a comprehensive risk disclosure index covering nine dimensions, we analyse the level of risk-related disclosure (RRD) in a sample of 72 Islamic banks and 97 conventional banks across 11 countries. The RRD index shows that Islamic banks disclose less information about risk comparing to conventional banks. Listed banks, larger banks and aged bank disclose more information about risk than the others. Block holders, foreign ownership and board size affect negatively risk disclosure. However, board independence and the percentage of foreign directors in the board affect positively risk disclosure. Moreover, banks with higher Tier 1 ratio disclose less information about risk. Our results encourages regulators to improve corporate governance mechanisms in their banking systems through the optimization of ownership structure (dispersed ownership) and the board's composition in order to promote higher level of transparency and RRD.

The literature on gender diversity in boards of directors has expanded significantly in recent years, due to the fact that women are increasingly holding higher management positions within the company hierarchy, clearly demonstrating that certain characteristics of women have a positive impact on different areas within the company. The objective of this paper is to analyze scientific articles on the presence of women in boards of directors, based on a literature review, in order to learn about the evolution of this concept over time. The search conducted for this paper produced 300 documents from the Web of Science, with a final total result of 168 documents after passing the initial results through various filters. VOSviewer software was used to analyze the information, which enabled the creation of bibliometric citation, co-citation and co-word maps. The results reveal the most relevant authors and studies on this subject and identify the most current studies, the main topic of which deals with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in addition to highlighting the characteristics of women that are of vital importance to boards of directors within the current context: empathy, open innovation, concern for the needs of interest groups and a heightened perception of risks.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand the circumstances under which board behavior is affected by gender diversity. The "reasoned action approach" is used as a lens through which to assess the extent that the behavior of the board varies with its gender diversity. Research Findings/Insights: The study uses archival data from a panel sample of 80,395 directorships observed between 1998 and 2012. Boardroom gender diversity is significantly related to director personal responsibility (board attendance), CEO accountability, and risk taking. Our findings highlight the key importance of the exposure of male directors to women directors on boards beyond the focal board. This suggests a positive externality or a spillover effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The empirical findings of this study highlight the importance of allowing for the operation of social norms when studying boardroom decision making. Experience gained by male directors of working with women directors on other boards, beyond the focal board, is shown to enable women directors to contribute more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers encouragement to policy makers' intent on increasing the presence of women on corporate boards. These results point to a spillover effect: there is an observed impact of women on boards that acts not only directly on the board on which they sit but also through the network of boards on which their male counterparts sit.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

Using resource dependence theory, we analyze board interlocks, their industry origin, and their relationship to firms' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Interlocks create connections by having board members from one firm sit on other firms' boards, providing an avenue for sharing information and resources to aid in knowledge transfer and capability development. As firms face challenges for improved GHG emissions performance, they may look to their board members' connections to other firms to acquire needed resources. Using a sample of US Standard & Poor's (S&P) 1500 firms for years 2009 to 2018, we find that firms with a greater number of board interlocks achieve lower GHG emissions intensity. We also find that boards for the best performing companies have interlocks in the same industry, in other industries, and with firms leading in GHG emissions intensity, especially for firms in higher environmentally impacting industries, as they face greater emissions challenges.

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

This study examines whether and how Chief Executive Officer (CEO) experience and financial expertise affect financial restatements (FR) by investigating a sample of Iranian listed companies from 2008 to 2017. We define experienced CEOs as those who are hired from inside the firm and financial expert CEOs as those who hold an accounting qualification or have work experience as an auditor, chief financial officer (CFO), controller, and or other accounting-related positions. We find that FR is positively associated with insider CEOs (CEOs with more internal experience), and negatively associated with CEO financial expertise. Moreover, we find that CEO experience is negatively associated with FR when the CEO is a financial expert. This result highlights the importance of financial background for senior executives. Further, our results show that insider CEOs can improve the financial reporting quality through reducing FR when they have higher decision-making power. This study contributes to the literature on CEO characteristics and financial reporting. The results provide important implications for policymakers and the board of directors in emerging economies regarding the requirement to appoint top managers with financial expertise.

Research Question/Issue: Despite the importance of political ties to firm strategy and performance, little is known about why and how firms form political ties. This study examines how firm-specific governance structures function as important determinants of the formation of political ties and how the impact of governance structures evolves during institutional transition of emerging economies. Research Findings/Insights: Our empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal data set involving manually coded political ties of listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. We find that business group affiliation and family ownership facilitate the formation of political ties but that such effects diminish as market infrastructures and regulatory institutions develop. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study systematically examines how corporate governance structures affect the formation of political ties. It identifies an overlooked explanation for the dynamics of political ties that resides in the internal governance structures of firms. It contributes to the corporate governance research by demonstrating how governance structures other than the board of directors can provide resources to facilitate strategic actions such as political tie establishment. It also enriches research on corporate governance bundles by showing the interdependence among multilevel governance mechanisms in the context of political tie formation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for business executives interested in managing interdependence with government. While business group affiliates and family firms are better able to link to politicians, such advantages diminish during institutional transition. Hence, group leaders and family owners should consider other political activities to effectively manage political risks as institutions develop. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study empirically investigates the role of political connections in corporate environmental spending. It employs a sample of listed Chinese firms from polluting industries within the 2010-2013 period. Our empirical results show that having politicians as directors reduces the magnitude of discharge fees. We also find that such reductions are more pronounced in firms with a higher ratio of politically connected directors (i.e., listed Chinese polluting firms that are privately controlled). This negative relationship is robust to various model specifications (e.g., a sample of polluting firms after addressing the sample selection bias and reverse causality without an increase in new investment). Moreover, we observe that the negative relationship between political connections and discharge fees is stronger in listed Chinese polluting firms located in more polluted regions. Meanwhile, a polluting firm's incentive to engage in environmental protection, measured by firm-level environmental awards (incidents), alleviates (exacerbates) the negative relationship. Finally, the impact of politically connected directors on discharge levies is explicitly driven by having local officials and officials from the home province as directors.

Research question: This study investigates how boards of directors perceive their roles in Scottish football clubs. With previous studies focusing on amateur and non-profit sport organisations (primarily in Canada, Australia and New Zealand), this research answers the call for more research into board roles and in other sport contexts. Research methods: A qualitative design is adopted and 24 directors of Scottish football clubs are interviewed. Football club directors are a difficult to access population and this research represents a rare opportunity to understand the perspectives of key sport governance informants. Template analysis is employed. Results and findings: Findings show that perceived board roles fall into five categories: control, service, operations, resource co-optation and strategy. Organisational size was found to influence perceptions of board roles in Scottish clubs, while an apparent alignment of interests between owners and managers, and a subsequent reduction in agency cost, has implications for the control role. An integration of stewardship theory and resource-dependency theory is argued to provide a more holistic understanding of board roles in this context. Implications: The study responds to calls for a multi-theoretical approach to board roles research by developing an integrative stewardship-resource dependency theory. The integrated theory is argued to be useful in framing the complex dynamics of board roles in Scottish football. Future research is encouraged to assess whether the stewardship-resource dependency theory can provide an effective framework for understanding board roles in other sport settings.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

In their pursuit to garner resources and support for their IPO, the issuing firms prepare well on all fronts. Corporate governance, specifically board structures, is a critical issue that affects the decision quality and also influences the investors' psyche. Building on theories of agency, resource dependency and signaling, this article attempts to study the effects of presence of foreign directors on firm-specific and board-related characteristics of IPO issuing firms. Adding to the scant literature on national diversity, this study concludes that foreign directors do signal a firm's intent of internationalization and contribute to strengthening corporate governance but national diversity does not translate into IPO returns. Exploring a sample of Indian IPOs issued from April 2001 to March 2017, this study finds that presence of foreign directors on the boards brings about differences in governance mechanisms wherein internationalized boards were found to be stronger on governance front. Larger boards, more committees, less number of related directors, better board interlocking were the benefits that manifested from presence of foreign board members. Issue size and issue price of shares at the time of IPO are found to be significantly higher for firms with foreign directors on their boards reflecting better acceptance among the investors.

This study explores diversity reporting by New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) listed companies, arguing that diversity goes beyond gender and includes differences in age, ethnicity, sexuality, religious beliefs and physical disability. We argue that gender diversity and deep diversity elements (race, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, ethnicity) have a synergistic relationship and that gender diversity objectives cannot be achieved without attaining diversity objectives in these other elements and vice versa. Designing a 30-item diversity disclosures index, this study undertakes a content analysis of the diversity-related disclosures made by 152 NZX listed companies. Analysing diversity-related disclosures in annual and sustainability reports, we find that the NZX listed companies predominantly relate diversity only to board gender diversity. Deep diversity elements at all organisational levels, however, do not receive much attention, with a few exceptions. Our results highlight that female representation on organisational boards has a positive impact on overall organisational gender and other diversity aspects and vice versa. The results of an emphasis on the totality of diversity have important implications for boards of directors, corporate managers and regulators interested in improving the corporate governance and diversity practices in New Zealand organisations.

Prior research has found that characteristics of the audit committee influence the incidence of financial restatements, as does demographic diversity on boards of directors. We draw upon work team diversity research to examine the impact of relations-oriented and task-oriented diversity in the audit committee on the likelihood of fraud-related and error-related financial restatements, respectively. We argue that these two types of demographic diversity work differently through greater vigilance of the audit committee in reducing the occurrence of financial restatements. Using a matched sample of fraud-restatement, error-restatement and non-restatement U.S. firms between 1996 and 2010, we find that relations-oriented diversity is associated with a lower incidence of fraud-related restatements, while task-oriented diversity is associated with a lower likelihood of error-related restatements. We also find that the involvement of audit committee members on other board committees moderates these relationships. We discuss the important role of work team diversity mechanisms in evaluating the effectiveness of board audit committees. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the top management team (TMT) structural power framework, we investigate the relationship between Chief Information Officer (CIO) structural power and forward-looking firm performance. In addition, we examine the contingency roles of market turbulence, industry IT intensity, and operating efficiency in shaping the above relationship. Using a sample of 7,185 firm-year observations and a panel fixed-effects model, we find that CIO structural power is positively associated with forward-looking firm performance (proxied by Tobin's q). Further, our results suggest that the benefits of CIO structural power are higher under greater market turbulence, higher industry IT intensity, and greater operating efficiency. Our empirical results imply that the board of directors should consider endowing CIOs with a higher structural power, especially when an organization faces greater volatility in industry sales, competes in a more IT-intensive industry, and operates at a more efficient level. This research contributes to the RBV literature and integrates RBV and structural power frameworks to offer newer insights into the contemporary role of an important TMT member, the CIO.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of CEO compensation for sample of the US firms. It emphasizes the presence of executive compensation persistence and the importance of CEO power besides performance while setting CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of US firms during the period 2006-2016. It is based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) models to assess the impact of numerous factors on CEO compensation. Findings: The main findings reveal that firm performance proxied by accounting-based proxies, as well as market-based proxies, plays a significant role in explaining variations in levels of executive compensation. Moreover, there is a significant persistence in executive compensation among the US sample firms. The authors also document that poor governance conditions (managerial power hypothesis) lead to high compensation levels offered to CEO. Research limitations/implications: At the end, without a doubt, the analysis has some limitations that prompt the authors to consider future research directions. One future research avenue that can help better explain the effect of firm performance on the CEO compensation is to study this issue using an international sample to determine whether country-level characteristics (e.g. creditor rights, shareholder rights and the enforcement climate) can influence this relationship. Furthermore, it can be worthwhile to deepen the analysis of CEO power and its impact on CEO compensation. It will be interesting to emphasize how the CEO power interacts with the other governance characteristics and some CEO attributes as CEO gender. Practical implications: The paper's findings have implications for practitioners, policymakers and regulatory authorities. First, the findings inform regulators that performance is not the only determinant of CEO pay level. This may warrant increased firm disclosure of the details of the pay structure. Second, the study offers insights to policymakers and members of boards of directors interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance, to better align managerial incentives to shareholder interests. Firms should strengthen the board independence and properly constitute the board committees (compensation, risk, nomination...). Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the CEO compensation determinants. It supplements the classic pay-for-performance sensitivity predictions with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory and managerial power theory. The authors develop a composite index to measure the CEO power in order to test the impact of CEO attributes on CEO pay. Additionally, it verifies whether the determinants of CEO pay depend on firm age and size. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores the impact of board characteristics and ownership structures on the strategic decisions taken for R&D investment. The study employs a sample comprising 1736 firm-year observations of 434 technological firms listed on the Taiwanese Stock Exchange (TWSE) between 2014 and 2017. Contrary to extant research, the findings reveal that board independence plays a crucial role relative to R&D intensity, as strong evidence reflects a positive and significant relationship thereon. Moreover, the empirical results demonstrate negative and significant relationships between CEO Duality, Board size (in big companies), Executive & Manager, Board of Directors and Top Blockholders; ownership structures, and firm R&D intensity. Interestingly, the ownership structure results emerging from this Taiwanese contextual study support, and are consistent with the predictions of the 'entrenchment argument' and are counter to the 'convergence of interest' argument. The findings emerging from this research provide an opportunity for further discussion and analysis regarding corporate governance principles and regulations. Firms seeking to optimize their R&D policy imperatives may benefit from such a study. (c) 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Corporate governance encompasses a multidisciplinary approach, which includes the internal and external factors that affect the interests of a company's stakeholders. The Greek corporate governance framework of listed companies has initially been established in accordance with EU regulation and soft law recommendations, in order to enhance board accountability and transparency, empower shareholders' activism and promote financial disclosure. In that regard, it has recently been reformed by the provisions of Law 4706/2020, aiming mainly: to empower the strategic and supervisory role of the board of directors, by introducing a clear description of the obligations of non-executive and independent non-executive directors and by including the establishment of an "adequacy (internal fit-and-proper) policy" for the appointment of board members. Accordingly, two new compulsory committees are added, the nomination and the remuneration committee, which should entirely be composed by non-executive members and are invested with an advisory role in determining the remuneration policy and proposing board candidates. Furthermore, the adoption of a Corporate Governance Code is rendered substantial for all listed companies. These provisions illustrate specifically the reform of the internal corporate governance structures, which should be implemented having regard to the general principles of transparency and proportionality.

This work aims to analyze the relationship between board independence and financial performance (variables ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q). Two perspectives on independence were used: (a) Law 964 of 2005 (mandatory in the Colombian stock market) and (b) an expanded view that included business relationships (cross-directorships, seniority on the board), financial relationships (compensation packages, ownership participation), and personal relationships (founders, members of the owner family) as factors that limit independence. Regression models (random effects) were used on an unbalanced data panel composed of 69 companies from the Colombian Stock Exchange. The results showed that a more rigorous definition of independence is better appreciated by the market. It was found that board independence does not affect accounting performance (ROA and ROE), but it does affect market performance (Tobin's Q). (c) 2021 Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the effects of a board's diversity on firm financial performance using a sample of 76 companies listed on FTSE100 over the period 2010-2015. This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. (c) 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

Research Question/Issue: Do enforcement actions impact banks' board composition? Based on a unique sample of sanctions imposed on Italian banks by the country's banking supervisory authority from 2009 to 2015, we investigate whether supervisory enforcement actions affect changes at the board level. Moreover, we examine whether changes at the board level after a sanction are effective in reducing the probability of further sanctions in the future. Research Findings/Insights: The findings reveal that sanctioned banks change their board composition following a supervisory sanction. We further test whether these changes improve bank governance and find that, under certain conditions, they may reduce the probability that the board is sanctioned again. Robustness tests confirm the results. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical evidence that supports the role of supervisory enforcement actions in inducing banks to adopt changes at the board level. Given that the relationship between supervisory sanctions and changes in board characteristics is still neglected, we contend that our results may increase the understanding of the effectiveness of enforcement actions in improving board characteristics. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We believe that our results have policy implications by making a clear and concrete contribution to the ongoing debate on the revision of the principles for enhancing corporate governance and banking supervision.

Studies on demand side mechanisms related to experience goods argue that demand is driven by recommendation and reputation. In an auditing context, research showed that both of these mechanisms play an important role in determining partner selection, however, only when the mechanisms are observed in isolation. On this basis, this study raises a concern about whether the mechanisms are mutually exclusive, and if not, how does recommendation and reputation in auditor selection context create an interplay in the process of auditor selection. We test our hypotheses on network data of Danish public companies. Findings from the social network study indicate that auditor selection is a sensitive and complex task for boards of directors, as it is not only driven by either of the mechanisms. Rather, partner selection is driven by the combination of both recommendation and reputation, which creates the interplay and, thus, indicates that the demand mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and should not be observed in isolation of one another.

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Using a sample of 47 Portuguese and Spanish firms for the period 2010 to 2017, the authors study the relationship between female presence on board and firm's accounting (ROA and ROE) and market-based (MTB and Tobin's Q) performance. They find that women on the board of directors is positively related to firm's performance, as well as the gender of the CFO and the proportion of women on the listed key professionals, when we consider the market measures of performance, not being so consistent for accounting performance measures. Results were sensitive to the performance measure used. The results reinforce the political options of European Commission gender established quotas, revealing that in the Iberian countries these quotas are not being effectively implemented, even if results suggest that women on board in fact exert positive influence over market performance. This also led us to think that financial markets may also react in a positive way when the CFO of the company is a woman instead of a man, despite the sample limitations both in terms of gender and number of firms.

Much effort has been expended by the regulators in Jordan to enhance the code of corporate governance (CG); however, the effectiveness of CG mechanisms in monitoring management and enhancing the value of a firm is still a puzzle. This study aims to investigate the impact of CG and cash holdings (CH) on firm value as measured by the market-to-book ratio. The sample consists of all manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the years 2010-2017. The study hypotheses were tested using panel regression analysis. The research findings suggest that CH have a positive association with firm value, supporting the transaction and precautionary motives for holding cash. An interesting finding is that board expertise was found to be negatively associated with firm value. Gender diversity was found to be positively related to firm value, while board size, independence, and frequency of meetings were found to be insignificant. It seems that firms in Jordan regard strong CG mechanisms to be expensive and of little value in mitigating the negative effects of a weak legal system. These findings shed new light on the influence (or the lack of it) of boards in Jordanian firms. Consequently, the study recommends that the regulatory agencies in Jordan should consider improving governance codes and Rules to increase the effectiveness of the board and governance in general.

The role of independent directors has been for years in the spotlight of international studies. This phenomenon, which was initially a prerogative of corporations of English-speaking countries, over the last two decades has rapidly spread across Europe, where several countries have introduced specific regulations, borrowing from international best practices. Board independence is thought to buffer the firms against opportunistic behavior (Masulis & Zhang, 2019). This study aims to analyze how independent directors contribute to the decisional processes within Italian boards of directors and to the development of the firms to which they belong. The research hypotheses were formulated based on bibliometric analysis and then they were validated through both a desk analysis and survey data. Therefore, the hypotheses were first connected to the data included within the Assonime reports on corporate governance in Italy in the last 4 years. Then, a quantitative analysis was conducted through a structured survey, administered to a sample of 65 independent directors of Italian firms and belonging to Nedcommunity, the Italian association of non-executive and independent directors, in order to examine the self-perception of independent directors about their own role and effectiveness. This work, combining the structural and the behavioral views, aims at contributing to the literature concerning the impact and the efficacy of independent directors. The findings confirm that the presence of independent directors has a positive effect on corporate performance, on the protection of shareholders' interests, and especially on the adoption of CSR policies.

The board of directors' diversity plays a crucial role in the firm's decision-making process, which includes risk management. This study proposes a multidimensional index to measure board diversity. We use the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 between 1996 and 2013 to analyse the relationship between board diversity and credit risk. We find an inverse and significative relation between board diversity and credit risk, which means that diversity matters in credit risk, and more diversity leads to less credit risk.

Every year, companies spend billions of dollars in board time and headhunter fees on CEO searches. In fact, by many accounts, the selection of the next CEO is the single most important task of the board of directors. Yet, despite the huge amount of time, money, and attention given to the task, many CEO changes fail, with disastrous consequences for all concerned.With so much at stake, it is natural to ask what companies and their boards can do to increase the odds of success. Illustrated with an abundance of real-life examples from interviews with CEOs, C-suite members, members of the boards, and headhunters supporting CEO searches, The Next CEO explains how boards can improve the odds of success with CEO succession by identifying clear CEO mandates and associated CEO profiles and by selecting CEOs that are fi t for purpose. It further explains how the CEOs of leading corporations effectively take charge and create results, providing a roadmap for incoming CEOs. These ideas are brought to life with case studies and interviews with well-known corporations such as ABB, Alibaba, Freudenberg, GE, Google, HNA, HP, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Nokia, Novartis, Roche, Sony, Tata, and Zurich Insurance.

Attracting the interest of investors and gaining capital during the initial public offering (IPO) is the most important task that a company faces while going public. Management board diversity is the tool that company use to signal their value. The aim of this study is to analyse the relation between the management board composition and the amount of capital gained by Polish non-financial companies going public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange over the period of 2006-2018. The results of multivariate regression analysis show that larger board size and higher level of board diversity in terms of age are statistically significant and are positively associated with the amount of capital raised in IPO by companies. Still, board gender diversity is not an important factor explaining IPO proceeds. Our study reveals that control variables such as company size and listing delay, but not profitability, are correlated with the dependent variable. Copyright (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The goal of corporate spin-offs, as a corporate restructuring technique, is to create better value for both the divesting firm and its subsidiary/division. These corporate transactions lead to the creation of independent, publicly traded entities, which are called spun-off subsidiaries. In this study, we examine the effect of board independence and directors' industry experience on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries by setting two main hypotheses. Our sample includes 123 completed U.S.-based spin-off events during a 14-year long time frame. According to our empirical analysis, we find support for both hypotheses, which appear to be significant and positive. In addition, our moderation analysis shows that the interaction effect of directors' industry experience and board ownership is positive and significant. Based on the arguments of agency and resource dependence theories, this study contributes to the governance literature by proving the significant importance of board of directors (namely, their independence and industry experience) on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries after being separated from their corporate parents. From the managerial contributions aspect, this study tells us that if the board is independent and includes directors with the same industry experience, these spun-off subsidiaries will experience positive change in their market performance. Our interaction effect also shows that if board members are offered more shares on the top of their industry experience, the change in market performance will be stronger.

The objective of this research is to analyze the impact of board interlocking on debt capital cost of non-financial publicly traded Brazilian companies, listed on B3 (Brazil Stock Exchange) between 2010 and 2019. The motivation for this research arose from the Resource Dependence Theory, which states that companies need external resources, including financial capital, which can explain board interlocking. I collected data from Economatica (c) database and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) website. The results showed that companies that share counselors with other firms have a lower cost of debt capital; and when analyzing only companies that practice board interlocking, I found that sharing counselors with companies in the financial sector reduces debt capital cost. In practice, the research may be relevant for companies that have difficulties in their indebtedness structures, as there is evidence that sharing counselors with other companies can minimize transaction costs and facilitate access to credit on better terms.

In this chapter, I analyze the main characteristics of family-controlled firms. In the first part of this chapter, I provide a literature review and the main definitions of family-controlled firms, and in the second part, I introduce the impact that family firms can have on the composition of the board of directors according to the literature. In particular, I highlight that recent studies indicate that family firms pursue different goals from nonfamily-controlled firms. To be precise, they select board members to import the knowledge that may be lacking among family members sitting on the board. In the final part of this chapter, I present the main characteristics of Italian family-controlled firms. I first focus on the geographical distribution and on the role of the industrial districts and then highlight the main sectors in which these firms operate.

The aim of our study is to assess the impact of companies disclosing corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues on stock quotes. The research methodology includes panel regression, text analysis, and analysis of quantitative indicators of information disclosure on the social, environmental, and institutional spheres of the annual reporting of companies. In the framework of this study, a dictionary, which was designed as a library R, was compiled to evaluate CSR indicators based on international standards. The empirical base of the study included data from 16 Russian large listed companies from 2014 to 2018, whose capitalization is more than 60,2%. The results of our study showed that CSR indicators affect the price of a company's shares, so, based on a quantitative analysis, we identified: 3 social indicators (loss of work injury rate and sponsorship costs (sports projects), 6 institutional indicators (duration of work of members on the Board of Directors (less than 3 years and from 2 to 5 years), the composition of independent and non-executive directors, the total amount of remuneration of the board of directors and the head) and 2 environmental indicators (emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere and the total volume of wastewater discharges). Based on the text analysis, it was revealed that the share price is influenced by a more complete disclosure of social issues and the disclosure of information on the environment and the institutional sphere. Quantity number of words and average word length in the text of annual reports. The author's dictionary developed within the framework of this study and the indicators identified, the disclosure of which affects the company's share price, have not only theoretical, but also, to a greater extent, practical significance for top managers of companies and employees involved in writing sustainability reports and annual reports. and they can also be used in further research on the impact of non-financial information on the share price.

The Board of directors is the steering wheel organisations use to achieve their goals and its composition has widely been analysed. This paper will show how the number of former government officials has increased in the board of large Spanish firms over the last two decades depending on the number of former government officials in the board and how regulated the industry is. The results will also show that even though there was a period in which more former government officials joined boards, the numbers have stabilised in recent years due to, among other factors, the increasing concerns in society related to the "revolving doors" behaviours.

This study examines the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and firm financial performance. Existing research has focused on the direct link between a proportion of women directors and firm economic outcomes, thus failing to account for possible mediating factors. Examining a panel dataset of 100 companies listed on the UK FTSE100 in the period 2009-2018, we integrated a set of women directors' attributes as mediators in the relationship between gender diversity and firm financial performance. After controlling for firm characteristics and reversed causality, the research supports the business case for board gender diversity and demonstrates the positive and mediating role of women's attributes on firm performance.

Based on data of all listed insurance companies in Jordan over the period of 2008-2018, the study investigates the effect of chairman of the board of directors (chair) and chief executive officer (CEO) age variation on risk-taking behavior via different chair-CEO age variation proxies. Risk-taking behavior is measured by total risk, a proxy set up on the market's risk perception. Thus, the study finds evidence that the chair-CEO age variation tends to decrease risk-taking practice in Jordan's insurance companies, only if a generation gap exists. It doesn't matter whether the chair or CEO is older. These results are consistent with Goergen, Limbach, and Scholz (2015) and Zhou, Kara, and Molyneux (2019). Different robustness tests (CEO-firm fixed effect, random effect, and dynamic panel estimation) confirm results. Overall, this study contributes to corporate governance literature; thus, enhancing the internal corporate governance mechanism is essential. Finally, it has a practical implication for stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers. (c) 2021 The Author.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Recent regulatory changes in Europe have promoted non-financial reporting practices (e.g., Directive, 2014/95/EU) and gender diversity in decision-making positions. Special attention is devoted to promoting the gender balance on corporate boards as a key mechanism to enhance corporate governance effectiveness and better address multiple stakeholders' needs. With this in mind, this study intends to examine the impact of boardroom gender diversity on Environmental Social Governance (ESG) disclosure practices in the European listed firms' context. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies different panel data models on an extended sample of 1,392 firms from 21 European Union (EU) countries for six years (2014-2019). Findings: Findings allow to spotlight the positive role exerted by the presence of women directors on the boards in enhancing ESG disclosure, both at the overall and specific (individual ESG scores) level. Research limitations/implications: Policymakers and regulators might consider the study's evidence as a stimulus to continue in promoting strategic actions and reforms that foster gender equality and balance in corporate decision-making positions. Practical implications: Creating a heterogeneous and diversified board of directors may support implementing a "sustainable corporate governance" recently claimed by the EC. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by disentangling the links between gender diversity and ESG disclosure over a period that covers a long season of European regulations and measures that affected both non-financial reporting practices and the board of directors' composition. Accordingly, it can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the pivotal role that gender diversity may exert in strengthening corporate governance and, in turn, corporate transparency and accountability behaviours about non-financial issues.

Purpose: The purposes of this paper are: firstly, to assess the disclosure related to climate change (CC) by major European banks to understand if the banks have grasped the most substantive aspects of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and secondly, to evaluate the contribution of a non-traditional committee (i.e. corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee) to TCFD-compliant disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: Using content analysis and ordinary least squares regressions on a sample of 101 European banks, this study sought to investigate completeness, tone and forward-looking orientation of CC disclosure and explore the relationships between CSR committee and previous disclosure aspects. Findings: This study shows that European banks have been able to reach an intermediate level of adequacy of compliance in terms of completeness of information but forward-looking orientation seems to be the aspect that needs the most improvement. The existence of a CSR committee dedicated to sustainability issues seems to constitute the difference between the banks in terms of disclosure. The results highlight vulnerabilities in disclosure and board characteristics relevant for improving CC disclosure. Practical implications: Firms interested in strengthening stakeholder engagement and capturing strategic opportunities involved in CC should be encouraged to establish a CSR committee and appoint female directors in financial companies. This paper should be of interest to policymakers, governance bodies and boards of directors considering the initiative of corporate sustainable governance complementary to Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting by the European Commission. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior study has investigated the relationship between the CSR committee and the application of the TCFD's recommendations in the European banking industry.

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

This exploratory qualitative inquiry examines the perspectives of 26 board members in medium-sized, privately held companies operating in the United Kingdom. The study question investigates how digital technologies (DT) are impacting on board director capabilities. Different board members' experiences from their own perspectives are examined, with attention on capturing the influence of digital technologies on the way that board directors work. Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors' capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm's interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper is an empirical study of the effect of the characteristics of the Sharia supervisory board (SSB) on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using 42 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Islamic banks outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and non-Islamic countries during the 2011/2018 period, a random-effects generalized lease square method for the regression analyzes is applied. Findings: The obtained results show that the characteristics of the SSB affect the financial performance of Islamic banks. The results also affirm that a large-sized board of directors and the number of SSB meetings improve banking performance while the cross-mandate seems to destroy it. On the other hand, the SSB members' competence and reputation and the proportion of women sitting in SSB have no impact on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives a comprehensive literature survey on the effect of the characteristics of the SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Practical implications: This study offers insights into the practitioner and Islamic banking regulators interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies that investigate the effect of the characteristics of SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks in particular in Islamic banks in the MENA region outside the GCC and in non-Islamic countries.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: The present study aims to examine the relationship between corporate governance factors and financial reporting transparency pre and post of ISIS. Design/methodology/approach: A multivariate regression model was used to test the hypotheses for this purpose. The research hypotheses were tested on a sample of 35 companies listed on the Iraqi Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2018 using a multivariate regression model based on panel data technique. Findings: The results indicate a negative and significant correlation between the board independence, audit committee independence, management team stability and remuneration of the board of directors and financial reporting transparency. In contrast, there is a positive and significant correlation between the board expertise, audit committee expertise and managerial ownership, with financial reporting transparency. Moreover, ISIS has had a direct and significant impact on the correlation between the board of directors' independence and remuneration with financial reporting transparency. The present study also tested research models using additional methods (such as feasible generalised least squares, ordinary least squares, random effects and T + 1) to obtain better results. The results of these different methods were entirely in line with the main results of the research. Originality/value: The political and economic instability resulting from the entry of ISIS into Iraq has created severe problems for society's economic, political, security and performance dimensions. Macroeconomic uncertainty driven by terrorist activities can negatively affect managers' perceptions of firms' future performance and result in poor judgments and estimations, significantly impacting business units' financial reporting transparency. Because no study has examined the relationship between corporate governance and financial reporting transparency on the Iraq stock exchange before and after the presence of ISIS, this study examines such a relationship. Although the economic and political situation in Iraq may not be identical to that in other nations, much of the experience in Iraq is anticipated to apply to other countries in the region.

Purpose: This study investigates the effect of the board of directors on financial performance and company capital, either directly or indirectly with the risk management in Indonesia. Design/methodology: This study presents an empirical investigation with samples of 31 nonfinancial companies out of a total population of 48 listed on the Indonesia stock exchange for the period from 2010 and 2016. The sampling method used was purposive sampling. Methods of data analysis in this study used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings: The results of the SEM model find that there is a significant positive effect of risk management and the tenure-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on financial performance and company capital. However, CEO duality has a significant negative effect on financial performance. The results also find that the effect of CEO duality and board size are significantly positive on financial performance through risk management. Originality/value: This is the first-time paper to seek to influence the effect of the board of directors, financial performance, and company capital, either directly or indirectly on risk management in Indonesia.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the indirect relationship between board gender diversity and capital structure decisions and to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French non-financial listed companies over the period 2006-2019, this paper uses structural equations modeling, difference-in-differences using propensity score matching and chow test to highlight these effects. Findings: This paper finds that the relationship between the board gender diversity and the capital structure is mediated through the information transparency channel and firm risk taking channel. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of board gender diversity on capital structure decisions varies through the approach adopted (voluntary, enabling or coercive). Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the study is to the knowledge the first to examine whether and how board gender diversity affects capital structure decisions through two mediations channels, namely, the information transparency and the firm risk taking. Second, the study is one of the first to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom: coercive, enabling or voluntary approach.

The behavioral theory of corporate governance is employed to investigate the relationship between managerial entrenchment and corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement. Effective corporate governance is argued to reduce managerial entrenchment, thereby increasing CSR engagement. The role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is investigated as a moderating variable in this relationship, such that high levels of EPU will increase the impact of entrenchment on CSR engagement. These arguments are supported using a panel of 386 US firms from 2011 to 2018 representing 3,088 firm-year observations in a variety of industries. In supplementary analysis, the CSR measure is disaggregated in order to provide further insight regarding these relationships as they pertain to the individual CSR dimensions under study. Findings inform research regarding the entrenchment-CSR link in particular environmental contexts. Practical implications include potential governance guidelines for boards of directors; stakeholder management given the policy environment; and the impact of government decisions as they affect policy uncertainty, firm actions, and CSR engagement.

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct and indirect relationship between board gender diversity and corporate tax avoidance using corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a mediating variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel dataset of 200 French firms listed during 2007-2018 period. The direct and indirect effects between board gender diversity (BGD) and tax avoidance were tested by using structural equation model analysis. Findings: The results indicate that the presence of women on corporate boardrooms negatively affects tax avoidance. The greater the proportion of women in boards, the lower the likelihood of tax avoidance practice. In the mediation test, CSR appears to partially mediate the link between women on boards and corporate tax avoidance. Additional analysis shows that the social dimension of CSR produces this mediating effect. Practical implications: The results have practical implications for companies in regulating the composition of their boards. To benefit from diversity, firms have to increase women's percentage in their boards of directors. Also, investors are encouraged to pay attention to the percentage of female directors when investing and purchasing shares. Social implications: This study proved empirically that the higher proportion of female directors significantly reduces the possibility of tax avoidance either directly or indirectly through enhancing CSR performance. The findings show that firms with gender diversified boards are more likely to get involved in CSR for hedging against the potential consequences of aggressive tax avoidance practices. In light of the above results, firms are well-advised to strongly apply the policy encouraging or mandating women as board members to take advantage of their expected benefits. Originality/value: The originality of this paper consists in proposing the establishment of both direct and indirect relationships between BGD and corporate tax avoidance through CSR. Unlike prior studies that have been examining the direct relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate tax avoidance, this study went further to investigate the indirect relationship between these two constructs. This study also differs from prior studies as it examines the effect of BGD on each of constituting pillars of CSR, namely, environmental, social and governance. To date, an extensive part of CSR research has used the combined score of CSR, but the effects on different CSR pillars remain little investigated. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light an important limit of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in pursuit of its substantial purpose, which is to achieve sustainability and contribute to achieving the objectives of United Nation (UN) Agenda 2030; the paper also suggests how to overcome those limits. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey of board members of listed and un-listed Italian companies. Data were analysed using an ordered probit model. Findings: The results show that a greater involvement of a board member in the non-financial reporting process is associated with a stronger commitment towards sustainable development. Specifically, the involvement in materiality assessment is positively associated with more proactive behaviours towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-reported assessments on beliefs and behaviours and the application of an online survey are methodology limitations of the study. Regarding theory, the study contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability, integrating upper echelons theory, which focuses on how individual attributes influence a firm's strategies and governance, with research on how leadership practices can have a positive impact on corporate sustainability goals. Practical implications: The paper underscores the opportunity for policymakers to increase the effectiveness of the NFRD through deeper involvement of the board members in the process of non-financial reporting. The results could also be of interest to governance bodies in terms of defining a board's tasks and practices to encourage the adoption of behaviours oriented towards a stronger engagement in sustainable issues. Originality/value: This is the first study to provide evidence of the relationship between individual directors' tasks and behaviours, non-financial reporting and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study highlights some of the limits of the NFRD, even after the public consultation to revise it, and suggests how to overcome these limits. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the effect of dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on Islamic banks' liquidity creation. We also investigate whether managerial ability is a channel through which such governance mechanisms influence liquidity creation. Using data for 110 Islamic and conventional banks from 11 countries for the period of 2005-2015, we find that better Shariah supervisory board (SSB) governance increases on-balance sheet liquidity creation but decreases off-balance sheet liquidity creation. This result is robust to an analysis of subsamples, to individual governance attributes, to interactions of dual governance mechanisms, and when controlling for endogeneity issues. Our results reveal that both SSBs and regular boards of directors affect liquidity creation by enhancing managerial ability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Diverse perspectives and ideas among senior leaders (top management teams and boards of directors) might generate substantial value for organizations. In theory, such diversity could provide a foundation for creative insights, innovative strategies, and strong organizational performance. Unfortunately, empirical research on these and other possible outcomes has generated a complex array of confusing findings. Our systematic review, the first to consider all types of relevant studies, attempts to make sense of the complicated landscape. On the negative side of the coin, the review highlights unsolved theoretical puzzles, severely fragmented empirical studies, and methodological conundrums. As a result, it calls into question several widespread assumptions and practices. On the positive side of the coin, our work surfaces some important pockets of consistency in existing empirical findings, mostly driven by studies using direct measures of cognitive diversity among senior leaders rather than demographic proxies. Our recommendations for the future include dramatically increasing qualitative research to move beyond a powerful deductive straightjacket that seems to exist. We also recommend taking a finer-grained approach through a substantial narrowing of quantitative research in the near term to better capture and understand key concepts, measures, and boundary conditions.

This study examines two dimensions of diversity on the board of directors (BOD) and the sharia supervisory board (SSB), namely, gender diversity and educational diversity, and their influence on risk taking by Islamic banks. The study extends the literature by examining whether the influence of gender and educational diversity on Islamic banks' risk taking differs based on whether the bank is publicly listed. Based on a sample of Islamic banks in twenty-six countries, the findings suggest that greater representation of women on the BOD decreases the insolvency risk at listed Islamic banks and that the educational diversity of BOD and SSB members has a significant influence on Islamic banks' risk taking, conditional on whether they are publicly listed. The results are robust to market-based risk measures and the use of a difference-generalized method of moments estimator and propensity score matching technique. (c) 2021 The Authors

This study contributes to the literature of women on boards of directors by showing how female board representation affects the board's involvement in the strategy of employment downsizing, and whether the downsizing strategy mediates female directors' influence on firm performance. We examine data of Taiwanese 1329 manufacturing firms over the 1996-2017 period and apply dynamic panel methods to deal with the endogeneity problems contained in the mediation model. Evidence on the gross effect of women on boards supports our contention that in Taiwanese socio-cultural context, the cognitive frames and human capital female directors bring to boards can improve the firms' accounting-based performance; however, investors' ingrained bias against women may dilute the positive impact and lead to unfavorable stock market reaction to the firms with female directors. Focusing on the indirect mediating effect, our results indicate that perhaps because female directors' leadership style and core values provide boards with more stakeholder-oriented perspectives, the firms with more women directors tend to implement less downsizing, and such talent-retaining strategy is beneficial to firm performance. This positive indirect effect is investors' bias-free, that is, women on boards can be leveraged for higher accounting returns and stock market valuation through their involvement in downsizing.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study examines the effect of non-financial variables related to governance on the accuracy of financial distress prediction among Egyptian listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by using the logistic regression technique. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a sample of 24 Egyptian-listed SMEs in each year, totaling 120 firm observations, of which 25 were classified distressed and 95 of them non-distressed between 2014 and 2018. The variables for the study included five financial variables and thirteen non-financial variables related to governance. The models were developed using financial variables alone as well as combining financial and non-financial variables related to governance. Findings: The results showed that the model with financial variables had a prediction accuracy of 91.7%, whereas models with a combination of financial and non-financial variables related to governance predict with comparatively better accuracy of 92.7 and 93.6%. Research limitations/implications: Although the results seem to be conclusive, it could be noted that the non-distressed sample was not paired with the distressed sample. Other studies showed that paired samples increase the financial distress prediction rate. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, this study was unable to create a hold-out sub-sample for the accuracy test. Practical implications: The proposed distress prediction model for SMEs is effective for stakeholders, including banks and other financial institutions, in the assessment of the credit risk of SMEs. Using such a model, they could better identify SMEs with a higher risk of failure in their lending decisions. Moreover, SME managers' could be interested in using such models as a tool for planning corrective action, in addition to planning and controlling current operations to avoid financial failure in the future. Originality/value: This study contributes to financial distress prediction literature in different ways. First, few studies were conducted in the area of financial distress among SMEs. Second, neither of these studies was conducted within the Egyptian context, nor any of them had used non-financial variables related to governance in the prediction of financial distress among SMEs.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: Despite the rather adequate physical and human resources available to Iranian state-owned enterprises (SOEs), they have proved not only unproductive and unprofitable but also corrupt in cases due to their corporate governance (CG) systems. This study aims to identify the most important challenges faced within designing, implementing and operating such systems in Iranian SOEs. Design/methodology/approach: A judgmental sampling technique was adopted for the purposes of the present qualitative study to select a heterogeneous group of interviewees in terms of experience and expert knowledge in CG and SOEs. Using 28 semi-structured interviews and the thematic analysis methodology within an exploratory approach, the themes/challenges were extracted from the data thus collected that were subsequently analyzed and explicated. Findings: The 16 challenges derived from the data set were subsequently classified into the four categories of "general assembly deficiencies", "contextual issues of ownership", "board deficiencies" and "external managerial constraints". Research limitations/implications: This study aims to provide insights into policy-making systems at both national and international levels to gain a better understanding of the contextual factors that could be exploited toward developing and/or reforming CG codes. To improve SOEs, this study also suggests four main solutions to the CG challenges faced within Iran and similar centralized economic planning systems. Originality/value: The literature on the topic indicates that while a few theoretical and empirical studies have been conducted on CG of SOEs, no study has ever been conducted on similar Iranian cases. The present study provides ample empirical evidence from the CG systems in a state-controlled and centralized economic system to offer new insights into the comparative CG, especially in a developing country like Iran, where the government is the major player in the economy.

Purpose: This study investigates the relation between the board of directors' attributes and corporate social performance. The authors examine three board of directors: characteristics, size, independence and gender diversity, and how they interact with industry to affect corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multivariate approach to analyze and compare the effects of governance variables on two aspects of corporate social performance, its environmental and social dimensions. Findings: Based on a sample of 983 firm-year observations, our main findings indicate that board independence, size and gender diversity each has a different impact on the environmental and social dimensions of performance, but that industrial sector moderates these effects. In particular, our results show that board member independence is positively associated with the environmental dimension of the performance of all the sample industries, but only has a positive association with the social dimension when the firms are in industries other than those that are environmentally sensitive. For these latter industries, board independence is negatively associated with the social dimension. Board size is positively associated with the environmental dimension for environmentally sensitive industries only and with the social dimension for all the industries examined, with a stronger positive effect on the latter in regard to environmentally sensitive industries. Research limitations/implications: Women directors appear to raise social and environmental concerns within the board, as evidenced by their positive effect on the firms' social and environmental performance, with a stronger impact on the former. Practical implications: Regulators can promote changes to the way Canadian companies select directors for the purpose of achieving sustainable performance while investors will be better informed about the impact of some of the board attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance. Originality/value: This study provides a portrait of the impact of governance attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance of Canadian companies. Given the increasing interest in gender diversity in recent years, this study provides new evidence on the benefits of female board members for the two non-financial dimensions of performance.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

This research examines the impact of board gender diversity on CSR disclosure for Tunisian listed banks during the period 2012-2017. Data for CSR disclosure are collected using the content analysis of the annual reports of the banks. To measure the level of CSR disclosure, we used the grid adopted by Branco and Rodrigues (Corporate Communications: An International Journal 11:232-248, 2006, Journal of Business Ethics 83:685-701, 2008). The results show that board gender diversity affects positively the level of CSR disclosure. This implies that the female representation in the board of directors promotes CSR disclosure by listed Tunisian banks. Furthermore, the level of CSR disclosure is affected positively by the bank size and negatively by the directors independence. The paper contributes to the literature on best practices in corporate governance for financial institutions in emerging markets. The results have implications for banks and policy makers in Tunisia. For banks, it shows the relevance of female representation on boards of directors to meet the CSR reporting needs of the users of annual reports. Policy makers can enforce the presence of women in top management position and more specifically on the boards of directors when drafting corporate governance regulations.

This study provides an empirical investigation of the impact of Corporate Governance (CG) attributes on the environmental and social aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The dependent variables considered for the description of the environmental and social aspects of CSR were determined using the Refinitiv approach, and through the lens of agency, stakeholder, and resource dependency theories. The independent variables were selected based on the literature and involve eight CG attributes, namely: CSR committee, CEO duality, board meeting attendance, board meetings frequency, non-executive board members, board gender diversity, board specific skills, and board experience. The employed methodology was evaluated through a sample of dependent and independent variable data of 313 companies across the European region excluding companies from the Eurozone for the period of 2006-2020. A suite of machine learning models was employed for capturing the most important determinants of the environmental and social aspects of CSR. The results reveal that three main corporate governance attributes may have a significant impact on a company's environmental and social performance. These attributes involve more female directors and directors with low board experience in board positions, and finally, the existence of CSR committees. The derived findings provide significant implications for corporate directors, socially responsible investors, policymakers, and regulators that intend to promote CSR initiatives and strategies.

India has recently witnessed a set of banking frauds, pointing toward the possibility of loose corporate governance mechanisms in the banking sector. The present study aimed to evaluate the composition of the board of directors in terms of the corporate governance parameters to assess whether they impacted the performance of the listed Indian banks. The hypothesis for the same was formulated based on the agency and the resource dependency theory. The study made use of the 34 public as well as private sector banks listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange 500 for a period of 12 years (2010-2022). The analysis was conducted using the STATA software's fixed-effect panel data regression model. The results suggested that board size, percentage of women directors, and percentage of independent directors on the board of banks impacted the financial performance of these banks. The study shed light on the mechanism and ways to improve bank performance using corporate governance parameters. It makes valuable contributions to the literature on corporate governance and shall be helpful for both managers and policymakers in formulating regulatory guidelines.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the potential influence of multiple directorships (MDs) on the firm value of listed firms in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 1,067 firm-year observations of Jordanian listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this study applies a pooled ordinary least squares regression model to examine the above-stated relationship. This technique was supported by conducting a generalized method of moments estimation to address the possible occurrence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The results show a significant negative relationship between MDs and firm performance, thereby supporting the "Busyness Hypothesis", which suggests that directors with MDs are expected to be over-committed, too busy and less vigilant. Thus, their ability to effectively monitor the company management on behalf of the shareholders is quite limited. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in Jordan, and one of the very rare studies in the Middle Eastern and North African region, to examine the relationship between MDs and firm performance. This study provides important policy and practitioner implications in the field of corporate governance by highlighting the necessity of imposing stricter limits on the number of directorships allowed for board directors. Crucially, the empirical evidence implies that limited directorships ensure that directors are able to fulfil their board responsibilities appropriately, which is significantly associated with the firm value.

This article studies, over the period 2006 to 2019, both the structure and the evolution of corporate networks built on shared board directors between the largest listed firms of three European countries: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It offers a longitudinal and up-to-date analysis of the state of links between companies through examining interlocking directorates. Contrary to previous studies which have emphasized a decline of interlocks when analyzed at the board director level, we observe relative stability of these networks at the corporate level with a number of connected firms remaining quite stable despite a decline of board ties. As a result, the most central companies remain mainly the same at the national and international level over the considered period. Our findings provide evidence for the resource perspective: access to key resources seemingly pushes firms to continue their network participation despite strengthened national regulations on directors with multiple board seats. This evolution echoes the concept of weak ties of Granovetter (Am J Sociol 78: 360-1380, 1973). Lastly, it is worth noting that it cannot be affirmed that there has been an emergence of a cross-national network which operates to substitute national board ties.

This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation.

Purpose: Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the association of board busyness and firm productivity. Thus, this paper empirically analyzes how board busyness affects firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach: To measure board busyness, this paper computes the percentage of directors on a board who sit on three or more boards. Furthermore, to calculate firm productivity, the paper employs data envelopment analysis. Findings: Findings demonstrate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity (association) is generally negative and statistically significant but economically insignificant. In this respect, the findings reveal that the association is negative (positive) and both statistically and economically significant for firms having higher monitoring (advising) needs. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that regulatory oversight (1) weakens the general negative association; (2) changes the direction of association from negative to positive, for firms having higher monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the association, for firms having higher advising needs. Originality/value: Taken together, the findings indicate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity is conditional to monitoring/advising needs and regulatory oversight. As such, the findings enrich the current debates on the association. Furthermore, the findings offer novel perspectives to enrich the regulatory frameworks of countries which are constraining multiple directorships. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of corporate governance structures on earnings management behavior in a weakly governed and politically unstable environment. A panel of data from 35 non-bank companies listed on the Palestine Exchange between 2012 and 2019 was employed. A fixed effects regression model was used to examine the impact of certain board characteristics (board size, board meetings, and audit committee formation) and ownership structures (institutional ownership, foreign ownership, and ownership concentration) on earnings management in the volatile and risky political and economic environment of Palestine. The findings indicate that corporate governance and ownership systems in Palestine appear to be ineffective in constraining earnings management practices. None of the board attributes appear to constrain earnings management practices. However, there is weak evidence to show that ownership concentration has some effect in curbing earnings manipulation. The findings of this study are expected to increase awareness among Palestinian regulators, investors, and other policymakers regarding the role of boards of directors and institutional and foreign shareholders in monitoring Palestinian listed companies to enhance corporate governance and the quality of financial reporting.

Many studies on the impact of boards of directors on corporate social responsibility have focused on the human capital of board members (i.e., structures and characteristics). However, the relational capital of board members (i.e., board interlock centrality) has yet to be fully explored. This study examines the extent to which board members are connected in their networks (i.e., board interlock centrality) on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in the restaurant industry. It also recognizes the moderating role of board effectiveness on the relationship between board centrality and CSR performance. On the basis of organization legitimacy theory and resource dependence theory, this study found that high-centrality boards increase positive CSR performance. The effect is more substantial when a firm has more standing board committees. The theories view firms as components of the larger social environment, and their performance depends on their ability to procure crucial resources from other firms through mutual exchange. No significant link was found between negative CSR performance and the moderating effect of board committees. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

The current research is a systematic review of 54 empirical papers from 1996 to 2022 which aim to investigate whether board member age diversity influences a firm's financial and non-financial outcomes. Analysis of the extant research reveals board member age diversity to be an inconsistent predictor of both the financial and non-financial performance of a firm. Apart from CSR performance, which was found to more consistently be positively associated with age diversity, most studies included in the review failed to identify age diversity as a significant predictor of firm outcomes, however several positive, negative and curvilinear relationships were found by some studies. The lack of a consistent trend of significant associations may indicate that age diverse boards perform no better or worse than non-diverse boards or, more likely, given the inconsistent pattern of results, this research highlights that there may be other factors, such as team processes or task characteristics, which differentially impact whether age diversity has a positive, negative, curvilinear or no effect on outcomes. The current work is the first to systematically evaluate the available data on board age diversity and provides a clear account of what is known and what is not known about the relationship between board member age diversity and financial and non-financial outcomes. This study offers important insights and practical recommendations to researchers, HRM practitioners and policy makers interested in understanding how board composition factors influence the performance of corporate boards.

Women's representation on corporate boards has recently drawn increasing attention. This study aims to investigate the moderator role of females on the board of directors on the relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and stock price informativeness. This research uses secondary data obtained from the Sahra database with the span of 158 active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Findings indicated that the presence of female directors on the board had a favorable impact on the correlation between EQ and pricing informativeness. That is, firms with more female board members have a greater association between EQ and stock price informativeness. The practical application of this research relates to female CEOs' monitoring roles, thereby enhancing the quality of financial reporting. (c) 2022, Institute of Economic Sciences.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The current study evaluates how gender diversity impacts the stock price, whether on the audit committee, commissioners, or directors, using firm size as the moderating variable. A total of 240 secondary data samples were derived from 24 publicly listed banking institutions from 2012-2021. The multiple regression and moderated regression analysis used to process the sample research was considered the most suitable for this study. The statistical test in the first model showed that the existence of women executives on the board of directors impacts the stock price. This first model result is in line with the research by Baez, Baez-Garcia, Flores-Munoz, and Gutierrez-Barroso (2018). The gender diversity in the composition of commissioners and audit committees showed that it had not impacted the stock prices. Furthermore, the directors and audit committees affected the stock price in the second model. This result is in line with the research by Qayyum et al. (2021) that demonstrated that the women officers on a company's board could lower crash risk in stock price. Contrarily, the variable in this second model, the board of commissioners, did not impact the stock price. Thus, the second model noticed that firm size, as moderating variable, weakened the impact of the audit committee on the stock price. The current study contributes to the literature concerning the impact of gender diversity in company officers' levels on the stock price. Future researchers can use other samples from other emerging markets countries. Further investigations are urged to broaden the context of the study to achieve more enriched findings.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This chapter discusses corporate governance; they promote governance as a system by which companies and organizations are directed and controlled. Good governance involves a number of aspects that occur in the process of governing. Corporate governance policies and practices define the performance of an organization. The main pillars of corporate governance are accountability, transparency, fairness, and disclosure. The performance of companies and organizations in relation to these pillars determines their overall evaluation in terms of good governance. The definitions of governance and good governance are now folded into a discussion of corporate and nonprofit governance. The boards of directors play a significant role in the overall management and control of corporations and organizations. A corporate board of directors is generally the oversight body that ensures the company's performance meets the owners' or stakeholders' expectations and helps manage/resolve disputes in the process.

Several authors have stated that the board of directors serve as the most crucial internal mechanism for improving a company's performance. On the other hand, prior studies argue that the board did not serve its purpose of safeguarding the stakeholders' interests equally and improving the performance of companies. It has piqued the interest of regulatory organisations all around the world, including in India. However, out of the several reforms introduced in India, board size is one of the most significant. As a result, the present study scrutinises the non-linear influence of board size on the performance of 213 Indian companies for 2001-2019. Tobin's Q and Return on Equity (ROE) are the study's performance metrics. The fixed effect panel regression findings depict that board size has an inverted U-shaped non-linear impact, i.e., initially, the performance improves, but after board size reaches a particular point, it diminishes. Thus, this study supports the recent changes made by the regulatory bodies about board size.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of firm financial and operational characteristics on the level of forward-looking information disclosure (FLID) by Egyptian-listed non-financial companies. The present research also aims to investigate the moderating role of gender diversity on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The sample incorporates the non-financial companies included in the EGX 100 of the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE), whose reports were available during the study period from 2013 to 2018. The final sample comprises 49 companies with 294 observations. Statistical analysis is performed using multiple regression analysis. Findings: This study found a significant positive impact of return on assets, leverage, company size and age on the level FLID, while external audit firm type and industry were found to impact the level of FLID negatively. Further, the board gender diversity (BGD) is found to have a moderating impact as it strengthens the effect of financial and operational characteristics on the level of FLID. Practical implications: The present study has some implications for Egyptian companies, investors in the Egyptian market and regulators in emerging economies, which include paying more attention to BGD when selecting the board members by companies as well as following up the female representation in all the listed companies by regulators. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the moderating role of BGD and its impact on the level of FLID in emerging markets. This extends the disclosure literature as the present study brings new evidence from an emerging market regarding BGD moderating role as early research concentrated on the direct impact of BGD on the level of FLID.

Purpose: The authors examine whether internal corporate governance mechanisms are effective in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities, misclassification, and timing. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises of firms from an emerging market, India with data for years 2004 through 2015. The authors use the methodology given in Roychowdhury (2006). Findings: The authors find that corporate boards in India play an active role in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities but fail to control cash flow manipulation through misclassification and timing. Practical implications: The study suggests that corporate boards should pay more attention to the reported cash flow numbers. Regulators can reduce the opportunities available for cash flow misclassification by fixing relevant accounting and governance norms. Auditors can also help by critically focusing on the cash flow classifications presented by management. Originality/value: This study, to the authors' knowledge, is the first study that talks about the role of internal governance in a trade-off between different cash flow manipulation techniques.

This study investigates the effect of the Chair-CEO chronological age gap on the performance of commercial banks listed on the London Stock Exchange. We examine either the Chair-CEO generational gap (a minimum age gap of 20 years) or the Chair-CEO age difference (+/- or absolute). We find significant evidence for the hypothesis that the Chair-CEO age dissimilarity is likely to increase bank performance. Additional identification attempts include the use of the 2007-2009 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, the positive linkage between age difference and bank performance was more intensified. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

This chapter provides readers some theoretical connections between board busyness and stability of banks. As such, some knowledge about the busyness of the board of directors in the dual banking system (i.e., Islamic versus Conventional banks) will be discussed. This will be followed by the theoretical linkage between Shari'ah governance busyness and banking outcomes. Next, researchers and students will be introduced to some empirical evidence in this field, so that they can better visualise how the theoretical link between board busyness and bank outcomes was empirically examined in academics. Interestingly, this chapter provides researchers and students some good directions for endogeneity problems existing in corporate governance and board busyness research and some suggested methodology that could address such issues.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: This paper examines the evolution and determinants of the extent and quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in a developing country (Mauritius). Design/methodology/approach: CSR disclosures from annual reports of all listed companies were hand-collected for a 12-year period (2007-2018). The extent of disclosure was measured using a dichotomous index (41 items) while the quality of each disclosure item was assessed on a three-point scale. We rely on organisational legitimacy and resource dependence theories to investigate (1) trends in CSR disclosure extent and quality (2) the role of selected board and firm characteristics, namely the business qualifications of board members, extent of cross-directorships and the firm's use of employee volunteering scheme, on CSR disclosure. Findings: CSR disclosure extent, notably in relation to environment and human resources, gradually increased to an overall score of 45%. Comparatively, the quality of disclosures was low, with an average score of 20%. The proportion of business-qualified directors is only positively associated with CSR disclosure extent. The extent of cross-directorships is negatively associated with CSR disclosure quality while employee volunteering is positively associated with disclosure extent and quality. Originality/value: The findings reveal the relatively low quality of information being disclosed, and in spite of CSR and governance reforms, there seems to be limited influence from the board of directors and their networks; prompting a call to foster greater board engagement on CSR matters. The results also highlight the need for a multi-dimensional assessment of CSR disclosure. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) on sustainability disclosure (SD) from the perspectives of resource dependence, agency and stakeholder theories in the context of Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses were based on 405 observations from non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange, spanning the period of 2014-2018. The CG that influences SD was examined using panel data regression models. Findings: The results of the current study show a positive and significant relationship between the extent of SG and the audit committee and board of directors' effectiveness. In terms of ownership structure, both institutional and foreign ownerships yielded an insignificant relationship with the extent of SDs. Practical implications: The analyses have implications for practitioners, policymakers, top management and corporate executives. Firms are encouraged to restructure their board of directors to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better monitor and support better SD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the determinants of SD in Jordan firms. This paper adopted a newly developed global reporting initiative-based reporting index that identifies companies with good sustainability practices. This adds value to the existing sustainability literature. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of human capital related to gender and nationality diversity in boards of directors on the innovation of university spin-offs (USOs) in their entrepreneurial ecosystem. Following the intellectual capital (IC) framework and the resource dependence theory, upper echelons theory and critical mass theory, it hypothesizes that the relationship between board diversity and USOs' firm innovation is non-linear. Design/methodology/approach: To test the research hypotheses empirically, a sample of 827 Italian USOs over the period 2009-2018 was analyzed using zero-inflated Poisson regression modeling. A robustness test was also performed. Findings: Gender obstacles remain in USOs' entrepreneurial ecosystem, with little involvement of women in boards, and the benefits of human capital for firm innovation emerge with increased female representation. Nevertheless, a few foreign-born directors embody valued IC in terms of human capital from an internationally linked entrepreneurial ecosystem, which decreases with more foreign-born directors due to communication costs and coordination problems. Research limitations/implications: The emerging non-linear relationships imply that gender- and nationality-diverse boards in USOs constitute critical human capital factors boosting the devolvement of entrepreneurial processes, in terms of firm innovation, in university entrepreneurial ecosystems. Originality/value: This study contributes significantly to the move from traditional corporate governance analysis through an IC framework, fostering an understanding of the role of human capital and its diversity determinants in spurring firm innovation among USOs considering the university entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Board of Directors Effectiveness (BODE) on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies licensed by the Central Bank of Malaysia. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of Shariah Committee Quality (SCQ) on the relationship between BODE and companies' performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 11 Malaysian Takaful companies during the period of 2010-2017. While BDE and SCQ are measured using indices, performance is proxied using ROA and ROE. A panel fixed effect regression analysis is used to test the impact of the BDE on the financial performance of Malaysian Takaful companies and the moderator role of SCQ. Findings: The main finding of this study shows a positive association between BDE and performance. More specifically, boards with a high presence of independent, Muslim and female directors positively contribute to the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Another interesting finding is related to the positive moderating effect of SCQ on the relationship between BDE and performance. This result indicates that a high level of SCQ combined with a high level of board effectiveness improve performance. Practical implications: The finding is of great importance to stakeholders and policymakers to improve their board effectiveness and the quality of the Shariah committee to reduce agency costs and to improve the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Originality/value: This study adds to the prior literature by investigating for the first time the relationship between BDE and performance and the interaction effect of SCQ on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

Based on a sample of 4,089 multinational companies over the period 2015-2018, this study analyses the role that women leaders play in relation to the implementation of sustainability strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and whether this role depends on the proportion of female presence in management teams. The results show that the commitment to the 2030 Agenda is higher in companies with a woman as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or chairperson of the board of directors, as well as greater gender diversity in both, management teams and the monitoring body. However, the incongruity in the phenomenon of female leadership stereotypes hinders the existence of a complementary relationship that reinforces it. We showed that, consistent with the social role theory, prejudices act as barriers to achieve synergic effects among women in different management positions. (c) 2022 The Authors

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

Based on resource dependence theory we argue for an influence of business groups (BGs) on the board composition of constituent offshore financial multinational enterprises (FMNEs). Using a unique sample of 171 Caribbean FMNEs in an inter-island BG setting, we find BGs' control in constituent firms to be indicative of the importance of the internal financing and intermediation within the group network. This control leads to a higher proportion of lawyers hired to the boards of directors in BG-constituent firms and supports the argument that lawyers provide skills in complex offshore regulatory frameworks that facilitate BGs' optimal tax management. Furthermore, we observe that an increased adoption of shareholder rights governance by BG-constituent firms is associated with increased engagement with outside resource providers, increased potential conflicts of interest and hence a need for hiring more lawyers. Our interpretation is that offshore FMNEs have a need for more lawyers, whose legal skill is critical to the competitive advantage of FMNEs. (c) 2022 The Authors

Although the gender composition of corporate boards and the contribution of female directors to corporate governance have been previously analysed, few studies have investigated the factors that may help contribute to increasing the still scarce presence of women on boards. Therefore, using three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation on a data panel comprising the 100 largest companies in the world according to the 2019 Fortune Global 500 ranking, including data on (re)election proposals for corporate board members, this research aims to analyse the influence of the number of men's nominations, board interlocks, director tenure, geographical area, the sector to which the firms belong, and the relevance of firms on women's nominations for boards of directors. The results show the factors that facilitate the presence of women on boards. In addition, the different influences that remain in the election of female and male directors when considering factors related to the experience, expertise, and networks of directors or the visibility of firms can also be observed. This study contributes to the knowledge of gender diversity on boards, shedding light on the factors that might lead to gender-balanced boards. It could also help companies and policymakers design strategies to build more egalitarian boards. (c) 2023 The Author(s)

Purpose: The existing literature involving director compensation has been concentrating on its absolute or intrinsic values. Although the relevant studies have generated mixed findings, research in other fields suggests that the power of an incentive may be determined by its value relative to the chosen referencing standard more than its absolute value. This study aims to investigate how relative director pay affects corporate investment efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a fresh theoretical viewpoint by framing the investigation using the dimensional comparison theory and proposing that a directorship also presents a relative value that may influence the board's performance. Ordinary least squared regressions and two-stage system generalised method of moments are used to analyse 14,267 firm-year observations. Findings: The empirical results suggest that the relative director pay is a better estimate of the power of the incentive than the absolute pay. A positive association between the relative director pay and investment efficiency is evident, while the absolute pay has no significant effect on investment decisions. Director overcompensation, however, will cancel out the positive effect of director compensation on investment efficiency. Firms with relatively lower unexpected investment (UI) level benefit the most from an increase in the relative director pay, while neither absolute nor relative director pay affects investment choices in firms with a high UI level because of significantly more overcompensation. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the effect of relative director pay. It is also the first to examine the role of dimensional comparison in strategic decisions which is the single untended comparison framework in the director pay design. The current director pay structure has emphasised social and temporal equality by standardising the pay structure and vesting the equity-based pay over a long period. Yet it ignores the fact that people decide their commitment level by comparing the reward with an internal referent too. The findings speak to the dimensional comparison theory in that the inequality emanated from dimensional or internal comparison may be accentuated by the perceived equality in other comparison frameworks, driving the different performances in the roles one assumes.

In this chapter, the impact of board gender diversity on overall firm risk was investigated. Drawing on social identity theory, upper echelons theory, and agency theory, a hypothesis of a negative link between gender diversity on the board of directors and firm risk has been put forward. Using a panel data regression on a sample of large Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) over the period 2016-2020, the author was able to provide empirical evidences supporting the existence of a significant negative impact of the percentage of women on boards of directors on stock return volatility as global firm risk proxy.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of ESG sustainability practices (i.e., Environmental, Social, Governance/economic) on share performance. Moreover, the objective of the study is to investigate the sustainability practices with mediation of board member experience, which might contribute in maintaining the share performance. The study is unique in such a way that instead of analysing the stated relationship with internal financial performance measures such as return on asset (ROA) or return on equity (ROE), this study will investigate the relationship using external performance measures such as firm share performance. In this research, data were collected from 100 Bursa Malaysia listed companies using purposive sampling during the sampling period from 2017 to 2020. The data were analysed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound testing model instead of a traditional regression model to examine the causal relationship. The results of the study showed the long-run steady relationships through the error correction term (ECT) at the optimum lag. Further, the findings also revealed that there is no short run association between the sustainability practices and the stock performance with mediation of the board experience. The findings also showed that sustainability practices have a significant impact on share performance with mediation of board experience. It is found that sustainability practices, especially environmental and social, are essential to attract investors. The results have also demonstrated that a board of directors of different ages has different knowledge, competencies, and expertise which could prove beneficial in terms of board diversity that decides to adapt the best sustainability practices. These findings provide some inference for future research on the relationship of sustainability practices and share performance with other mediating factors of board attributes.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

China is facing an acute portable water problem and presents a picture of severe supply constraints. Thus, China 's water crisis offers attractive business opportunities for foreign water companies as well as domestic private water companies. Hence, the private sector participation in the Chinese water sector is a hot topic. This chapter investigates the impact of gender diversity on board of directors on the financial performance of the Chinese private water companies using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) and unbalanced panel ( random effects ) regression models, which are estimated as the baseline approach on a sample of 19 Chinese private water companies for the period of 2010-2017. The OLS and random effects results show that number of women on board (WB), percent of women on board (%WB), number of female executives (FE), and percent of female executives (%FE) affect the Chinese water companies' financial performance. The results of this chapter are important for researchers, regulators, and policymakers to benefit from policies that encourage board varieties at an individual water company level.

Numerous studies examine corporate boards of directors' composition and firm performance. Far less is known about the factors influencing university boards' composition and university outcomes. This paper fills this void by examining the relationship between university board selection processes and constituent representation, board composition in terms of size and demographic composition, and the influence of board composition on institutional outcomes. We find that institutional sector, Carnegie classification, and wealth predict board size, and that institutions with larger boards tend to have more favorable institutional outcomes. Board gender and racial composition is less correlated with outcomes than is board size. (c) 2023 The Authors. Managerial and Decision Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The present work aimed to shed light on the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on real earnings management (REM) as well as the moderating role of auditor reputation in the association between BGD and REM using panel data of 1162 French non-financial firm-year observations from the SBF120 index during the period 2005-2019. Our findings show that BGD is negatively related to REM. Furthermore, we found that this relationship is more prominent in firms with higher auditor reputation mainly because highly reputable auditors aim to preserve their image and are more likely to detect earnings management activities.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between audit committee (AC) attributes and the risk-taking behavior of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: The study used data generated from the annual reports of 43 full-fledged Islamic banks operating in 15 countries between 2010 and 2020. Findings: The findings indicate that AC size, AC independence and the proportion of AC members from foreign countries have a significant negative relationship with the risk-taking of Islamic banks. However, AC meetings, AC gender diversity and the proportion of AC members with doctorate degrees have insignificantly influenced the risk-taking of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: The study used only six AC attributes out of corporate governance mechanisms likely to affect the insolvency risk of full-fledged Islamic banks between 2010 and 2020. Practical implications: The study sheds light on the effects of AC attributes on the risk-taking of Islamic banks. The findings could allow policymakers and regulators to provide policies and regulations that could improve AC's oversight role in constraining Islamic banks from excessive risk-taking. Besides, this study can guide the board of directors in appointing AC members who can prevent Islamic banks from taking excessive risks. Originality/value: This study provides clear and adequate empirical evidence showing how key audit committee attributes influence the risk-taking behavior of full-fledged Islamic banks.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: The empirical study aims to examine the impact of board diversity with respect to gender and nationality on firm performance in an emerging economy. This research further splits the sample into family and non-family domains and investigates the diversity-performance nexus in isolation. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 183 listed companies in Bangladesh over the period 2007 to 2017. This study employed the generalised method of moments (GMM) technique to address the possible endogeneity issue in the governance-performance connection. To underscore the strength of diversity, three distinctive assessment measures were used: percentage representation of females and foreign directors, the Blau index and the Shannon index. Findings: The results for the full sample models reveal that board heterogeneity regarding both female and foreign directors positively and significantly influences firm performance as measured by return on assets (ROA). Further to this, female directors in family-owned businesses have a positive association with profitability, whereas foreign nationals demonstrate a significant positive association with performance in non-family firms. Additionally, at least three women directors are needed to make a positive difference in profitability; however, a sole director with foreign nationality is capable of demonstrating a similar impact on performance. Practical implications: The findings are significant for policymakers and organisations that advocate diversity on corporate boards of directors, and the minimum number of diverse board members needs to be considered depending on the identity to bring about a significant change in organisational outcome. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to other emerging economies with similar institutional characteristics. Originality/value: This study reinforces the existing stock of knowledge on the impact of board diversity on the profitability of firms, especially in the context of an emerging economy - Bangladesh. Irrespective of the given backdrop, this study finds that both gender and nationality diversity in the case of Bangladesh is found to have a positive and significant effect on financial performance with respect to all the diversity metrics, i.e. the proportionate number of female and foreign directors on the boards, the Blau index and the Shannon index.

Our paper analyses the characteristics of the boards of directors of the best performing listed Italian banks during the last global financial crisis (from 2008 to 2015). Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the study identifies three different board configurations (archetypes) that these banks adopted: a committee-based board, a gender diversity-based board, and a large size-based board. Although different in some of their characteristics, these configurations share the rationale of favouring the advisory services that the board can provide to managers in their decision-making activities. These services, in turn, are particularly valuable in a time of high risk and uncertainty for banks. With its results, the paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between board characteristics and organisational performance and to a better understanding of the configurations that can best serve when firms' decision-making, for various reasons, becomes particularly complex and can benefit from board support. Our results also contribute to further detail the governance characteristics of banks in the Italian context. Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate is an artificial legal person whose hands, eyes, ears are supposed to be the governing board! Yes, the board of directors of a company. It is also very specifically expected that the said 'board' is impartial and fairly dealing with the state of the affairs of the business to discharge its fiduciary duty, i.e., custodian of somebody's trust. But it is very strange that at times inappropriate, all of sudden, it comes to the fore, that the so and so company is yet another victim of fraudulent practices, resulting in its debacle. Straightforwardly, the fraudulent failure of the joint stock limited liability corporate is a direct question mark on the intention of its governing board! In this paper an alarm has been raised to highlight the legitimate aspiration of all those, who are betrayed by such failures! Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

The main objective of the present study is to investigate the board of directors' diversity impact on banks' financial performance. The analysis was made on the Romanian bank system, during 2019 - 2020. The board of directors' diversity was measured through the presence of the woman in the board of directors' structure, average age and the nationality of the board members and the profitability of the bank system was analysed by using the financial indicator ROA (return on assets). The research methodology used was mostly quantitative, with the authors performing a deductive statistical analysis by using a series of testing objectives and potential cause-effect links. The findings of the paper indicate that there is a direct correlation between the board of directors' members average age and ROA, in 2019, and an indirect link with a low intensity between the members' nationality and the bank's profitability, in 2020. Our results provide no evidence for the presence of women on boards of directors and the banks' financial performance. (c) Vilnius University, 2002-2023.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the thematic content of research addressing the relation between board of directors (BoD) and business transformation (BT) to obtain better understanding of status and to derive future areas of study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-occurrence of articles published in Web of Science Core Collection (tm) (WoS) between 1990 and 2022, identifying key concepts, setting network of relations and identifying the strategic importance of clusters of concepts. Findings and implications are discussed, future lines of research are presented and limitations are noted. Findings: Thematic research on boards addressing transformation shifted from the analysis of individuals' traits to an organizational approach with majority of research centered on the role of boards under different theories and the consequences of strategic changes on firm's performance. Further research is around gender diversity, sustainability and the moderating role of ownership structure and business culture. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations are also noted. This analysis considered articles indexed by WoS for Q1+Q2 publications as source of literature, while including others such as Scopus would increase knowledge base. Also, to identify main streams of research, the authors considered keywords with cumulative occurrence spanning from 30% to 40% while increasing this percentage would add terms that might improve precision to the connections among keywords. Other techniques could have been used such as co-citation or bibliographic coupling, although the authors find these as better suited to investigate the basic structure behind the foundational knowledge of the topic while the authors' intention was to understand the positioning of study fields regarding the degree of research progress. Practical implications: This paper presents some practical implications for future researchers. Those who wish to leverage previous evidence to address new research questions might look into principal themes covering BoD dynamics and composition to exert CG, and the relation between strategic decisions and performance measured by different variables. Those who wish to position their research as new findings to shed light on dilemmas, might find opportunities in the fields of climate change-sustainability, R&D for growth and innovation under the perspective of intangible assets. Originality/value: This paper, is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge, to identify research clusters for the intersection of boards and transformation and to determine their stage of development.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and the risk profile of 141 listed banks from 14 emerging countries over the period of 2012-2020. Specifically, this study investigates whether the relationship between gender diversity and banking risk varies between Islamic banks and conventional banks, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second aim is to investigate whether COVID-19 health crisis moderates the effect of gender diversity on banks' risk-taking behavior within a dual banking system. Design/methodology/approach: This study derives its theoretical foundation from both the token theory and the critical mass theory. Both fixed and random effects are combined to examine the relationship between gender diversity and bank risk-taking in emerging countries. Findings: The results show that female presence on the board of directors reduces banks' financial risk. However, the presence of women continues to positively affect the capital adequacy ratio of large banks. The results also show that the presence of at least two female directors significantly reduces banking risk. The findings support the expectations of the token and critical mass theories. In addition, the presence of female board members, per se, does not influence the risk-taking behavior of Islamic banks. Finally, this study demonstrates that the moderating role of the COVID-19 health crisis is only more effective for large banks than for small ones. The analyses demonstrate good reliability and robustness of the findings of this study. Practical implications: The study provides novel insights for policymakers and practitioners on how female directors impact banks' risk-taking behavior in dual-banking countries. It also contributes to the debate on gender diversity and corporate governance literature, which can help in monitoring bank risk-taking and improving financial stability. Originality/value: This study presents new evidence about the importance of board gender diversity for bank risk-taking in a dual banking system by considering the moderating influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also contributes to the literature on bank risk-taking by applying two measures of gender diversity and a critical mass of women on boards. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigates the firms' CSR disclosure by considering the joint effects of board gender diversity and secrecy culture in an international setting. Building on a sample of 14,185 firm-year observations from 43 countries during 2010-2019, this study shows that while board gender diversity and CSR disclosure are positively associated, countries' secrecy levels negatively affect CSR disclosure. However, we provide evidence that the higher female representation on the board of directors significantly attenuates the restrictive role of secrecy culture on the CSR disclosure level. In other words, the suppressive effect of national secrecy on CSR disclosure weakens firms with higher gender diversity on the board of directors. Our results are robust to several sensitivity checks and endogeneity problems. This study suggests that the reducing effects of national secrecy culture on firms' CSR disclosure level can be attenuated by utilizing internal governance mechanisms such as board gender diversity.

Purpose: Are board ties among competitors harmful to customers? The prevalent assumption on board ties among competitors is that they harm customer benefits. This study examines the mechanism by which board ties with competitors result in an outcome conducive to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 79 savings banks in South Korea, we investigate the extent of banks' board ties with other banks and their engagement in a project financing (PF) consortium from 2014 to 2020. The generalised least square was adopted to test the hypotheses. We also performed several supplemental analyses to further support our results. Findings/results: Savings banks with greater board ties with rivals provided more financial opportunities to their customers by forming PF consortia more actively with other banks. Furthermore, the positive impact of board ties on banks' participation in a PF consortium increases, especially when the proportion of external shareholders is smaller or when savings banks are family firms. Practical implications: Outside directors can not only play the role of monitoring the management but also serve as assistants who can help banks provide financial services (or products) that banks could not provide individually. Originality/value: While prior studies have clearly recognised the negative impacts on customers of board-friendship ties among rivals, little attention has been paid to the potential mechanism by which board ties among competing firms can benefit customers. This study challenges the dominant assumption by demonstrating that savings banks with greater board ties with other banks provide more financial opportunities to their economically weak customers. Contribution: Finally, this study contributes to the family business literature by providing insight into how the unique characteristics of family firms in strategic choices make outside directors contribute as assistants than supervisors.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance-firm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets.

Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016-2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: In recent years, the role of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure has become crucial. The aim of this paper is to study how corporate governance affects one part of ESG disclosure: anti-corruption disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined 140 corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports from companies listed on the Italian stock markets and 50 CSR reports from other companies, then this study analysed the adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard no. 205. Findings: The results show a low level of disclosure, and that corporate governance issues matter. In particular, the analysis found a positive relationship between the presence of female and outside members, the number of board members and the level of anti-corruption disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study acknowledges some limitations. Firstly, the research is based on a one-year sample. Secondly, the research hypotheses are confirmed only when considered in relation to a single section of the GRI standards. Thirdly, this study has a bias towards relatively large enterprises. Practical implications: It could be worthwhile introducing a soft regulation regarding the composition of the board of directors that requires a certain quantitative and qualitative composition. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the few studies, the first in Italy, that sheds light on anti-corruption disclosure and its determinants.

This study examines the link between the political connections and financial performance of companies in Brazil and Canada, taking into account the moderating role of their country institutional factors. The authors use a comparative analysis of the largest listed companies in the two countries between 2010 and 2017 inclusive. There were four main results: (a) no significant difference was noted in the number of politically connected firms, although Brazilian companies were more politically connected on average than Canadian companies; a significant difference was noted between Brazil and Canada in terms of the number of politically connected directors and executive officers; (b) a significant and positive link emerged in both countries between political connections and firm performance, as measured by ROIC and ROA; (c) distinguishing between the political connections of directors and those of officers, a more significant positive association with performance was noticed in the latter; (d) most important, a clear and significant moderating role played by their country institutional factors was not apparent in the relationship between firms' political connections and performance. These latter results are mainly due to the lack of significant difference between the two countries in the number of politically connected firms. Contrary to expectations (and those of previous studies examining multicountry samples), the same effects from corporate political connections were shown in both countries. The study makes two important contributions. First, political connections seem to have become stronger than governance and institutional mechanisms, when it comes to controlling the behaviour of big corporations. Political connections have become so important that they influence the firm's management structure, whatever the institutional context; they seem to transcend governance mechanisms. Second, this study is among the first to demonstrate the need for investigating political connections at different firm levels; it shows the specific effect of political connections through executive officers rather than only through boards of directors, as is usually done.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

In this study, I examine the role racial minorities in the boardroom can play in reducing social injustice by promoting more equal access to mortgage credit to minority households. I develop a simple theoretical model that posits directors who are racial minorities provide the credit unions they govern with a perspective that shapes lenders' trust of minority applicants. This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants. (c) The Author(s) 2021.
