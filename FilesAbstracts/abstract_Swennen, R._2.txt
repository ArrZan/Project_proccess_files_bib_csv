The performance of the crop plant and the 'ratoon' plant (lateral shoot succeeding the harvested main shoot) of 65 medium-sized False Horn plantains (Musa cv. AAB) was studied by measuring vegetative and inflorescence (bunch) parameters. From significant regressions between different parameters it appears that taller pseudostems produce leaves at a faster rate, flower earlier and produce heavier infructescences which need more time to mature. A high yield is determined by vigorous initial growth of the planted sucker (lateral root). Before flowering, there is no sink competition between ratoon and main pseudostem growth, and fast-growing main pseudostems are accompanied by fast-growing ratoons. After flowering, competition occurs between the fructifying inflorescence, a preferential sink and the ratoon. The results indicate that plantain should not be considered as an annual crop. © 1985 Annals of Botany Company.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. © 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

The distribution of roots in banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth using intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from flowering plants. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant (P= 0.0001) effect of soil depth, and also a significant (P= 0.0006) interaction between soil depth and horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depths. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of the soil (40.1%). Above 65.1% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of the soil. More than 79.4% and 88.1% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively.

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr. grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F. macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil), Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil), and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per 100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as much for plantain production.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by β-elimination of α-1 → 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 ≤ 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers. © 2004 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to evaluate yield performance of micro-propagated (MPd) East African cooking banana (Musa AAA East Africa) cv. Uganda and cv. Bukoba in the Eastern zone of Tanzania. Plant size of MPd cv. Bukoba was significantly bigger (p<0.05) with pseudostem height, girth and height to girth ratio of 425.4, 67.0 cm and 6.4 compared to 370.6, 59.5 cm and 6.1 of the conventionally propagated (CPd) banana, respectively. Moreover, plant crops of MPd cv. Uganda and Bukoba were harvested 29 and 27 days earlier compared to the plant crops of CPd banana, respectively. On the other hand, plant crop of MPd cv. Bukoba produced smaller (p<0.05) bunches and fruits weighing 14.4 kg and 138.5 g compared to 23.9 kg and 146.2 g of the plant crop of CPd banana, respectively. Similarly, ratoon crops of MPd cv. Bukoba produced lower bunch and fruit weight than those of CPd banana. The low bunch yield of the MPd cv. Bukoba could be due to reduction in fruit weight. Plant crop of MPd cv. Uganda produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight, length and girth whereas that of MPd cv. Bukoba produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight and girth. Fruit size uniformity was insignificantly different in subsequent ratoon crops of both cultivars. Further studies are required to determine causes and bases of lower yield in MPd cv.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

A genome-wide tagging strategy was followed for the isolation and characterization of novel banana promoters. Embryogenic cell suspensions were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a promoterless, codonoptimized luciferase (Iuc+) gene next to the right T-DNA border. Around 16,000 transgenic cell colonies were screened two months after transformation at room temperature for baseline luciferase activity and positive colonies were removed. The remaining cell cultures were re-screened in real-time at 26°C followed by a gradual decrease to 8°C. The baseline activation frequency was 0.98%, while the frequency of lowtemperature luciferase activity was 0.61% in the same population of cell cultures. Transgenic colonies responsive to low temperature were regenerated to plantlets with the expression pattern monitored during different regeneration stages. Enhanced, repressed or stable expression patterns were observed and high luciferase activity was restricted to specific organs including the root, meristematic region and pseudostem. DNA gel blot analyses revealed the presence of multiple T-DNA inserts averaging 3.2 (range 1 to 5) in five independent lines tested. Banana DNA sequences flanking the right and left T-DNA border were cloned via TAIL-PCR and inverse PCR. However, some lines contained in the T-DNA flanks vector backbone parts, tandem repeats and sequences derived from the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter with part of the selectable marker gene neo from the tagging construct. RT-PCR analysis was performed to identify and confirm in lines with multiple inserts the sequence that activated luciferase expression. Confirmed sequences are currently fused to the uidA reporter gene and back-transformed to cell suspensions in order to confirm their promoter activity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

The use of banana plants in the historical iron production industries of several pre-colonial kingdoms of southern and western Uganda has been documented by the presence of banana pseudostem impressions preserved in slag, a waste product of smelting. An investigation into the selection and use of plants within these technologies was undertaken in 2003 in southern Uganda, implementing a new methodology to record the archaeobotanical in formation contained within the slag. Non-destructive casts of plant impressions were made on-site using a polyvinyl-siloxane dental gel. These were then taken to London for further examination, and the casts were identifed to the level of plant family, enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis. More recently, archaeometallurgical research in western Uganda in 2007 also revealed the repeated presence of these banana pseudostem impressions in iron smelting slag, confrming that this was an unusual, yet international aspect of these localized iron production techologies.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. © 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' × 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

This study aimed to determine the effect of silicon (Si) in reducing the symptoms of Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), on banana plants. Banana seedlings of Grand Nain (resistant) and Maçã (susceptible) were grown in plastic trays amended with 0 (-Si) or 0.39 g Si (+Si) per kg of soil and inoculated with Foc at 60 days after transplanting. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem significantly increased by 30.26 and 58.82%, respectively, for the +Si treatment compared with -Si treatment. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem of Grand Nain plants was, respectively, 11.57 and 37.04% greater than that found in Maçã. The +Si plants showed a reduction of 12.37, 49.81, 51.87 and 20.39%, respectively, for the area under reflex leaf symptoms progress curve, the area under root symptoms progress curve, the area under disease progress curve and the area under asymptomatic fungal colonization of tissue progress curve compared with -Si plants. The area under darkening of rhizome-pseudostem progress curve (AUDRPPC) of Maçã significantly increased by 15.98% for the -Si treatment in comparison with the +Si treatment. For the +Si treatment, the AUDRPPC of the plants from the Maçã cultivar significantly decreased by 20.59% in comparison with the plants from the Grand Nain cultivar. The area under relative lesion length progress curve (AURLLPC) of the plants from the Maçã cultivar significantly decreased by 41.54% for the +Si treatment in comparison with the -Si treatment. There was no significant difference between the -Si and +Si treatments in the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC of Grand Nain. For the +Si treatment, the AURLLPC of Grand Nain significantly decreased by 9.23% in comparison with Maçã. There was no significant difference between the Grand Nain and Maçã for the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC in the -Si treatment. The findings of this study show that supplying Si to banana plants, especially to a susceptible cultivar to Foc, had a great potential in reducing the intensity of Fusarium wilt and may play a key role in disease management when banana plants are cultivated in Si-deficient soils infested by this pathogen. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam™) and NFB (Bio-N™) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8±1.02 × 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5±0.80 × 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5± 0.50 × 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Urabá region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

Micropropagated banana plantlets represent a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens but also of beneficial root inhabitants (e.g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. Mycorrhization of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only a few studies have reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report for the first time the effects of in vitro mycorrhization of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat–sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66.7 and 34.6% greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64.7 and 40%, respectively). In vitro mycorrhization under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions. © 2015, The Society for In Vitro Biology.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005–2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Ensete ventricosum is a traditional multipurpose crop mainly used as a staple/co-staple food for over 20 million people in Ethiopia. Despite this, scientific information about the crop is scarce. Three types of food, viz., Kocho (fermented product from scraped pseudostem and grated corm), Bulla (dehydrated juice), and Amicho (boiled corm) can be prepared from enset. These products are particularly rich in carbohydrates, minerals, fibres, and phenolics, but poor in proteins. Such meals are usually served with meat and cheese to supplement proteins. As a food crop, it has useful attributes such as foods can be stored for long time, grows in wide range of environments, produces high yield per unit area, and tolerates drought. It has an irreplaceable role as a feed for animals. Enset starch is found to have higher or comparable quality to potato and maize starch and widely used as a tablet binder and disintegrant and also in pharmaceutical gelling, drug loading, and release processes. Moreover, enset shows high genetic diversity within a population which in turn renders resilience and food security against the ever-changing environmental factors and land use dynamics. Therefore, more research attention and funding should be given to magnify and make wider use of the crop. © 2020 Getahun Yemata.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop. © 2020, Prof. H.S.

This investigation was carried out during the two successive seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the private orchard of the modern agriculture company (PICO), El Behera governorate, Egypt, to study the effect of Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria (NFB) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) and different rates of N and P as mineral fertilizers (i.e. 50% and 75% of recommended dose), compared to the standard recommended mineral fertilization on the growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral contents of Williams banana plants. Results showed that T8 (50% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) and T7 (100% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) enhanced plant growth i.e. pseudostem length and perimeter also, it increased bunch weight and yield and improved most physical parameters (i.e. finger no./hand, finger length, finger weight, pulp weight, pulp weight and pulp ratio) and chemical characters (T.S.S, total sugar % and reducing sugar %), leaf mineral content (N, P, and K) and chlorophyll a and b were also significantly affected by treatments compared to the control during two season of study. The results suggest that, the utilized biofertilizers can partially substitute the amount of mineral fertilizers, leading to cleaner environment. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars. © 2021 Indonesian Journal of Agricultural Science.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at α = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. © 2022 by authors.

In the banana crop, leaf area is a fundamental trait for produc-tion; however, monitoring this variable during a cycle is difficult due to the structural characteristics of the plant, and a method for its determination is necessary. Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a model for estimating total leaf area by measuring the cross-sectional area of the pseudostem to identify when meristematic differentiation occurs. In plants between F10 and f lowering, functional leaves were measured for length, width, and dry mass. Cross-sectional area was calculated every 10 cm from the base to 70 cm, at ⅓, ½ of the plant height and up to the last pair of leaves. From the principal compo-nents, the cross-sectional measurement at 50 cm was selected, obtaining a nonlinear model for indirect estimation of leaf area. Subsequently, Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis was used with the parameters associated with the number of leaves emitted and the estimated leaf area to obtain the cutoff point as the centroid of the extracted components. As an indicator for the approximate identification of the moment of meristem differentiation, the emission of leaf 12 was generated, which determines the phenological stage (vegetative-reproductive) of the plant. The results describe tools to follow up the growth in the productive units to facilitate crop monitoring, allowing the generation of differential production approaches. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

The performance of the crop plant and the 'ratoon' plant (lateral shoot succeeding the harvested main shoot) of 65 medium-sized False Horn plantains (Musa cv. AAB) was studied by measuring vegetative and inflorescence (bunch) parameters. From significant regressions between different parameters it appears that taller pseudostems produce leaves at a faster rate, flower earlier and produce heavier infructescences which need more time to mature. A high yield is determined by vigorous initial growth of the planted sucker (lateral root). Before flowering, there is no sink competition between ratoon and main pseudostem growth, and fast-growing main pseudostems are accompanied by fast-growing ratoons. After flowering, competition occurs between the fructifying inflorescence, a preferential sink and the ratoon. The results indicate that plantain should not be considered as an annual crop.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. (c) 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr. grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F. macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil), Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil), and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per 100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as much for plantain production.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by b-elimination of a-1 - 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 <= 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to evaluate yield performance of micro-propagated (MPd) East African cooking banana (Musa AAA East Africa) cv. Uganda and cv. Bukoba in the Eastern zone of Tanzania. Plant size of MPd cv. Bukoba was significantly bigger (p<0.05) with pseudostem height, girth and height to girth ratio of 425.4, 67.0 cm and 6.4 compared to 370.6, 59.5 cm and 6.1 of the conventionally propagated (CPd) banana, respectively. Moreover, plant crops of MPd cv. Uganda and Bukoba were harvested 29 and 27 days earlier compared to the plant crops of CPd banana, respectively. On the other hand, plant crop of MPd cv. Bukoba produced smaller (p<0.05) bunches and fruits weighing 14.4 kg and 138.5 g compared to 23.9 kg and 146.2 g of the plant crop of CPd banana, respectively. Similarly, ratoon crops of MPd cv. Bukoba produced lower bunch and fruit weight than those of CPd banana. The low bunch yield of the MPd cv. Bukoba could be due to reduction in fruit weight. Plant crop of MPd cv. Uganda produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight, length and girth whereas that of MPd cv. Bukoba produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight and girth. Fruit size uniformity was insignificantly different in subsequent ratoon crops of both cultivars. Further studies are required to determine causes and bases of lower yield in MPd cv. Bukoba.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

A genome-wide tagging strategy was followed for the isolation and characterization of novel banana promoters. Embryogenic cell suspensions were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a promoterless, codonoptimized luciferase (Iuc+) gene next to the right T-DNA border. Around 16,000 transgenic cell colonies were screened two months after transformation at room temperature for baseline luciferase activity and positive colonies were removed. The remaining cell cultures were re-screened in real-time at 26degC followed by a gradual decrease to 8degC. The baseline activation frequency was 0.98%, while the frequency of lowtemperature luciferase activity was 0.61% in the same population of cell cultures. Transgenic colonies responsive to low temperature were regenerated to plantlets with the expression pattern monitored during different regeneration stages. Enhanced, repressed or stable expression patterns were observed and high luciferase activity was restricted to specific organs including the root, meristematic region and pseudostem. DNA gel blot analyses revealed the presence of multiple T-DNA inserts averaging 3.2 (range 1 to 5) in five independent lines tested. Banana DNA sequences flanking the right and left T-DNA border were cloned via TAIL-PCR and inverse PCR. However, some lines contained in the T-DNA flanks vector backbone parts, tandem repeats and sequences derived from the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter with part of the selectable marker gene neo from the tagging construct. RT-PCR analysis was performed to identify and confirm in lines with multiple inserts the sequence that activated luciferase expression. Confirmed sequences are currently fused to the uidA reporter gene and back-transformed to cell suspensions in order to confirm their promoter activity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Ana (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abaca) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

The use of banana plants in the historical iron production industries of several pre-colonial kingdoms of southern and western Uganda has been documented by the presence of banana pseudostem impressions preserved in slag, a waste product of smelting. An investigation into the selection and use of plants within these technologies was undertaken in 2003 in southern Uganda, implementing a new methodology to record the archaeobotanical in formation contained within the slag. Non-destructive casts of plant impressions were made on-site using a polyvinyl-siloxane dental gel. These were then taken to London for further examination, and the casts were identifed to the level of plant family, enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis. More recently, archaeometallurgical research in western Uganda in 2007 also revealed the repeated presence of these banana pseudostem impressions in iron smelting slag, confrming that this was an unusual, yet international aspect of these localized iron production techologies.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. (c) 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' x 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

This study aimed to determine the effect of silicon (Si) in reducing the symptoms of Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), on banana plants. Banana seedlings of Grand Nain (resistant) and Maca (susceptible) were grown in plastic trays amended with 0 (-Si) or 0.39 g Si (+Si) per kg of soil and inoculated with Foc at 60 days after transplanting. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem significantly increased by 30.26 and 58.82%, respectively, for the +Si treatment compared with -Si treatment. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem of Grand Nain plants was, respectively, 11.57 and 37.04% greater than that found in Maca. The +Si plants showed a reduction of 12.37, 49.81, 51.87 and 20.39%, respectively, for the area under reflex leaf symptoms progress curve, the area under root symptoms progress curve, the area under disease progress curve and the area under asymptomatic fungal colonization of tissue progress curve compared with -Si plants. The area under darkening of rhizome-pseudostem progress curve (AUDRPPC) of Maca significantly increased by 15.98% for the -Si treatment in comparison with the +Si treatment. For the +Si treatment, the AUDRPPC of the plants from the Maca cultivar significantly decreased by 20.59% in comparison with the plants from the Grand Nain cultivar. The area under relative lesion length progress curve (AURLLPC) of the plants from the Maca cultivar significantly decreased by 41.54% for the +Si treatment in comparison with the -Si treatment. There was no significant difference between the -Si and +Si treatments in the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC of Grand Nain. For the +Si treatment, the AURLLPC of Grand Nain significantly decreased by 9.23% in comparison with Maca. There was no significant difference between the Grand Nain and Maca for the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC in the -Si treatment. The findings of this study show that supplying Si to banana plants, especially to a susceptible cultivar to Foc, had a great potential in reducing the intensity of Fusarium wilt and may play a key role in disease management when banana plants are cultivated in Si-deficient soils infested by this pathogen.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28+-2.01, 41.56+-2.55); phytates (3.78+-0.05, 3.23+-0.33); tannins (7.99+-0.26, 6.55+-0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47+-0.14, 1.44+-0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam(tm)) and NFB (Bio-N(tm)) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8+-1.02 x 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5+-0.80 x 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5+- 0.50 x 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Uraba region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

Micropropagated banana plantlets represent a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens but also of beneficial root inhabitants (e.g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. Mycorrhization of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only a few studies have reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report for the first time the effects of in vitro mycorrhization of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat-sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66.7 and 34.6% greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64.7 and 40%, respectively). In vitro mycorrhization under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain 'HD-1' with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds' classification, the pseudostem of banana strain 'HD-1' is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3x, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, 'HD-1' is classified as '1B' type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that 'HD-1' exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are 'susceptible' and 'high sensitivity' respectively. We conclude that 'HD-1' has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. (c) 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods.

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005-2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations.

Ensete ventricosum is a traditional multipurpose crop mainly used as a staple/co-staple food for over 20 million people in Ethiopia. Despite this, scientific information about the crop is scarce. Three types of food, viz., Kocho (fermented product from scraped pseudostem and grated corm), Bulla (dehydrated juice), and Amicho (boiled corm) can be prepared from enset. These products are particularly rich in carbohydrates, minerals, fibres, and phenolics, but poor in proteins. Such meals are usually served with meat and cheese to supplement proteins. As a food crop, it has useful attributes such as foods can be stored for long time, grows in wide range of environments, produces high yield per unit area, and tolerates drought. It has an irreplaceable role as a feed for animals. Enset starch is found to have higher or comparable quality to potato and maize starch and widely used as a tablet binder and disintegrant and also in pharmaceutical gelling, drug loading, and release processes. Moreover, enset shows high genetic diversity within a population which in turn renders resilience and food security against the ever-changing environmental factors and land use dynamics. Therefore, more research attention and funding should be given to magnify and make wider use of the crop. (c) 2020 Getahun Yemata.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop.

This investigation was carried out during the two successive seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the private orchard of the modern agriculture company (PICO), El Behera governorate, Egypt, to study the effect of Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria (NFB) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) and different rates of N and P as mineral fertilizers (i.e. 50% and 75% of recommended dose), compared to the standard recommended mineral fertilization on the growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral contents of Williams banana plants. Results showed that T8 (50% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) and T7 (100% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) enhanced plant growth i.e. pseudostem length and perimeter also, it increased bunch weight and yield and improved most physical parameters (i.e. finger no./hand, finger length, finger weight, pulp weight, pulp weight and pulp ratio) and chemical characters (T.S.S, total sugar % and reducing sugar %), leaf mineral content (N, P, and K) and chlorophyll a and b were also significantly affected by treatments compared to the control during two season of study. The results suggest that, the utilized biofertilizers can partially substitute the amount of mineral fertilizers, leading to cleaner environment. (c) 2020, ALOKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at a = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. (c) 2022 by authors.

In the banana crop, leaf area is a fundamental trait for produc-tion; however, monitoring this variable during a cycle is difficult due to the structural characteristics of the plant, and a method for its determination is necessary. Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a model for estimating total leaf area by measuring the cross-sectional area of the pseudostem to identify when meristematic differentiation occurs. In plants between F10 and f lowering, functional leaves were measured for length, width, and dry mass. Cross-sectional area was calculated every 10 cm from the base to 70 cm, at  1/3 ,  1/2 of the plant height and up to the last pair of leaves. From the principal compo-nents, the cross-sectional measurement at 50 cm was selected, obtaining a nonlinear model for indirect estimation of leaf area. Subsequently, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was used with the parameters associated with the number of leaves emitted and the estimated leaf area to obtain the cutoff point as the centroid of the extracted components. As an indicator for the approximate identification of the moment of meristem differentiation, the emission of leaf 12 was generated, which determines the phenological stage (vegetative-reproductive) of the plant. The results describe tools to follow up the growth in the productive units to facilitate crop monitoring, allowing the generation of differential production approaches.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5-100% accuracy levels.

The performance of the crop plant and the 'ratoon' plant (lateral shoot succeeding the harvested main shoot) of 65 medium-sized False Horn plantains (Musa cv. AAB) was studied by measuring vegetative and inflorescence (bunch) parameters. From significant regressions between different parameters it appears that taller pseudostems produce leaves at a faster rate, flower earlier and produce heavier infructescences which need more time to mature. A high yield is determined by vigorous initial growth of the planted sucker (lateral root). Before flowering, there is no sink competition between ratoon and main pseudostem growth, and fast-growing main pseudostems are accompanied by fast-growing ratoons. After flowering, competition occurs between the fructifying inflorescence, a preferential sink and the ratoon. The results indicate that plantain should not be considered as an annual crop.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. (c) 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr. grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F. macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil), Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil), and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per 100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as much for plantain production.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by b-elimination of a-1 - 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 <= 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to evaluate yield performance of micro-propagated (MPd) East African cooking banana (Musa AAA East Africa) cv. Uganda and cv. Bukoba in the Eastern zone of Tanzania. Plant size of MPd cv. Bukoba was significantly bigger (p<0.05) with pseudostem height, girth and height to girth ratio of 425.4, 67.0 cm and 6.4 compared to 370.6, 59.5 cm and 6.1 of the conventionally propagated (CPd) banana, respectively. Moreover, plant crops of MPd cv. Uganda and Bukoba were harvested 29 and 27 days earlier compared to the plant crops of CPd banana, respectively. On the other hand, plant crop of MPd cv. Bukoba produced smaller (p<0.05) bunches and fruits weighing 14.4 kg and 138.5 g compared to 23.9 kg and 146.2 g of the plant crop of CPd banana, respectively. Similarly, ratoon crops of MPd cv. Bukoba produced lower bunch and fruit weight than those of CPd banana. The low bunch yield of the MPd cv. Bukoba could be due to reduction in fruit weight. Plant crop of MPd cv. Uganda produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight, length and girth whereas that of MPd cv. Bukoba produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight and girth. Fruit size uniformity was insignificantly different in subsequent ratoon crops of both cultivars. Further studies are required to determine causes and bases of lower yield in MPd cv. Bukoba.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. (c) 2007 Cambridge University Press.

A genome-wide tagging strategy was followed for the isolation and characterization of novel banana promoters. Embryogenic cell suspensions were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a promoterless, codonoptimized luciferase (Iuc+) gene next to the right T-DNA border. Around 16,000 transgenic cell colonies were screened two months after transformation at room temperature for baseline luciferase activity and positive colonies were removed. The remaining cell cultures were re-screened in real-time at 26degC followed by a gradual decrease to 8degC. The baseline activation frequency was 0.98%, while the frequency of lowtemperature luciferase activity was 0.61% in the same population of cell cultures. Transgenic colonies responsive to low temperature were regenerated to plantlets with the expression pattern monitored during different regeneration stages. Enhanced, repressed or stable expression patterns were observed and high luciferase activity was restricted to specific organs including the root, meristematic region and pseudostem. DNA gel blot analyses revealed the presence of multiple T-DNA inserts averaging 3.2 (range 1 to 5) in five independent lines tested. Banana DNA sequences flanking the right and left T-DNA border were cloned via TAIL-PCR and inverse PCR. However, some lines contained in the T-DNA flanks vector backbone parts, tandem repeats and sequences derived from the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter with part of the selectable marker gene neo from the tagging construct. RT-PCR analysis was performed to identify and confirm in lines with multiple inserts the sequence that activated luciferase expression. Confirmed sequences are currently fused to the uidA reporter gene and back-transformed to cell suspensions in order to confirm their promoter activity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Ana (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abaca) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Psm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. (c) Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

The use of banana plants in the historical iron production industries of several pre-colonial kingdoms of southern and western Uganda has been documented by the presence of banana pseudostem impressions preserved in slag, a waste product of smelting. An investigation into the selection and use of plants within these technologies was undertaken in 2003 in southern Uganda, implementing a new methodology to record the archaeobotanical in formation contained within the slag. Non-destructive casts of plant impressions were made on-site using a polyvinyl-siloxane dental gel. These were then taken to London for further examination, and the casts were identifed to the level of plant family, enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis. More recently, archaeometallurgical research in western Uganda in 2007 also revealed the repeated presence of these banana pseudostem impressions in iron smelting slag, confrming that this was an unusual, yet international aspect of these localized iron production techologies.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. (c) 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) x 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' x 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

This study aimed to determine the effect of silicon (Si) in reducing the symptoms of Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), on banana plants. Banana seedlings of Grand Nain (resistant) and Maca (susceptible) were grown in plastic trays amended with 0 (-Si) or 0.39 g Si (+Si) per kg of soil and inoculated with Foc at 60 days after transplanting. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem significantly increased by 30.26 and 58.82%, respectively, for the +Si treatment compared with -Si treatment. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem of Grand Nain plants was, respectively, 11.57 and 37.04% greater than that found in Maca. The +Si plants showed a reduction of 12.37, 49.81, 51.87 and 20.39%, respectively, for the area under reflex leaf symptoms progress curve, the area under root symptoms progress curve, the area under disease progress curve and the area under asymptomatic fungal colonization of tissue progress curve compared with -Si plants. The area under darkening of rhizome-pseudostem progress curve (AUDRPPC) of Maca significantly increased by 15.98% for the -Si treatment in comparison with the +Si treatment. For the +Si treatment, the AUDRPPC of the plants from the Maca cultivar significantly decreased by 20.59% in comparison with the plants from the Grand Nain cultivar. The area under relative lesion length progress curve (AURLLPC) of the plants from the Maca cultivar significantly decreased by 41.54% for the +Si treatment in comparison with the -Si treatment. There was no significant difference between the -Si and +Si treatments in the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC of Grand Nain. For the +Si treatment, the AURLLPC of Grand Nain significantly decreased by 9.23% in comparison with Maca. There was no significant difference between the Grand Nain and Maca for the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC in the -Si treatment. The findings of this study show that supplying Si to banana plants, especially to a susceptible cultivar to Foc, had a great potential in reducing the intensity of Fusarium wilt and may play a key role in disease management when banana plants are cultivated in Si-deficient soils infested by this pathogen.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28+-2.01, 41.56+-2.55); phytates (3.78+-0.05, 3.23+-0.33); tannins (7.99+-0.26, 6.55+-0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47+-0.14, 1.44+-0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam(tm)) and NFB (Bio-N(tm)) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8+-1.02 x 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5+-0.80 x 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5+- 0.50 x 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Uraba region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

Micropropagated banana plantlets represent a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens but also of beneficial root inhabitants (e.g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. Mycorrhization of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only a few studies have reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report for the first time the effects of in vitro mycorrhization of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat-sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66.7 and 34.6% greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64.7 and 40%, respectively). In vitro mycorrhization under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group 'Grande Naine'. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain 'HD-1' with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds' classification, the pseudostem of banana strain 'HD-1' is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3x, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, 'HD-1' is classified as '1B' type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that 'HD-1' exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are 'susceptible' and 'high sensitivity' respectively. We conclude that 'HD-1' has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. (c) 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods.

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005-2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations.

Ensete ventricosum is a traditional multipurpose crop mainly used as a staple/co-staple food for over 20 million people in Ethiopia. Despite this, scientific information about the crop is scarce. Three types of food, viz., Kocho (fermented product from scraped pseudostem and grated corm), Bulla (dehydrated juice), and Amicho (boiled corm) can be prepared from enset. These products are particularly rich in carbohydrates, minerals, fibres, and phenolics, but poor in proteins. Such meals are usually served with meat and cheese to supplement proteins. As a food crop, it has useful attributes such as foods can be stored for long time, grows in wide range of environments, produces high yield per unit area, and tolerates drought. It has an irreplaceable role as a feed for animals. Enset starch is found to have higher or comparable quality to potato and maize starch and widely used as a tablet binder and disintegrant and also in pharmaceutical gelling, drug loading, and release processes. Moreover, enset shows high genetic diversity within a population which in turn renders resilience and food security against the ever-changing environmental factors and land use dynamics. Therefore, more research attention and funding should be given to magnify and make wider use of the crop. (c) 2020 Getahun Yemata.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop.

This investigation was carried out during the two successive seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the private orchard of the modern agriculture company (PICO), El Behera governorate, Egypt, to study the effect of Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria (NFB) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) and different rates of N and P as mineral fertilizers (i.e. 50% and 75% of recommended dose), compared to the standard recommended mineral fertilization on the growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral contents of Williams banana plants. Results showed that T8 (50% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) and T7 (100% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) enhanced plant growth i.e. pseudostem length and perimeter also, it increased bunch weight and yield and improved most physical parameters (i.e. finger no./hand, finger length, finger weight, pulp weight, pulp weight and pulp ratio) and chemical characters (T.S.S, total sugar % and reducing sugar %), leaf mineral content (N, P, and K) and chlorophyll a and b were also significantly affected by treatments compared to the control during two season of study. The results suggest that, the utilized biofertilizers can partially substitute the amount of mineral fertilizers, leading to cleaner environment. (c) 2020, ALOKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at a = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. (c) 2022 by authors.

In the banana crop, leaf area is a fundamental trait for produc-tion; however, monitoring this variable during a cycle is difficult due to the structural characteristics of the plant, and a method for its determination is necessary. Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a model for estimating total leaf area by measuring the cross-sectional area of the pseudostem to identify when meristematic differentiation occurs. In plants between F10 and f lowering, functional leaves were measured for length, width, and dry mass. Cross-sectional area was calculated every 10 cm from the base to 70 cm, at  1/3 ,  1/2 of the plant height and up to the last pair of leaves. From the principal compo-nents, the cross-sectional measurement at 50 cm was selected, obtaining a nonlinear model for indirect estimation of leaf area. Subsequently, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was used with the parameters associated with the number of leaves emitted and the estimated leaf area to obtain the cutoff point as the centroid of the extracted components. As an indicator for the approximate identification of the moment of meristem differentiation, the emission of leaf 12 was generated, which determines the phenological stage (vegetative-reproductive) of the plant. The results describe tools to follow up the growth in the productive units to facilitate crop monitoring, allowing the generation of differential production approaches.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5-100% accuracy levels.
