Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Conceptualization and research have addressed the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of top management teams and, independently, the effectiveness of alternative corporate governance structures. Those studies which do concurrently consider directors and management focus largely on the board's monitoring of the CEO. The interdependencies which exist among chief executive officers, top management teams, and boards of directors necessitate an integrative approach which simultaneously considers these groups of strategic leaders. In this paper, we provide a rationale whereby a firm might elect a CEO or board dominance structure as compared to more balanced governance structures. We suggest that the efficacy of such choices may depend on several attendant conditions including the portfolio exposure and globalization of the firm, its ownership patterns (e.g., five percent owners, institutional investors, positions held by other corporations), and resource dependence and information requirements.

Recent research has suggested that effective monitoring may assist firms in preventing an eventual bankruptcy filing. Audit committees, board subgroups responsible for monitoring and evaluating the financial health of the firm, may exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in monitoring firms decline as a function of their composition. Another monitoring body which has become increasingly important in the corporate community is institutional investors. This study investigates the extent to which audit committee composition and institutional investor holdings are related to the incidence and nature (prepackaged plans and length of time spent in reorganization) of firms' bankruptcy filings. Results demonstrate no association between affiliated director representation on audit committees or institutional holdings and the incidence of bankruptcy. These two monitoring groups are, however, associated with the nature of bankruptcy filing. Both audit committee composition and the level of institutional holdings are significantly related to a prepackaged filing and the length of time spent in reorganization during the 5-year period preceding a bankruptcy filing.

As the 21st century approaches, there are many pressures prompting changes in corporate board behavior. The author characterizes the current responses as TQM (more of the same, only better) or reengineering (transformation). To respond adequately to the reality and complexities of a global economy, the author argues that approaches to both corporate governance and boards are in need of reengineering. Directions for board transformation are illustrated with a new framework based on the orientation and constitution of boards. Five new board configurations and the path of evolution are presented.

CEOs who jointly serve as board chairs have been the focus of considerable controversy of late. Powerful organizational constituents including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York City Pension Fund have targeted firms that rely on the joint structure. These shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair. Governance activists have made similar recommendations, most notably in the Cadbury Report, a governance reform document written in the United Kingdom. The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers. Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern. More than 80 percent of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair. They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community. Accordingly, we pose the question: Does board leadership structure matter? Specifically, we focus on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts. Our analysis leads us to conclude while there may, at times, be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions (e.g., financial distress; weak board of directors), to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort.

Tracing backward the career paths of the key executives of Business Week's 1990 listing of the 1000 most valuable publicly held companies, we empirically examined the impact of announced changes in key executive plurality on stockholder returns. We found the more complete the position consolidation, the more negative were the shareholder responses. To attempt to gain further understanding, the additional variables of executive's origin, the size of the board of directors of the firm, the proportion of outsiders on the board, and prior firm performance were examined.

This paper examines stock price reactions to announcements of dual-class recapitalizations as they relate to characteristics of the board of directors. Our results show that certain board characteristics provide insight into directors' incentives. We differentiate characteristics of the board that are associated with management attempts to entrench its position and characteristics that may indicate an attempt to improve performance of the firm in the event of a takeover. We find that high levels of insider and affiliated outsider stock ownership, board tenure, and the presence of staggered board elections affect the stock market's reaction to these plans.

An exploratory analysis of practice utilization in 231 family businesses in Washington State is presented. The authors argue that the extent of practice utilization varies with multiple measures of business development. Several practice areas are highlighted-mission statements, family- and nonfamily-management practices, and succession planning. During early business development, utilization is higher for family-focused practices (family boards of directors, councils, training, and development). Data suggest that business-focused practices (written job descriptions, incentive compensation, and formal employee reviews) are utilized more in businesses at later development.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper, drawing on interviews conducted in 1989 and 1990 with directors nominated by unions to American corporate boards of directors shows that union choices in the establishment of board representation in the 1980s reflected union strategy and structure. Those choices in turn, established conditions that affected the ways in which representation influenced governance. The institutional environment strongly militated against the emergence of interest representation in the boardroom; only an unusual constellation of choices was likely to lead to such pluralist deliberation. The strategic choices of unions were more likely to leave undisturbed the board's traditional function as a vehicle for overseeing shareholders' investment. The effectiveness of the oversight depended further on unions' choices in the establishment of board representation plans, selection of directors, and level of support for directors.

Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.

The primary aim of this paper is to explore the relevance and applicability of leadership research in enhancing our understanding of boards of directors' functioning and effectiveness. Secondly, to discuss methodological issues with respect to board research and indicate potentially fruitful methodological approaches. It is suggested that the leadership research stream focused on traits and competencies is particularly promising for future research on boards, since it has been demonstrated that there are traits that can distinguish leaders from non-leaders or effective leaders from ineffective ones; as well as that certain competencies can distinguish superior performers from average performers in particular jobs. Moreover, it is proposed that a promising way forward in terms of methodology is to focus on gathering in-depth qualitative longitudinal data of actual board behaviours based on observation, and to inform quantitative research by such in-depth data in order to enhance the operationalisation of theoretical variables, as well as identifying the critical variables in the first place.

Most current work on Boards of Directors has been focused on what can be considered best practices for effective governance in terms of roles, composition, process and style. Furthermore, this literature can be divided among very practically oriented managerial work, and more rigorous, theoretically based work. Most of the empirical research in this area has been centered on Anglo-Saxon countries. Some European countries, like Spain, have a very different governance tradition. Given this context, our present work deals with two complementary objectives: 1. To ascertain the current status of governance practices in Spain. 2. To obtain evidence about which of these practices may be associated with effective governance.

Corporate governance practices in Cyprus, despite the shortcomings of the relevant legislation, will continue to evolve to meet changing conditions and increased shareholder awareness but certainly do vary and will persist to vary with those of other nations and cultures. Gradually, it is being accepted that the main corporate objective is enhancing shareholder value, which not only indicates superior competitive performance, but also generally requires awareness to the expectations and aspirations of other stakeholders. Wider transparency and independent supervision of management by boards of directors are the central elements of improved corporate governance but board practices should be subject to unforced adaptation and evolution in an environment of globally understood and accepted minimum standards. There is no single universal model of corporate governance, which could be transplanted nor is there a static final structure which could be easily adopted. The country will have to develop a system of corporate governance which will fit its respective culture and values. Therefore, we can learn a great deal from observing developments in other countries and encourage experimentation and variety.

The focus of this paper is to explore how contrasting ideologies influence the selection process of outside directors in the small family business. Small family businesses donot just represent smallscale economic activity but they are the outcome of entrepreneurial ambition and family involvement. This means that willpower and emotional commitment blend with calculative considerations. As emotional as well as cognitive constructs the family, management and entrepreneurship each represent an ideology: paternalism, managerialism and entrepreneurialism. The proposed ideological framework is positioned against alternative approaches to the study of board selection processes. Two sets of data are presented. A piloting survey of 12 family businesses is used to substantiate the theoretical assumption that entrepreneurial firms avoid having outside directors and managerial firms welcome outside directors, leaving paternalistically-run family businesses ambivalent. Repeated in-depth interviews in two family businesses, one founder-managed and entrepreneurial, the other established and traditional, reveal how the professionalization of the board enforces managerialism, challenging thus far dominating ideologies, entrepreneurialism and paternalism. The outcome of this ideological contest, if properly orchestrated, is an energized and more competitive family business. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper aims at reviewing research and presenting a research agenda on boards of directors in SMEs. While most publications about boards in SMEs focus on the lack of research in the area, this paper presents some of the work that has been conducted. Publications on boards of directors during the 1990s in outlets for SME research are reviewed. Boards of directors in small and medium-sized companies are getting increased attention, but the knowledge about boards in such companies is still fragmented. This paper presents research challenges based on a holistic model of directorates in SMEs that is elaborated from previous research about directorates. The papers selected for this special issue on boards of directors in SMEs are presented in this framework. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study investigates voluntary demand for auditing by family businesses, a sig-nificant but relatively unexplored segment of the economy. The paper considers demand for both internal and external auditing by using survey data to investigate the impact of firm characteristics linked to the cost vs. benefit of engaging an auditor. Variables examined are firm size, debt, and two agency proxies that measure separa-tion of ownership and control, namely, the proportion of nonfamily management in the firm, and the proportion of nonfamily representation on the board of directors. The paper also considers the association between internal and external auditing. Descriptive results on voluntary demand for auditing by 186 family businesses revealed that internal audit was more prevalent than external audit, and outsourcing was a common method for providing internal audit. Results from logistic regression analyses provide support for the hypothesized impact of the two agency proxies and firm debt on demand for external audit, but do not explain the demand for internal audit. For firms that voluntarily engaged an auditor (internal and/or external audit), the negative and significant correlation between internal and external audit suggest that in the family business environment they are more commonly viewed as substitute rather than complementary responses.

Increased attention towards the role of the board makes demands on reforms in the boardroom. In many countries, even small and medium-sized firms are experiencing the challenges of creating well functioning boards. In this paper the authors examine the importance of structures and processes in the boardroom of 302 small and medium-sized industrial firms in Sweden. The contribution of the paper is not only that it tries to explore the relationship between processes in the board and board performance, but also that it pays attention to the working structures that exist to maximize the board's task performance. In this study board task performance is measured as the performance of various control and service roles. There are two main findings. (1) The board members' involvement, and (2) the board's formal structures are important for the board's ability to perform its tasks effectively. The findings empirically support the arguments about the importance of a good and clearly defined working style in the board. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

This article studies which of the directors of the largest corporations in Israel were invited to sit on additional boards of directors between the years 1974 and 1988. The article compares organizational affiliations, and the human and social capital of directors who accumulate directorships with those who do not. The study uses logistic regression to discern which variables increase the likelihood of being invited on to an additional board. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that it is a combination of the structure of the national economy and human and social capital of the directors which determines who will join additional boards.

Managing the succession process by the hiring and firing of key executives is one of the important functions of a board of directors. In this research we study successions of fund managers in the closed-end mutual fund industry. The agency issues inherent in closed-end mutual funds makes them a unique laboratory for such a study. Our results suggest that while the overall abnormal returns of these manager changes are statistically insignificant, that the returns are more positive for funds with large expense ratios and for funds trading at a discount. We also find the abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of inside director stock ownership. Corporate bond funds and international equity funds react more negatively to these announcements than other types of funds. The abnormal returns do not appear to be related to board composition, but board composition does vary across fund type, and may therefore indirectly influence the results.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

IPO underpricing is inherently related to both wealth retention and wealth creation. This paper reviews the relationship between IPO underpricing and wealth, then presents the results of an empirical study of the impact of CEO founder status (i.e. is the CEO also the founder?) on IPO underpricing. Results based on data collected from 368 IPO-stage new ventures suggest that founder management has a positive impact on IPO underpricing, and that the founder management-underpricing relationship is moderated by (a) the IPO market share of the investment banker employed and (b) the proportion of insiders on the IPO firm's board of directors.

Relationships between corporate governance characteristics and financial distress status are examined for a sample of Canadian firms. Results from logit regression analysis of 46 financially distressed and 46 healthy firms lead us to conclude that the board of director's composition explains financial distress, beyond an exclusive reliance on financial indicators. Additionally, supplemental results indicate that outside directors' ownership and directorship affect the likelihood of financial distress. Furthermore, splitting financially distressed firms based on chief executive officer change as a proxy of turnaround strategies provides useful insights on corporate governance characteristics in financial distress.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This study examines the role of the board of directors for IPO pricing irregularities. Theory suggests that initial underpricing may be the result of asymmetric information and the long-run underperformance may be the result of managerial mismanagement of new funds due to agency conflicts. A strong board of directors can potentially reduce both asymmetric information and agency problems. We find that the structure of the board is related to IPO pricing anomalies. Initial returns are directly related to share ownership by insiders and the percentage of independent outsiders, and long-run returns are directly related to share ownership by insiders.

While many aspects of stock and option based compensation for corporate officers remain controversial, we suggest that the growing trend for similar practices in favor of boards of directors will prove to be even more contentious. High-ranking corporate managers do not set their own salaries nor authorize their own stock options. By contrast, boards of directors do, in fact, set their own compensation packages. Other potential conflicts of interest include setting option performance targets, stock buybacks, stock option resets and reloads, consolidations (mergers and acquisitions), and service on multiple boards. As trust is the most valuable commodity in a capitalist society, we suggest that these potential conflicts of interest and related outcomes may ultimately serve to erode any anticipated benefits of director stock compensation.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

Board composition, insider participation on compensation committees, and director compensation practices can potentially cause conflicts of interest between directors and shareholders. If these corporate governance structures result in situations where actions beneficial to directors do not also benefit shareholders, then shareholders may suffer. Corporate ethics programs usually address conflicts of interest that may arise in the firm's activities. Some boards of directors take active roles in their firms' ethics programs by actively overseeing the programs. This paper empirically examines the relationship between ethics programs and potential conflicts of interest and the relationship between board involvement in a firm's ethics program and potential conflicts of interest. Evidence in this paper shows that firms with ethics programs have a lower percentage of inside directors on their compensation committees than do firms without ethics programs. Firms in which boards are actively involved in the programs have more independent boards (higher percentage of independent directors and lower percentage of inside directors) and are more likely to compensate outside directors with equity than are firms in which boards are not actively involved in the programs. Supplemental analyses show that the incidence of potential conflicts of interest is not significantly different between firms without ethics programs and firms in which boards are not actively involved in the programs. Taken together, the evidence in this paper indicates that a board actively involved in an ethics program, and not the simple existence of an ethics program, is related to the incidence of potential conflicts of interest.

This study is among the first to systematically evaluate the role of foreign ownership (volume of ownership and board representation) on self-interested strategizing behavior of organizational managers. Building on agency theory, strategic management and organization theory literatures, it argues that the volume of foreign ownership is unlikely to have any bearing on the extent of unrelated diversification that managers pursue. However, the level of foreign representation on the board of directors is likely to dampen such strategies. Results from the empirical examination set in India provide support for this line of reasoning. Contributions, implications and future extensions are explored. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

The empirical relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, the investment opportunity set (IOS) and corporate governance mechanisms is analyzed for a sample of 415 Canadian firms in 1997. Results indicate that firms with high IOS pay higher levels of total compensation to their CEOs. In addition, CEOs of high IOS derive a larger proportion of their compensation from performance-contingent forms of pay such as bonuses, stock option grants and long-term incentive plans. However, CEOs with weak boards of directors are compensated more than CEOs with powerful boards. Contrary to our expectation, we find that in high IOS firms with weak boards of directors, CEOs seek to have higher proportions of contingent forms of pay in their compensation. An implication of this result is that contingent compensation practices may be a more value-enhancing form of remuneration for CEOs. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

The massive under-representation of women at the highest levels in British companies has been noted in retailing as elsewhere. But it has been difficult to set the current situation in perspective in the absence of longitudinal studies of recruitment patterns. This article examines the gender composition of the boards of directors of Britain's largest retail firms over the last 40 years. The results show that, following a lengthy period in which female retail directors were noticeable largely by their absence, a relatively small but significant breakthrough has recently taken place. The educational backgrounds of the women members of today's retail boards, their length of board service, ages and the positions they hold both inside and outside retailing are also examined and compared with those of their male counterparts.

Although corporate governance has seldom been addressed in engineering management literature, it has an extremely critical role: The protection and creation of shareholder value by means of the appointment, development, and support of strong management. The intent of this research is to suggest some best practices regarding the modus operandi of the board of directors in relation to its interaction with the CEO and ability to obtain reliable and objective information outside of the senior management team. This study is done in light of the major metamorphoses that have taken place in corporations during the last 2 decades - mainly, the advent of shareholder activism. It applies to U.S. corporations that are already in existence or in the process of being formed. This research relies on 54 survey results and six structured interviews with individuals who have had significant experience in the corporate governance of U.S. civil engineering and diversified manufacturing companies.

Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

Appointment as a director of a company board often represents the pinnacle of a management career. Worldwide, it has been noted that very few women are appointed to the boards of directors of companies. Blame for the low numbers of women of company boards can be partly attributed to the widely publicized "glass ceiling". However, the very low representation of women on company boards requires further examination. This article reviews the current state of women's representation on boards of directors and summarizes the reasons as to why women are needed on company boards. Given that more women on boards are desirable, the article then describes how more women could be appointed to boards, and the actions that organizations and women could take to help increase the representation of women. Finally, the characteristics of those women that have succeeded in becoming members of company boards are described from an international perspective. Unfortunately, answers to the vexing question of whether these women have gained board directorships in their own right as extremely competent managers, or whether they are mere token female appointments in a traditional male dominated culture, remains elusive.

The paper provides an attempt to direct the research in the area of venture capitalists and the board of directors in SMEs. Issues about boards in venture capital-backed technology based industrials are explored, and various research designs are used to meet different research questions. Empirical results indicate that venture capital firms purposefully use boards in the portfolio firm, and boards in venture capital-backed firms are more active than boards in other firms. The venture capitalist and the entrepreneur/owner-manager of the portfolio firm may have diverging expectations to board roles. In this setting the board becomes an interesting meeting place for studying the processes and the dynamics between external and internal stakeholders. Future research in this area should integrate board role theories and board process theories. (c) 2002 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

A matched sample methodology was utilized to detect ownership and management differences between first generation and multi-generation independent unquoted family companies in the UK. Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in first generation and multi-generation companies were generally drawn from the family owning the company. Both types of companies also had small management teams. Several statistically significant differences were detected. CEOs served longer apprenticeships in multi-generation rather than first generation companies. Multi-generation rather than first generation companies were more likely to employ managers drawn from the family owning the company. In other respects, multi-generation companies generally appeared to be better managed than first generation companies. Multi-generation companies had larger boards of directors. Moreover, a larger proportion of multi-generation rather than first generation companies employed a non-executive director. Owners of both types of family companies, but particularly the owners of first generation companies may be 'control averse'. Many first generation companies (and some multi-generation companies) associated with a shallower managerial pool had failed to address this potential managerial and strategic weakness by selective use of 'outside' managerial expertise. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

Although scholars have studied outside executive succession for decades, there is still no clear definition of the term "outsider". We focus on a new dimension of outsiderness, the industrial background of executives hired from outside the firm into a CEO position. This paper examines the antecedents of boards' decisions on the industry origin of outside successors as well as the short-term stock market response. We find that firms with more independent boards and with blockholders owning large amounts of stock are more likely to hire industry unrelated successors. However, the board's decision does not strictly follow the rhetoric of stockholder's interests. The stock market reacts more positively to outside CEO succession announcements when the CEO comes from an industry related firm. These findings support our theoretical arguments that the boards of directors may use a logic or rule of appropriateness in deciding the industrial origin of outside successors.

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

Awareness of the need for board and director performance evaluation is growing, but implementation has been both partial and slow. It is unusual for boards to undertake evaluations of their own performance, and more so to evaluate individual directors. Directors often feel that individual director evaluation has several drawbacks including undermining collegiality in the boardroom. There is thus a perceived attractiveness of director self-assessments rather than peer review or outsider assessments. Self-assessment, even though subject to a higher degree of biases than a combination of self-assessment and peer assessment, is less likely to give rise to defensive routines and can provide a psychologically safe environment for a director to evaluate their own knowledge. Bearing in mind the above, we developed a 20-question self-assessment tool, which aims to assist directors in evaluating their understanding of important governance concepts and principles, as well as their legal duties as directors.

Although corporate governance plays a crucial role in shaping the vision, image, and reputation of a corporation, this subject has been largely ignored in the prevailing engineering and technology management literature. In the wake of scandals like Enron and WorldCom, the call for effective corporate governance echoes across the boardrooms of many corporations. It is intent of this paper to close the gap between the myth and the reality of U.S. corporate governance effectiveness in engineering companies and to suggest some improvement strategies regarding the modus operandi and optimum structure of this entity. This study would benefit the board of directors of engineering companies that are already in existence or those that are in the process of being formed. It relies on survey results with individuals who, by virtue of their significant experience in the boardroom of engineering corporations, can offer unique insight and provide valuable data to the topic of corporate governance.

This study examines the relationship between board diversity and firm value for Fortune 1000 firms. Board diversity is defined as the percentage of women, African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics on the board of directors. This research is important because it presents the first empirical evidence examining whether board diversity is associated with improved financial value. After controlling for size, industry, and other corporate governance measures, we find significant positive relationships between the fraction of women or minorities on the board and firm value. We also find that the proportion of women and minorities on boards increases with firm size and board size, but decreases as the number of insiders increases. (c) 2003 Eastern Finance Association.

We examine the role of the board of directors, the audit committee, and the executive committee in preventing earnings management. Supporting an SEC Panel Report's conclusion that audit committee members need financial sophistication, we show that the composition of a board in general and of an audit committee more specifically, is related to the likelihood that a firm will engage in earnings management. Board and audit committee members with corporate or financial backgrounds are associated with firms that have smaller discretionary current accruals. Board and audit committee meeting frequency is also associated with reduced levels of discretionary current accruals. We conclude that board and audit committee activity and their members' financial sophistication may be important factors in constraining the propensity of managers to engage in earnings management.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

We examined the roles of institutional investors, boards of directors, and technological opportunity in relation to international diversification. Our research contributes to both agency and foreign direct investment theories. In data on 197 large U.S. firms, we found significant relationships between institutional ownership and international diversification. International diversification was favored by (1) professional investment funds along with outside board members and (2) pension funds along with inside board members. Also, pension funds' long-term orientation facilitated internationalization in industries with high technological opportunities. The results suggest that different institutional owners have different stakes in firms' international strategies, and the effects of boards of directors and technological opportunity accentuate these differences.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors and their monitoring committees (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the full board and its monitoring committees, and a greater proportion of independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the full board. Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on full board and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that full board independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture. (c) 2003 Wiley. All rights reserved.

This paper explores the performance impact of recent changes in foreign shareholdings and boardroom reforms in Japan. Empirical research on the impact of reform on the Japanese corporate governance system could provide useful lessons for their European counterparts who are themselves facing similar pressures to reform. We found that although participation of outside directors in strategic decision-making was associated with positive stock returns, the increase in the ratio of outside directors, the separation of the board members and executive officers, and the reduction of board size were not related to firm performance.

In France the chairperson of the board is most often the firm's CEO. This position strengthens the insiders' hold on the board of directors. Moreover, a large fraction of outside directors is composed of CEOs of other firms. The reciprocal interlocking of CEOs creates the possibility of mutual interdependence of CEOs. We investigate factors explaining reciprocal interlocking directorates of CEOs in French corporations. Our results indicate that CEOs of larger firms hold more reciprocal CEO interlocks and when CEOs have more outside directorships, CEOs hold more reciprocal relationships. We also find a positive relationship between the number of CEOs reciprocal interlocks and their firms' performance measured by ROA. We find evidence that CEOs hold more reciprocal interlocks when a blockholder is present on the CEO's board.

Board configuration is discussed in the context of the perceived needs of the board as a strategic resource of the organization. This is highlighted in the context of the differing governance, performance and social requirements of organizations pertaining to private sector, state and local government ownership structures. Examined is the view that in bringing particular perspectives resulting from their professional, ethnic or gender backgrounds, directors contribute to board effectiveness. This notion is evaluated in terms of directors' coping devices and their perceptions of their ability to be heard on the board. Initiatives that boards may use to ensure the success of such appointments are highlighted. Consideration is also given to enhancing the dynamics of established but dysfunctional appointments. In concluding, the paper develops criteria for success in making board appointments where the prospective appointee is a minority in terms of professional discipline or other forms of diversity.

We investigate the relationship between institutional shareholdings and the firm's corporate governance by looking at changes in the composition of the board of directors and audit committee while institutional ownership increases over time. Our comparison of 74 firms showing increased institutional ownership with a matched control group of 62 firms finds that increased institutional ownership is positively associated with a higher proportion of outsiders on the board and with audit committee and board members who are less entrenched. These factors are widely regarded as signs of a strengthened system of corporate governance and control, underscoring the important role that institutional ownership may play in the firm's corporate governance structure.

This paper examines two recent trends relative to boards of directors' compensation, and their potential incompatibility. There has been some progress in increasing board diversity, specifically the inclusion of women and minorities on boards. The increasing trend requiring directors to hold/purchase equity as a requirement of board membership may seriously compromise further improvements in diversifying boards. Also, an increasing number of companies compensate directors partially or fully in stock grants and options. These compensation policies may be exclusionary, especially for women and minorities, impacting the quality of boardroom discussions and decisions. This study systematically examines whether corporations requiring director equity are exclusionary toward women and minority directors. Contrary to being exclusionary, companies with director stock requirements and annual stock awards have greater representation by women and minorities on their board. Moreover, larger companies are both more likely to have such policies and have higher proportions of women and minorities on the board.

The control role of the Board of Directors is aimed at monitoring the decisions and actions undertaken by managers in order to protect stockholders' interests. Considerable theoretical and empirical research has analyzed whether directors' behavior is consistent with their fiduciary responsibility, but this research has reported inconsistent findings. This paper offers a comprehensive review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the control role of the board and suggests several guidelines for future research. (c) 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

This paper is an attempt to identify what constitutes a good board of directors, and this is based on a comparison between academic literature, corporate governance rating systems and our field research into board practices. We observed that "traditional" academic research focused on a limited number of quantifiable board characteristics, while practitioners attach greater importance to "soft" elements, which are nearly absent in the literature and in the governance ratings. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of all elements that determine board effectiveness. Furthermore, our results identify three areas of improvement for boards of directors.

Has the diversity of corporate boards of directors improved? Should it? What role does diversity play in reducing corporate wrongdoing? Will diversity result in a more focused board of directors or more board autonomy? Examining the state of Tennessee as a case study, the authors collected data on the board composition of publicly traded corporations and compared those data to an original study conducted in 1995. Data indicate only a modest improvement in board diversity. This article discusses reasons for the scarcity of women on boards and concludes that, to enhance strategic decisions, board membership should reflect the corporation's consumer population. Thus, women are a critical but overlooked resource. Areas for future research are also considered.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.

The influence of corporate governance on firm performance has been discussed for a number of years, but mainly in a United States and European business context. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in large Australian firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance, as measured by return on equity and markct-to-book value ratio. The results showed that outsider ratio and female director ratio were positively associated with firm performance, whereas board size and directors' age had no influence on firm performance.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

The purpose of this article is to investigate how ownership structure, especially family and/or venture-capital involvement, as well as entrepreneurial activities, defined as strategic change and renewal, help explain the involvement of independent members on boards of directors. The CEOs of 2,455 small and medium-sized, private enterprises from practically all industries were contacted in a telephone survey, resulting in an exceptionally high response rate. The findings reveal that family firms are more reluctant to involve independent directors on their boards than non-family firms, that presence of venture capitalists increases the frequency of independent board members and that ownership has an impact on board roles. The results do not support the hypothesised relationship that independent directors enhance entrepreneurial activities. One implication of our study is that the often-argued-for strategic contribution of outsiders to the boards in family firms may be overemphasised. Another implication is that family firms that choose to acquire additional capital should be aware that this could result in a change in the board composition and the loss of control of the business. However, new and external owners' inclusion on the board seems to be negotiable since there are also venture capitalists that do not insist on board representation.

The size, characteristics and structure of boards of directors have been claimed to be an important influence on the performance of large firms, but have been less examined in small firms. For larger firms the role of boards acts more as a substitute for the development of internal staff and management skills, indicating that for large firms directors chiefly support the control role of CEOs. The importance of seeing boards, external consultants and internal management skills as substitutes is demonstrated, and is shown to have a non-linear relation with firm size. However, a key finding of the paper is that there is little evidence of a strong association of board size, board qualifications, or board structure with firm performance, measured by profitability, employment growth or propensity to innovate.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

This explorative research paper illuminates the governance systems in Spanish family businesses, and evaluates the extent to which they pursue good governance practise both in the business and family areas. Empirical evidence is drawn from a database of 112 sizeable Spanish firms, and the results show the absolute dominance of the leading family in the ownership, control and management of sample firms. Approximately half of the members of the board tend to be insiders and more than two-thirds are family members. It emerges that generational firms (with third generation and beyond owner-managers) exhibit greater similarity in their governance structures to first generation firms than second generation ones; this might be due to the so-called "pruning" which is used as a survival mechanism. Overall, it emerges that family firms have a very low degree of board regulation by formal rules and family governance systems are hardly developed. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

There is growing interest in corporate values but where do they come from? What factors determine corporate values? This paper argues that they are determined by corporate governance in a broad sense of the word. Three governance mechanisms are emphasized: ownership structure, board composition and stakeholder influence. In smaller companies founder-owners often play a pivotal role in shaping corporate value systems that influence companies for years to come. In larger companies that separate ownership and control, managers and boards come to play a powerful role. In both cases repeated interaction with customers, employees and other stakeholders shape corporate values by way of corporate reputation and corporate culture.

Greater use of qualitative research methods - including observing boards in real time and interviewing directors - needs to occur to advance the field. Quantitative researchers are, it would seem, measuring variables in respect of "structural independence," rather than board and individual director effectiveness, per se. Once "board effectiveness" and "director effectiveness" variables are able to be measured, together with their interaction, a greater likelihood of distilling a more definitive relationship between corporate governance and corporate financial performance may occur.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

The impact of board composition on overall financial performance is not at all clear. One problem with measuring their relation may be that board of director composition and financial performance are endogenously determined. A second problem may be that due to fixed board terms and periodic financial reporting, the relation may be intertemporal. We develop a theory of intertemporal endogeneity of board composition and financial performance. Using causality tests in panel regressions with three years of data for 130 closed-end mutual funds, we find only minimal evidence of intertemporal endogeneity. The evidence that board composition influences financial performance is not very strong and depends on the definitions of financial performance and board composition as well as the type of statistical model employed. We do find somewhat stronger evidence that prior financial performance impacts board composition, but the relation depends on how we define board composition.

This article investigates the effects of a denationalization of ownership on the activities of corporate boards. A simultaneous change in investors' identity on the Swedish stock exchange and the board activities of large Swedish firms was observed during the late 90s. Drawing on the heritage hypothesis we conjectured that there could be a relationship between increased international ownership and increased board activities on firm level. The results show that board activities in terms of range of activities and engagement in the decision process increased during the 90s. No relationship was found between change in ownership identity and board activities, instead the increase in activities seemed to be a general phenomenon, while ownership change was firm specific. To explain this result a hypothesis of legitimization seeking behaviour and indirect influence of denationalization, specific to the period in question, is formulated.

The research was designed to explore interaction amongst directors seeking to achieve agreement on a key strategic issue in one of their quarterly board meetings.

The board of directors is the cornerstone of any effective corporate governance system. A well- structured board can effectively monitor and motivate management of a company for the benefit of the company's shareholders. This paper investigates the relationship between board structure and firm performance using a sample of 490 publicly listed firms in China. The characteristics of board structure we examined include: board size, inside/outside/independent directors, CEO/Chair duality, stock holdings of directors, rewards to directors and aged directors. We find significant relationship between firm performance and three characteristics: the rewards to director, the stock holdings of directors and the existence of independent directors. We also find political influences on the effectiveness of boards. When state ownership is more than 50% (state-dominating), rewards and stock holdings of directors are useful. When state ownership is less than 50% (non-state-dominating), the existence of independent directors comes into effect. In addition, our analyses indicate that state ownership affects firm performance. State ownership is positively related to firm performance in state-dominating groups while negatively related to firm performance in non-state-ownership groups.

This study empirically examines the association between certain director characteristics and the extent of voluntary audit committee disclosure in annual reports. Results suggest that Singapore's publicly traded firms are more likely to voluntarily disclose audit committee related information as: the number of board members increases different individuals occupy the roles of CEO and board chairperson the proportion of independent directors serving on the board increases. Findings, however, fail to show any association between the amount of voluntary audit committee disclosure and the percentage of executive directors' ownership. Documented findings are of interest and benefit to various parties including regulators, corporate governance reformists, and corporate management. For instance, findings imply that a positive by-product of implementing major corporate governance reforms currently championed by corporate governance reformists will be an increase in audit committee disclosures. As a result, there will be less pressure on regulators to develop, introduce, and enforce mandatory audit committee disclosures that may be potentially intrusive to a firm's management.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

During the decade of the 1990s the number of women serving on corporate boards increased substantially. Over this decade, we show that the likelihood of a firm adding a woman to its board in a given year is negatively affected by the number of woman already on the board. The probability of adding a woman is materially increased when a female director departs the board. Adding a director, therefore, is clearly not gender neutral. Although we find that women tend to serve on better performing firms, we also document insignificant abnormal returns on the announcement of a woman added to the board. Rather than the demand for women directors being performance based, our results suggest corporations responding to either internal or external calls for diversity. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

We analyse the relationship between firm value, as measured by Tobin's q, and newly released indices of effective corporate governance for a sample of 263 Canadian firms. The results indicate that corporate governance does matter in Canada. However, not all elements of measured governance are important, and the effects of governance do differ by ownership category. For the entire sample of firms we find no evidence that a total governance index affects firm performance. This is mainly because we find no evidence that board independence, the most heavily-weighted sub-index, has any positive effect on firm performance. Indeed, for family-owned firms we find that the effect is negative. In general, sub-indices measuring effective compensation, disclosure and shareholder rights practices enhance performance and this is true for most ownership types. We also find no evidence that governance practices are endogenous. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Boards of directors and corporate governance, more generally, continue to capture the attention of practitioners and scholars alike. There are now several reports, such as the Higgs Review, that offer both descriptions of past board structures and practices, and prescriptions for effective corporate governance practices going forward. This paper provides an overview of a series of research in which we have been involved that investigated the relationships between board structures (i.e. board composition, board leadership structure, board size and board member equity ownership) and firm financial performance. The paper demonstrates that not all current corporate governance 'best practices' are supported by empirical investigation. It also offer views on two means for installing independence in corporate boardrooms that hold considerable promise installation of a lead independent director and reliance on an independent board of directors budget. Ultimately, however, no amount of structural prescription will guarantee effective boards of directors. Effective boards will install effective boardroom processes and be guided by individuals with the highest integrity and character. (c) 2005 British Academy of Management.

Recent corporate scandals have focused the attention of a broad set of constituencies on reforming corporate governance. Boards of directors play a leading role in corporate governance and any significant reforms must encompass their role. To date, most reform proposals have targeted the legal, rather than the ethical obligations of directors. Legal reforms without proper attention to ethical obligations will likely prove ineffectual. The ethical role of directors is critical. Directors have overall responsibility for the ethics and compliance programs of the corporation. The tone at the top that they set by example and action is central to the overall ethical environment of their firms. This role is reinforced by their legal responsibilities to provide oversight of the financial performance of the firm. Underlying this analysis is the critical assumption that ethical behavior, especially on the part of corporate leaders, leads to the best long-term interests of the corporation. We describe key components of a framework for a code of ethics for corporate boards and individual directors. The proposed code framework is based on six universal core ethical values: (1) honesty; (2) integrity; (3) loyalty; (4) responsibility; (5) fairness; and (6) citizenship. The paper concludes by suggesting critical issues that need to be dealt with in firm-based codes of ethics for directors. (c) Springer 2005.

This paper examines the effects of board of directors' network characteristics on firm performance using a sample of 199 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1990 through 1999. Two board network characteristics are discussed, namely: board network density and board external social capital. Board network density is defined as the extensiveness or the cohesiveness of contact among the members of board of directors, and board external social capital refers to the degree to which board members have outside contacts in the external environment. The test results suggest that a moderate level of board network density enhances firm value, while too cohesive a board network destroys it. It is also found that board members' elite school networks were positively associated with firm performance. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

The board of directors is generally seen as an important internal governance structure. However, the empirical evidence on the board-performance relationship is not conclusive. On the other hand, a growing literature suggests that different control mechanisms, either internal or external to the firm, can interact with each other and affect performance. One such important factor is product market competition. The objective of the study is to investigate further the board-performance relationship taking into consideration the potential effect of market competition. More precisely, the study analyzes the combined effect of boards of directors' characteristics, and market discipline on firm performance. Overall, the results suggest that, competition has a positive and significant impact on firm profitability and productivity. Moreover, this determinant factor creates the conditions for which the board-performance relationship is supported. In other words, for boards to be effective, firms should be exposed to a competitive environment. (c) Blackwcll Publishing Ltd. 2005.

The challenge for boards is to prevent crises in the organisations they govern. Performance evaluation is a key means by which boards can recognise and correct corporate governance problems and add real value to their organisations. Our paper provides a practical introduction to board and director evaluations. We discuss the reasons for governance failures and how board evaluations can help prevent them from occurring. We then review the performance pressures facing boards and the benefits of board evaluations in meeting these pressures. Finally, we introduce our framework for a successful board and/or individual director evaluation, whatever the company type. In this framework, we suggest there are seven key questions to consider when planning a board evaluation and discuss each of these seven decision areas. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This study aims at investigating the impact of the roles, structure and process of boards on performance of Turkish companies. Drawing on the data obtained from a sample of 386 mostly small and non-listed stock ownership companies, it was found that the separation of chairman and general manager positions has significant positive impact on firm performance. From the board roles of control, service and resource acquisition, firm performance was found to be positively related only to the level of adoption of resource acquisition role. It was also found that the effectiveness, information access and performance evaluation attributes of boards are positively and significantly associated with firm performance.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This study examines the impact that the publication of ratings of boards of directors by the business press has on stockholder wealth. We report findings from an event study of price reactions to the publication of Business Week's 7996 and 1997 ratings of boards of directors of U.S. corporations. As hypothesized, favorable ratings resulted in significant positive abnormal returns after controlling for market effects and confounding events, with only novel information explaining statistical variance. Contrary to expectations, unfavorable ratings also resulted in positive abnormal returns. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Empirical literature on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different studies in the Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration and the board of directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of managerial controls, in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.

There is a swell of opinion in the business media and academic literature that believes that boards of directors are partly to blame for recent failures. This article addresses two key questions: Why do often boards of directors fail to detect warning signals during the early stages of failure; and when they do detect warning signals, why do they tend to remain passive? The article aims to answer these questions through an in depth study of the collapse of HIH. It examines board dynamics over the different stages of failure. It identifies the special challenges that directors confront at each stage of failure and suggests initiatives the board should use to prevent or reverse failure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The Canadian Securities Administrators' National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Policy"),1 released 15 April 2005, on which the author provided detailed advice, reads that: "[t]he board should develop clear position descriptions for the chair and the chair of each board committee" (section 3.5); the board should engage in an explicit two-step "competencies and skills" recruitment of individual directors (sections 3.12 and 3.14);2 and individual directors should be regularly assessed and that these assessments should consider "the applicable position description(s), as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is expected to bring to the board" (section 3.18). The Canadian Securities Administrators, subject to receiving the required approvals, intend for the Policy to come into force in Canadian jurisdictions on 30 June 2005. This article canvasses some of the aspects in assessing board leadership. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

The board of directors plays an important role in solving the agency problem between shareholders and management. This paper investigates the relationships between ownership and board structure with the diversification strategy of large Japanese firms. The results show that corporate nominee directors are associated with lower levels of product diversification of their investee firms. This suggests that nominee directors in large Japanese corporations see themselves representing specific interests and therefore investors should pay attention to board composition in order to assess the level of protection they can expect to receive. Even without any apparent agency problem with management, there remains a potential "principal- principal" problem. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Many financial economists argue that the board of directors' efficacy in the monitoring of managerial behavior depends upon the quality of the directors. Assuming that there is a link between the stock performance of target firms and the quality of their directors, we empirically categorize directors receiving additional directorships following a takeover as "above average" and "below average." We then follow the stock performance of firms hiring new directors for three years after their hiring. We match the two categories of directors with the performance of hiring firms after a director's appointment. Accounting for other contemporaneous effects, we regress the hiring firms' post-performance on director quality and other attributes. The results indicate that directors of "above average" quality are related to hiring firms with "above average" post-performance. (c) 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to test the impact of corporate governance structure on corporate values. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs factor analysis and three-stage least squares to identify and explain variance in corporate values. Findings - In accordance with the proposed theoretical framework ownership, board and stakeholder structure are found to influence corporate values. When value determinants are taken into account there is no significant relationship between values and profitability. Research limitations/implications - This is a pilot study of 71 Danish firms. Further research needs to address measurement of corporate values and to test hypotheses on larger datasets. Practical implications - One practical implication is that corporate values should be grounded in the company's ownership, board and stakeholder structure. Real changes in corporate values may require real changes in governance structure. Originality/value - The paper tests a new approach to the study of corporate values which connects values to governance. It thereby establishes empirical foundations for current discussions about corporate values. This should be important both to practical work on company missions, values and responsibilities and to academics who search for an operational approach to the study of corporate values.

Cannella and Holcomb ((this volume). In: F. Dansereau & F. J. Yammarino (Eds), Research in multi-level issues (Vol. 4). Oxford, UK: Elsevier Science) are unconvinced that top management teams (TMTs) are the appropriate level of analysis for upper echelons research and are, accordingly, unenthusiastic about the promise of multi-level analysis for research of this type. We agree and discuss (1) the fragility of agency theory as it pertains to TMT research, (2) various issues pertaining to TMT turnover (or lack thereof), (3) paradoxes in practice and theory regarding TMT homogeneity/heterogeneity, (4) the absence of boards of directors in the upper echelons perspective, and (5) the implications of these issues on the theory/conceptualization of TMTs and of the research dedicated to them. We question whether the variables, as currently configured, relied on in this literature are sufficiently developed to adequately test an upper echelons perspective, or to sensibly warrant a multi-level analytical approach.

This study explores board compensation and motivation through survey methodology of board members from the Fortune 2000 firms. The data suggest that board compensation and motivation are related to the use of either quantitative or qualitative criteria in the board's evaluation of CEO performance. The interpretation is that boards with equity ownership and high motivation are more likely to use quantitative or verifiable criteria in the evaluation of CEO performance. On the other hand, boards with equity ownership and lower motivation are more likely to use softer or qualitative measures in the evaluation. Implications for corporate governance are discussed.

Existing research on the effects of boards of directors on firm performance has failed to produce consistent empirical results. In the research presented, I argue that this may be due to the fact that such research has largely ignored the interactions that take place on a board and that serve as an enabling mechanism for the board to be able to contribute to firm performance. I introduce the concept of 'board capability', which allows scholars to consider a board's composition, structure and interactions simultaneously. Also, the results of two empirical studies of boards in adolescent companies are presented. Taken together, these studies support the theoretical argument for the importance of board interactions and shed light on the performance effects of boards in adolescent companies.

Our study empirically examines the association between four board of director characteristics and two audit committee dimensions. The audit committee dimensions are the level to which Singapore publicly listed firms voluntarily (1) include more independent directors on their audit committee beyond the mandatory minimum majority of independent directors and (2) improve the collective knowledge and experience of this standing committee by including suitably qualified independent directors. Our analysis is based on hand collected data from 430 domestically incorporated firms listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) at the end of 2003. We find Singapore publicly traded firms are likely to voluntarily include more independent directors on their audit committees beyond the mandated minimum majority when (1) the size of the board of directors increases, (2) firms segregate the positions of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairperson of the board, and (3) the proportion of independent directors serving on the board of directors increases. The percentage of independent directors with directorate interlocks appears not to influence a firm's decision to voluntarily include more independent directors on their audit committees. We also find a statistically significant association between (1) duality (negative) and (2) percentage of independent directors with directorate interlocks (positive) and propensity for Singapore firms to voluntarily increase the collective knowledge and experience of the audit committee's independent directors. Contrary to expectations board size and the proportion of independent directors are not significant determinants.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Governance reform of publicly held corporations is an important topic these days, but a critical subtext has been missing from this often searing debate. Namely, what is the significance of these governance reforms, de jure and de facto, for the publicly held corporation's distant, smaller, but economically robust brethren - namely, the closely held, family-owned business? Should these family-owned entities be held to the same governance guidelines and standards that apply to those firms making up the ranks of the Fortune 500, for example? To put it another way, does one size fit all? We caution that many of the most popularized corporate governance practices may be detrimental to family businesses. Many of these recommendations may harm family unity or might be too complex for private firms, and many are applicable only to very large, public companies with dispersed ownership. Popular corporate governance practices are focused toward a market model of corporate governance, found prevalently in the United States and United Kingdom, which involves companies with a widely dispersed shareholder base and a majority of independent, outside board members. In contrast, the typical family-owned business exhibits characteristics of the control model of corporate governance, found prevalently in continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia, which involves companies with a concentrated shareholder base and family member "insiders" active in management and the board. As a result of these differences, many of the new laws and recommendations may actually be harmful to family-owned businesses. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

This study examines the proposition that the presence of women on a company's board of directors is positively associated with gender diversity in its top management team. Regression analyses indicate that after controlling for firm size and profits, industry type and profits, number of officers, and number of board members, the number of women corporate directors on a Fortune 500 board is positively associated with the number of women officers at the company, the number of women officers holding line jobs, the presence of a critical mass of women officers, the number of women officers with high-ranking or "clout" titles, and the presence of women among the company's top earners. These results indicate the importance of women board members for top management team diversity, and suggest that companies striving for increased gender diversity in their senior officer ranks and more facilitative environments for their top women employees should pay attention to their board-level representation of women.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempts to find a relationship between boards of directors and firm performance. This paper critically examines the premise on which this research is based. An expectations gap approach is applied for the first time to implicit expectations which assume a relationship between firm performance and company boards. An expectations gap has two elements: a reasonableness gap and a performance gap. Seven aspects of boards are identified as leading to a reasonableness gap. Five aspects of boards are identified as leading to a performance gap. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for empirically testing some of the concepts discussed in this paper.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking "strategy consistency" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - To examine an under-researched area, namely the dynamics of chairman-CEO interrelationship and its effect on the enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology has been adopted through in-depth interviews with chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors on the nature of chairman-CEO interactions and their effects. Findings - Four critical themes form the basis of this paper, chairman's role and contribution, nature of chairman-CEO relationship, impact of the chairman-CEO relationship on board effectiveness and the attributes of an effective chairman. Practical implications - Enhances understanding of the determining influence of the chairman-CEO dyad on board and organisational performance and also on the influence of formative context on this dyadic interaction. Originality/value - One of the few studies that has explored through in-depth interviews the chairman-CEO relationship. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board process attributes and company performance of family-owned companies within an emerging country context. Design/methodology/approach - A survey questionnaire was developed and conducted on a sample of privately-held Turkish companies where a total of 386 usable questionnaires were returned. From the original data set a sub-sample of 266 firms with majority family ownership was created. Based on the extant literature, a set of 18 directors' collective attributes and 15 directors' individual attributes were identified as potentially relevant for company performance. Relying on the perceptions of the respondents, multiple subjective measures of company performance were adopted. Findings - Company performance is found to be positively related to the directors' collective and individual attributes which are associated with access to information, effectiveness of board, observance of fiduciary responsibility and performance evaluation. Practical implications - The essential implication of the study for establishing a desirable board climate is the necessity of having a keen focus on information. Sticking to fiduciary responsibility and application of performance evaluations are also indispensable attributes of high performance companies. These attitudes all combined seem to culminate in effective board process. Originality/value - While the subject of corporate governance is gaining an increasing attention from both academic and business circles, there is a dearth of research on board process attributes and their impact on company performance. This paper, therefore, aims to fill this lacuna by examining the relationship between board process attributes and company performance within a big emerging country context.

Prior research has shown evidence of earnings management in financial reports of US and Australian firms changing chief executive officer (CEO). This paper examines whether corporate boards, with certain characteristics associated with strong corporate governance, are effective in controlling any earnings management in the financial reports of Australian firms that change CEOs. Since hiring, monitoring and replacing the CEO are key roles of the board of directors, research in this specific context is considered particularly appropriate. After controlling for contemporaneous and lagged profitability in the year of CEO change, we find evidence of negative unexpected accruals in our subsample of firms where the CEO resigned. For this group, larger boards and a higher proportion of independent directors appear to limit observed negative earnings management. In the case of CEO retirements there is evidence of positive unexpected accruals in the period of CEO change. However, none of the board characteristics show any significant relationship with unexpected accruals. In the period after CEO change, we find no evidence of positive unexpected accruals for CEO resignations and none of the board characteristics show any significant relationship with unexpected accruals. For CEO retirements, our analysis indicates that a higher proportion of executive and affiliated director shareholding goes some way towards counteracting the observed positive unexpected accruals. When lagged unexpected accruals are included in the regression equation to control for accrual reversals, CEO duality significantly increases the already positive earnings management found in CEO retirements in the period following CEO change.

Over the last few years corporate governance codes and shareholder expectations have increased the need for boards of directors to demonstrate effective leadership, quality decision-making processes and the ability to exercise corporate controls. Shareholders and stakeholders continue to focus on indicators such board structure, composition and nonexecutive independence as proxies for effectiveness, often without an increased understanding of the environment in which boards of directors make decisions, or the behaviour and dynamics of individuals. In order specifically to address this issue the Combined Code, published in 2003, stated that a board should undertake annually "a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance, that of the committees and individual directors" (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, p. 10. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance. London: Financial Reporting Council), although it omitted to give formal guidance on evaluation methods, or the disclosure of outcomes to shareholders. This paper draws on earlier research (Long, 2004) in order to contribute to an improved understanding of the role and effectiveness of board evaluation, and to add to the policy debate by identifying board dynamics which influence the environment in which boards operate. It suggests that the evaluation process should interpret specific influences on the environment in which boards make their decisions - company lifecycle, corporate structure, board culture and embedded process - highlighting distinct board roles and responsibilities, and diverse levels of individual approach, expectation and contribution. The author draws on her work through Boardroom Review to explore ways in which board evaluation can achieve a range of corporate objectives which extend beyond compliance, and encourages boards and their chairmen to adopt a thoughtful and thorough approach to this year's evaluation model.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

This study examined relationships between the number of female board members, board tenure, and board size on the number of 10K investigations that were instigated against firms in the basic materials and financial services sectors of the economy. After controlling for the effects of firm size, we found evidence of an interaction effect between the number of female directors and average board tenure for firms in the financial services sector, such that a higher number of women on boards coupled with longer average board tenure results in higher firm social performance (i.e., the fewer the number of 10K investigations brought against the firm). No link was found between female directors and average board tenure for the basic materials firms. Further, no interactive patterns were observed between female directors and board size in either sector. Our findings suggest that future board research may benefit from a "contingency approach, " as this study has provided some evidence that the relationships between board characteristics and firm performance may not be generalizable from one sector to another. Future research should carefully consider how the sector or industry may affect the impact of board characteristics on firm performance.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Past research examining the influence of boards of directors on firm performance has acknowledged, but typically failed to account for, the early life cycle stage of the firm. This study analyzes the effectiveness of board structure and behavior on firm performance in the early stages of the life-cycle for start-up IPO firms. Results suggest that the life-cycle of the firm is an important contextual variable to include when determining board effectiveness.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

Although "board process" has been identified as a critical element for future corporate governance research, gaining access to corporate boardrooms is extremely difficult if not virtually impossible for most researchers. This study attempts to address this important issue in the research methodology used to study boards. Rather than discussing the research results of the particular study however, we focus on those impediments that were faced in gaining access to boards of directors, and how these impediments were overcome. Obtaining such access included the utilisation of several non-traditional routes. The study concludes with implications for future corporate governance research. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose This paper aims to investigate the determinants of good governance in the US firms. Design-methodology-approach The data are taken from a sample of 624 US listed and non-financial firms for the period of 1994-2003. Four indices were constructed that summarize the governance quality: one indice for the board of directors, another one for the board committees, a third one for the audit committee, and a fourth representing an overall or total index. Multiple regressions analyses are used in the study to find the determinants of strong governance. Findings The empirical results show statistically significant and positive associations between each governance index (exception to board index) and firm size, investment opportunities, intangible assets and directors and officers ownership. Furthermore, institutional ownership and external financing needs are positively related to each governance index considered. However, growth opportunities and performance have no significant effect on governance quality. Research limitations-implications Other corporate governance mechanisms could be considered (transparency and disclosure, anti-takeover provisions and shareholder's rights). Originality-value This paper adds evidence to the important debate about corporate governance ratings. It gives a most comprehensive analysis to date in term of sample size and breath coverage. This paper also offers a new contribution to the debate on the determinants of good governance by isolating the effects of firm characteristics on the board of directors from the effect on compensation and nominating committees and from the effect on audit committee.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This paper seeks to argue that boards can be playing a more proactive role in contributing to organizational effectiveness and that their composition requires greater research attention. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, the paper empirically examines the relationship between key board composition variables and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - At this stage in the development of the approach, the focus is on a sub-set of the elements proposed in the group dynamics literature. The population for this study comprises all companies included in the Canadian TSE 300 Composite Index (renamed the S&P/TSX Composite Index). This study uses cross-sectional regression analyses to examine the nature of the relationships between board composition and firm performance. Findings - The data analyses revealed that high levels of experience, appropriate team size, moderate levels of variation in age and team tenure were correlated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Boards of directors (BOD) are teams whose effectiveness can be assessed through group dynamic constructs in the organizational behaviour literature. Further research is needed to examine the intricate dynamics that might moderate or mediate the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. Practical implications - The findings provide a much-needed benchmark to consider whether the composition of boards is optimal, given the functions and mandate. In addition, the study highlights the opportunity costs of boards, restricting their roles to agency issues. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper tests some of the many variables that can be extrapolated from the group dynamics research. The paper calls on boards to examine what BOD functionality really entails, and argues for more proactive behaviours aimed at strategic firm issues. (c) 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Corporate governance issues have attracted a good deal of public interest because of their apparent importance for the economic health of corporations and society in general, especially after the plethora of corporate scams and debacles in recent times. Corporate governance issues flow from the concept of accountability and governance and assume greater significance and magnitude in the case of corporate form of organization where the ownership and management of organizations are distanced. And, it is in this context that the pivotal role played by the board of directors in maintaining an effective organization assumes much importance. A major part of the debate on corporate governance centres around board composition especially board size and independence. Various committees have mandated a minimum number of independent directors and have given guidelines on board composition. However, the relationship of board characteristics such as composition, size, and independence with performance has not yet been established. This paper addresses this question: Does the board size and independence really matter in terms of influencing firm's performance? The findings suggest that: *>There is an inverse association between board size and firm performance. *>Different proportions of board independence have dissimilar impact on firm performance. *> The impact of board independence on firm performance is more when the board independence is between 50 and 60 per cent. *> Smaller boards are more efficient than the larger ones, the board size limit of six suggested as the ideal. *> Independent directors have so far failed to perform their monitoring role effectively and improve the performance of the firm. *> The guidelines on corporate governance should take into account the 'cross-board' phenomenon while defining the criteria for eligibility for appointment as an independent director. *> Lack of training to function as independent directors and ignorance of the procedures, tasks, and responsibilities expected of them could be reasons for the independent directors' non-performance. *> A bad performance leads to an increase in board size, which in turn, hampers performance. Guidelines are provided for future studies to include different variables to see which board composition is suitable for different companies at different stages of life cycle.

Purpose The effect of corporate governance on firm performance has long been of great interest to financiers, economists, behavioural scientists, legal practitioners and business operators. Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design-methodology-approach A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations-implications The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality-value The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Research suggests that a strong and vigilant board can have a significant influence on the value-creating potential of medium-size companies. Yet, how best to conceptualize this relationship remains controversial.The mainstream approach has been to argue for a direct relationship between board demography and company performance. In opposition stands a growing number of scholars who argue that boards' ability to perform board tasks effectively - their actual behaviour - should be taken into account. Empirical studies comparing the two approaches are however surprisingly scarce. Based on this observation, the aim of the study is to test the influence of boards of directors on CEOs' commitment to take an entrepreneurial posture. Both demographic and behavioural board measures are included in the model. Statistical analysis on a sample of 175 medium-size manufacturing companies gives ample support for the behavioural approach. The study ends with a discussion of the results and suggestions for further research. (c) SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n = 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n = 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Board evaluations can contribute to effective boards and improved corporate financial performance. The increasing interest in the practice of board evaluations, however, calls for a more systematic and careful approach than has been employed in the past. While most attention has primarily been focused on the content of board evaluations, this article outlines the features of various possible board evaluation systems. Based on state-of-the-art research on boards and governance, we contend that a comprehensive board evaluation system needs to include decisions about: (a) the agent who evaluates the board; (b) the content, or what the evaluation should deal with; (c) the addressee and other stakeholders for whom the board is evaluated; and (d) how the board is evaluated. These key decisions should not be seen as independent of each other as they have consequences for the kind of system that will be adopted. Following this argument, we present four different board evaluation systems: (i) board-to-board, (ii) board-to-market, (iii) market-to-board and (iv) market-to-market. The key message we communicate in this article is that there must be a fit between the purpose and the system of board evaluations. There is no universal or "one best way" to evaluate boards of directors. Board evaluations will not meet their purpose unless there is a fit between the agents, the addressees, the content and the modalities of the evaluation. It is important to know who is doing what for whom and how. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

Some S&P 500 firms have recently formed technology committees at the board-level. This study investigates the corporate governance and firm financial performance implications of the voluntary formation of technology committees by members of the S&P 500. Using financial performance and structure-related variables, the results of the study suggest that firms' corporate governance ratings are significantly and positively related to their decisions to voluntarily form technology committees. Specifically, firm performance ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, and net profit margin appear to be associated with firms' decisions to form board-level technology committees. These findings have post Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance and performance implications and should be relevant for stakeholders such as the SEC, various stock exchanges, and the firms themselves.

Decisions by boards of directors can have a critical impact on the success or failure of a firm. These decisions range from the hiring and firing of a CEO to market entry and exit to the way in which a firm reports accounting profits and losses. In seeking to understand boards of directors more fully, we have come to think that we need a more complete picture of intraboard relationships among directors, including but not limited to relationships with the CEO, because these relationships affect critical decisions for the firm. The authors propose that the study of boards of directors could benefit by using a conceptual lens that scholars have yet to apply to this setting-that of the board as a social network unto itself.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the independence of audit committees is affected by the degree of control exerted by managers over the board of directors. Results from a sample of 75 listed Spanish companies show that the majority of firms that voluntarily adopted an audit committee between 1998 and 2001, made an effort to guarantee their independence from management. The degree of independence is shown to be determined by the proportion of inside directors on the board, the same person holding both the CEO and board chairperson positions, and the level of management ownership. These findings may have political implications because existing regulations do not limit the presence of inside directors on audit committees. The presence of inside directors may compromise effectiveness, turning audit committees into instruments of management to provide the appearance of monitoring.

Increased engagement by investors with the companies in which they invest has been a major change in Western economies since the 1980s. Shareholder value provides rationale and incentive for investor engagement. The book summarizes the basic principles of shareholder value, and explains the reasons for its growth, especially in the UK and the USA. The authors outline a spectrum of investor engagement ranging from indirect/laissez-faire influence via (threat of) exit to direct intervention in specific areas of management practice. The book focuses on two types of investor, institutional investors and private equity/venture capital investors. Different types of institutional investors have different incentives for engagement, and adopt different methods. 'Universal investors' with long time horizons, such as pension funds, have especially strong incentives for engagement, as illustrated by USS Limited. The book distinguishes between institutional investors' routine and extraordinary engagement, and shows how collaboration amongst investors through organizations such as the Institutional Shareholders' Committee offsets the high costs of monitoring and provides means for ensuring compliance with best City practice'. The engagement of private equity funds is illustrated through case studies of equity funds and the portfolio firms in which they invested. But corporate managers are not simply passive reactors to investors' interventions: managers seek to influence investors, for example through managing market expectations. Shareholder value conceptions are not universal: they are strong in the UK and the USA, but are weaker in coordinated market economies such as Germany. The book concludes by evaluating the normative case for shareholder value and investor engagement, arguing that conventional analyses overestimate the efficiency arguments for shareholder value and the equity arguments against shareholder value. The future development of corporate governance is seen to require greater openness and the inclusion of a wider range of interests, not the further enhancement of the protection accorded to shareholder interests.

Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the gender composition and structure of the board of directors in not-for-profit organisations and their relation to firm-level entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey sent to Swedish riding schools. The paper focuses on not-for-profit associations and the analysis is based on 60 respondents. The data were analysed by multivariate methods. Findings The overall gender composition of boards had no influence on firm-level entrepreneurship. However, a high proportion of women in powerful positions were found to have a positive influence on one of the study's two dimensions of firm-level entrepreneurship, i.e. strategic opportunism. No influence concerning gender in powerful positions was found on risk taking, the other dimension of firm-level entrepreneurship. Originality/value The attention to gender composition not only focuses on the board at large, but also highlights the specific positions of the chairperson, secretary and treasurer in the board structure. Another valuable insight concerns firm-level entrepreneurship, here treated as a two-dimensional concept, consisting of strategic opportunism and risk taking, which finds support in the analysis. Further, the empirical data were collected from an industry that includes a high proportion of women on the boards, i.e. the Swedish riding school industry. The study contributes to the debate concerning the gender composition on the board of directors where a high proportion of women in powerful positions is positively related with strategic opportunism.

Until the mid-1990s, the study of initial public offerings (IPOs) fell mainly under the purview of the finance literature. Within the last 10 years, however, management and entrepreneurship scholars have delved more into this subject area, as well. This article summarizes research examining IPO firms that has appeared in management and entrepreneurship journals, highlighting in particular the influence of individuals (namely executives and boards of directors) on IPO firm outcomes.

This qualitative study explored the learning experiences of twelve national nonprofit membership association CEOs using a phenomenological research design. While the professional context of an organization's chief executive is considered unique from other executive positions, the impact of this context on what and how CEOs learned was unclear. The findings describe association CEO learning as being affected in significant ways by the politically charged context in which the nonprofit association CEO operates with his or her board of directors. Power imbalances with staff and the board make learning through traditional organizational dialogue a less useful learning process for the CEOs. Furthermore, the feelings of isolation and vulnerability that are generated from the nonprofit association CEO context often cause CEOs to use private reflection and dialogue with their spouse as primary learning mechanisms. The study concludes that the association CEO context uniquely and profoundly shapes what, how, and why CEOs learn. Perhaps lacking the financial security of lucrative severance payments, which are often specified in employment contracts of for-profit CEOs, the nonprofit association CEO will often temper his or her actions to avoid personal vulnerability with a politically charged board of directors.

Reports citing excessive CEO compensation continue to make the news with evidence of peer relationships between the CEO and the compensation committee often the center of debate. The compensation committee of the board of directors determines CEO pay and is often comprises CEOs from other companies as well as non-CEOs such as academic, exgovernment, and professional individuals. This study examines the influence of the psychological factor of social comparison over accounting performance measures in a compensation experiment with 176 subjects. The results of this study are consistent with social comparison theory in that CEO director-subjects award greater pay and shield the compensation of the CEO when firm accounting performance is below average. Additionally, we find shielding is mitigated when subjects are informed that the decision of the amount of compensation awarded will be revealed to the public. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a framework for a board self-evaluation based on a model grounded in the governance and team effectiveness literatures. It develops arguments for the creation of board effectiveness committees that are assigned responsibility for evaluating board construction, activities and outputs and the fit of these factors to environmental conditions. It presents the board effectiveness committee as an important element in the governance process. Copyright (c) 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The authors argue that the widespread treatment of human capital development in the frames of the internal context of the organisation is too restrictive. Proceeding from the treatment of corporate governance, the authors set up the hypothesis that human capital development in the organisation starts from the owners (supervisory board, board of directors). The purpose of the article is to show the owner's possible influence on human capital development in the organisation. The authors present one possible scheme of ties in the owners' influence on development of human capital in the organisation (choosing the top manager, drafting of strategy, direct interference with the organisation's staff issues, perception of corporate social responsibility, etc.). The results from the in-depth interviews (undertaken in 2004) with Estonian owners and top managers are used to support the authors' standpoint about the significant role of the owner in the development of human capital.

A growing body of ethics research investigates gender diversity and governance on corporate boards, at individual and firm levels, in single country studies. In this study, we explore the environmental context of female representation on corporate boards of directors, using data from 43 countries. We suggest that women's representation on corporate boards may be shaped by the larger environment, including the social, political and economic structures of individual countries. We use logit regression to conduct our analysis. Our results indicate that countries with higher representation of women on boards are more likely to have women in senior management and more equal ratios of male to female pay. However, we find that countries with a longer tradition of women's political representation are less likely to have high levels of female board representation.

Agency-based studies of boards of directors address factors relevant to board vigilance with respect to the monitoring of senior managers. We argue that relying solely on director vigilance may be limiting because vigilance without relevant experience is unlikely to ensure board effectiveness. Our contention is that boards comprising vigilant directors, as well as directors with appropriate knowledge gained through experience, not only will be better monitors, but also more useful advisors to top managers. The focus of our study is on the effect on acquisition outcomes of the interaction of board vigilance and director experiential learning. Consistent with our expectations, the empirical findings indicate that vigilant boards rich in appropriate experience are associated with superior acquisition outcomes.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Why are some newly appointed CEOs (i.e., those with tenure of three years or less) dismissed while others are not? Drawing upon previous reseach on information asymmetry and adverse selection in CEO selection, I argue that the board of directors may make a poor selection at the time of CEO succession, and as a result, must dismiss the appointee after succession when better information about him/her is obtained. Therefore, the level of information asymmetry at the time of succession increases the likelihood of dismissal. With data on 204 newly appointed CEOs, the results of this study support this argument. After controlling for alternative explanations of CEO dismissal (e.g., firm performance and political factors), the results show that the likelihood of dismissal of newly appointed CEOs is higher in outside successions and/or if the succession follows the dismissal of the preceding CEO. Further, if at the time of succession, the firm's board has a nominating committee that is independent and/or on which outside directors have few external directorships, the likelihood of dismissal is lower. Contributions to the CEO dismissal/succession literature are discussed. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

By examining the level of ownership concentration across firms, we determine how principal-principal conflict, defined as the incongruence of ownership goals among shareholder groups in a corporation, impacts agency costs of Chinese boards of directors. Based on data from Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during 1999-2003, we found that ownership concentration had a U-shaped relationship with board compensation, board size and the presence of independent directors. These results provide corroborating evidence that principal-principal conflict can lead to high agency costs. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The aim of this study is to uncover whether prescribed "western style" governance practices surface in the characteristics of board of directors in Turkish banks, and to see if these characteristics influence firm performance. Turkey is an emerging market drawing large amounts of foreign investment but board composition issues have rarely been analyzed. Research Findings/Results: This study investigates the association of board independence, CEO duality, board size, and board tenure with bank performance in Turkey. These relationships are examined for all 27 Turkish banks operating in the market between the years 2001-2004. Our findings suggest that the presence of insiders has a positive impact on return on assets, while duality and board tenure are negatively associated with performance. Theoretical Implications: Our study shows that Turkish banks are following a number of recommended governance practices, but the prevalence of some arrangements may exacerbate principal-principal conflict. Whether this holds in other more closed sectors of the economy is an area worthy of further investigation. Practical Implications: The presence of duality in the form of duly empowered members/executive directors is very problematic, leading to potential principal-principal conflict. Strategic investors and portfolio managers should challenge this arrangement before making sizable outlays in the Turkish financial sector. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Purpose - The relationship between the board characteristics (i.e. board independence, CEO duality, board size, board meeting and board tenure) and the ownership structure (i.e. managerial ownership, family ownership and institutional ownership) and earnings quality is examined. Design/methodology/ approach - Data from 280 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board for the year 2004 is used. Findings - Significant association was found between board tenure and earnings quality. In addition, a positive significant association was found between outside board ownership and family ownership and earnings quality. However no significant relationship was found between board of directors' independence and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications - The association between audit committees' characteristics and earnings quality was not examined. An examination of the impact of ownership structure on boards of directors and audit committees is warranted. An investigation of the impact of the ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia using separate test on family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms is suggested. Practical implications - The appropriateness of policy directives requiring majority independent directors may be considered by policy makers. Originality/value - The conflict of interest between outside shareholders and managers in a diffused ownership support the agency theory. However, utility of agency theory to explain the conflicts between the controlling owners and the minority shareholders where ownership concentration is prevalent is limited. Whilst demonstrating the dominant impact of ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia the study calls for alternative explanations of corporate governance practices in different institutional settings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the role of audit committees (AC) in the initial public offering (IPO) process in a governance environment where AC best practices are well established but their adoption is voluntary. We consider the creation and characteristics of the committee as signals that issuing firms can use to reduce the underpricing often associated with IPOs. We also examine the effect of the committee on the quality of management earnings forecasts included in the prospectus. Research Findings/Results: Our empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 246 IPOs issued in the Canadian province of Quebec. We find that the creation of an AC at the time of the IPO has no effect on underpricing unless its members are independent and have expertise in financial matters, in which case it decreases significantly the level of underpricing of the IPO. However, we find no significant association between these two governance attributes and the accuracy of forecasts included in prospectuses. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that the AC is a credible signal that could be used in the firm's signaling strategy and the results provide support for the monitoring role of the board of directors, as proposed by the agency theory. Practical/Policy Implications: Our results support the worldwide movement in legislations requiring AC independence and expertise. They stress the importance of the presence of qualified members on the AC with sufficient knowledge of accounting and finance. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate governance practices of small cap companies have had on their financial performances. Previous studies have mainly examined governance practices of larger corporations. This analysis focuses on the governance variables that have been highlighted by the New Zealand Securities Commission (2004) governance principles and guidelines and also on the governance variables that are supported in the literature as providing an appropriate structure for the firm in the environment in which it operates. The data for 71 small cap companies listed in New Zealand over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005 was analysed. Pooled data, OLS and 2SLS regression techniques were used and Tobin's Q, ROA and OPINC were used as the dependent variables. The evidence does support the hypothesis that the existence of board independence and audit committee has enhanced firm financial performance, as measured by Tobin's Q.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the views of directors of public-listed Australian companies regarding the role of the independent director and the significance of that role in relationship to the composition of the board of company directors. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study using a grounded research approach was used and 30 directors of Australian public-listed companies were interviewed. Findings - The analysis indicates that participating directors were convinced that a majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) provided a safeguard for a balance of power in the board/management relationship. The difference between NEDs, who are also independent directors, and NEDs who are not independent, was highlighted as an important distinction. The capacity for board members to think independently was seen to be enhanced, but not necessarily ensured, with majority membership of NEDs. However, a majority of independent minds expressing multiple points of view was perceived to reduce the board room hazard of "group think." Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted within the context of the preferred model for board composition in Australian public-listed companies which requires a majority of NEDs. Originality/value - Conflicting evidence surrounding the claim that a majority of independent members in the board structure contributes to "best pratice governance" makes the paper relevant to governance issues being debated in the global arena.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Environmental problems have become major headlines due to the negative effects they bring to the stability of the ecosystem. Thus, the increased awareness of social responsibility or, specifically, environmental concern is now a challenge facing the corporate world. This study tests whether the independence of Boards of Directors, CEO duality, management ownership and board size have any association with the companies' decision to disclose environmental information in annual reports. The data is based on a content analysis of the annual reports of 243 companies listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia for the year 2005. The findings reveal that only board size has a significant relationship with environmental reporting.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the impact of employee stock ownership and board employee representation on firm performance. Research Findings/Results: Results drawn from a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 230 French firms over the period 2000-2005 provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and accounting-based performance measures. However, this relationship is not supported when a market-based performance measure is used. We also found that the inflection point of the inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and firm performance does not depend upon the level of employee representation on the board. Theoretical Implications: This study addresses the inconsistency of results found so far in the literature examining the performance implications of employee ownership by proposing a theoretical framework and providing empirical support for the hypothesis suggesting that the relationship between employee ownership and firm performance is not linear, but indeed, has an inverted U-shape. Practical Implications: In a governance context characterized by a spectacular increase in employee ownership fostered by a pervasive support from both managers and government, our results suggest that performance implications of employee ownership are positive up to a certain point, after which the marginal effect of employee ownership on firm performance becomes negative. As a result, our findings suggest that managers and shareholders should be careful when launching and increasing the level of employee ownership to not go beyond specific inflection points.

The separation of ownership from control in modern corporations has led to some interesting questions and much debate among researchers and practicing managers (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Berle and Means, 1932; Johnson, Daily, and Ellstrand, 1996; Zahra and Pearce, 1989). Individual shareholders, unless they are also managers or hold a large block of stock, have very little influence on the company. Managers, as agents for the shareholders, make most important decisions with regard to corporate operations. Stewardship theory suggests that managers should be given maximum liberty to make decisions so that they are not encumbered by rules and influences that can jeopardize optimal performance (Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson, 1997) However, many researchers and practitioners wonder whether managers can be relied upon to sacrifice their own self-interests and behave in a manner that is in the best interests of the shareholders.

Director compensation can potentially represent an ethical minefield. When faced with supporting strategic decisions that can lead to an increase in director pay, directors may consider their own interests and not solely those of the shareholders to whom they are legally bound to represent. In such cases, directors essentially become agents, rather than those installed to protect principals (shareholders) from agents. Using acquisitions as a study context, we employ a matched-pair design and find a statistically significant difference in outside director compensation between acquiring and control firms. Outside directors of acquiring firms earn more than twice as much as their counterparts in the matched-sample. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates whether the form of compliance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) appears to be idiosyncratic to a specific company or features similarities across firms. The major aim of this research is thus to explore the ability of a classification of compliance patterns to account for the similarities and differences between firms regarding their conformity with the GCGC. Research Findings/Insights: Based on seven dimensions of code compliance, cluster analysis is used to identify discrete groups of companies with similar patterns of code observance. We determine eight patterns of compliance which are characterized by distinct forms of code conformity. Theoretical Academic Implications: The identified cluster solution does not merely reflect the number of rejected code recommendations. Rather, companies with very similar rates of overall compliance with the GCGC are assigned to different clusters because they feature, at the same time, different patterns of code conformity. These findings imply that governance prediction and governance performance studies have to overcome overly aggregated measures of code compliance which only incorporate the number of rejected code recommendations. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides evidence to practitioners and policy makers that firms can be classified regarding their compliance with the code recommendations. In-depth analyses of the identified patterns of compliance furthermore reveal that some patterns may indicate less well substantiated deviations from the code and partly even decouplings of the declared compliance practices.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

Corporate scandals due to bad accounting happen far too frequently for a system of corporate governance to be deemed effective. This book tells why the safeguards designed to prevent bad accounting so often fail. By studying why the auditors and members of a board of directors regularly fail to deliver the truth about a company's financial state of affairs, this provocative book explores a serious problem in the system of reporting financial information. This book is unique in that it draws together various strands of the literature on corporate governance, accounting, law, cognitive research, psychology, behavioural economics and conventional economics to shed light on questions regarding the feasibility of independence and impartiality of boards of directors and external auditors as monitors and gatekeepers in corporate governance. The book is essential reading for professional accountants and auditors, directors, regulators, law makers, corporate lawyers, and investment bankers. It will appeal to all those interested in behavioural economics and corporate governance. (c) 2008 Oliver Marnet. All rights reserved.

In light of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the effectiveness of good governance in Asian economies has been a confronting issue. This situation raised the key issue in corporate governance of how to effectively monitor managers and to exercise control so that managers act in the best interest of the shareholders. Amongst others, the existence of a board of directors is an important system for shareholding monitoring and control. This research empirically examines the relationship between board size, percentage of executives and performance of property companies listed in Malaysia. The findings provide evidence that the market seems to have a preference for small boards, but with more executive directors. (c) 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the potential role and the measurement of the effectiveness of boards of directors in strategy formulation and implementation - two aspects that have so far been left largely unaddressed by corporate governance research and practice. Design/methodology/ approach - Based on insights from strategy process literature, the paper suggests that, by ensuring consistency between resource allocation processes and the firm's intended strategy, boards could fulfil a meaningful role in strategy implementation. The proposed outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions is illustrated by a single case study of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company. Findings - The proposed approach enables corporate governance scholars to look at how boards fulfil their role in strategy implementation from a perspective similar to that of financial analysts. It might thus be suited to complement existing methods in empirical corporate governance research. Practical implications - The presented outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions helps board members to prevent role conflicts with executive management. In addition, boards may benefit from an analysis of implementation consistency, because it enables them to detect weak early warning signals of strategic divergence that require early intervention. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the discussion of alternative methods for exploring strategy issues in corporate governance research. The suggested approach outlines a potential new vantage point to investigate board involvement in strategy implementation in the event that action research is not feasible. The tentative findings from the case study put forward a set of indicators for measuring the effectiveness of boards in guiding strategy implementation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper seeks to investigate some current issues of ownership structure and corporate governance in China. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is a review, analysing issues of ownership structure and reviewing problems in corporate governance, followed by some suggestions for improvement. Findings - It is found that the heavily concentrated equity ownership in the hands of large state-owned shareholders mainly decides the status quo of the corporate governance system in China. In order to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance of Chinese-listed companies, it is imperative to restructure roles of the government, restrict hands of controlling shareholders, enhance independence of the board of directors, reform the supervisory board, set up independent directors-dominated sub-committees and align the interests of managers with those of the shareholders. Research limitations/implications - This paper only investigates Chinese-listed companies because of data availability. Practical implications - It has implications for policy makers in China insofar as it offers evidence concerning ownership structure and corporate governance of Chinese-listed companies. It also helps investors and trading partners (especially foreign ones) understand corporate governance and the investment environment in China. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by extending the mainly US-based board literature to China where there are important institutional differences in ownership structure and corporate governance system.

There is an absence of research about what information boards of directors have access to and how they use that information. The purpose of this paper is to explore and theorize about the content and use of information to boards of directors. The paper introduces and elaborates on the concept of 'board accounts', which is defined as the information supplied to boards of directors by top-management. The paper locates the board accounts in the Swedish institutional setting and demonstrates how the concept can be operationalized in an empirical setting. On the basis of a unique material of archived board records in a Swedish company, the paper explores the board accounts over a period of 10 years (1989-1998). It is found that while use of the board accounts in the case study company changes considerably over time, the content of the board accounts remains largely unchanged. This raises questions about where and when directors receive information, the reliability of the information in the board accounts, and recent attempts to integrate corporate governance and management accounting (CIMA, Performance reporting to boards: a guide to good practice, 2003; CIMA strategic scorecard: boards engaging in strategy, 2005; Seal, Management Accounting Research 17(4):389-408, 2006). Finally, the paper discusses the merits of historical archive-based approaches in this field and possibilities for future research. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper examines the ethics of contemporary managerial compensation in the context of executive stock options. Economic considerations would dictate that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate the effect of overall stock market movements which are beyond the control of the executive. However, in practice, most executive stock options are not adjusted to control for these outside factors. Agency considerations are the most likely culprit. Adjusting for the influence of outside factors, such as a generally rising stock market, from executive stock options sets a higher bar for managers to reach. Furthermore, traditional accounting standards permitted firms that did not adjust options to avoid reporting options as expenses. This presents CEOs and boards of directors with a major ethical dilemma. On the one hand, their duty to their shareholders and stakeholders dictates that executive stock options should be adjusted to eliminate outside noise from unrelated movements in the overall stock market. However, financial statements are presented in the language of accounting. If the overwhelming majority of the users of a language define a particular item in one way, then to deviate from the norm implies that the recipient of such a deviant statement may not properly interpret the statement. Likewise, if the standard practice is for firms to use unadjusted options and thus under-report expenses, to deviate from this industry norm risks that users of financial statements would not properly interpret the financial statements, with perhaps negative consequences for the shareholders. In short, if "everyone else does it," then it could be wrong for an individual firm to deviate from the norm as that would harm the shareholders. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Research about boards and governance has been characterized by the dominance of few concepts and a limited number of methods. This article introduces methods and concepts that help us explore board processes. Six illustrative studies of board processes are presented, including the use of 'one of the lads' - methods, 'flies on the wall' - methods, interpretation of 'board life stories' of women directors, reconstructive case studies and the use of questionnaire surveys directed to multiple respondents in each case. The article shows directions for how to open the 'black box' of board processes.

Purpose - Although board expertise has been identified as an important determinant of board performance, some surveys are still reporting that the overall level of board expertise is insufficient to carry out current and emerging roles. Consequently, companies must ensure that board members have the required skills and knowledge. This study aims to examine three board processes aimed at developing and improving board expertise. Design/methodology/approach - Based on disclosures in the corporate governance guidelines of 100 leading US companies, the study focuses on three board processes, i.e. director nominations, orientation and education programs, and board performance evaluations. Findings - Based on the initial findings, it is found that most companies in the sample were in compliance with stock exchange requirements and provided information on director nominations, orientation and education programs and board performance evaluations. All too often, however, the companies disclosed generic, non-specific information; this provides little reassurance that the proper processes are in place to promote companies' long-term interests. Research limitations/implications - By examining these key board processes, the paper contributes to the governance literature by providing empirical evidence on this important topic and offering guidance to companies examining board processes aimed at improving directors' overall expertise. Originality/value - By focusing on disclosures in corporate governance guidelines, the authors also gain insight into decisions made by companies under increased pressure from securities regulators and other stakeholders to provide increased transparency on governance issues.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

Managers have a unique fiduciary responsibility to shareholders of a firm that implies a set of ethical obligations. At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. (c) 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.

During recent decades boards have mostly been studied within a framework of corporate governance where the interests of external investors are emphasized. We will here break some new ground, offering a major survey on boards of directors throughout various European countries, and opening up the hitherto unexamined area of study of board behaviour and the workings of the value creating board. A framework is presented including concepts such as: the knowledge and diversity of board members; trust and interactions inside and outside the boardroom; board leadership and structure; boardroom decision-making; and corporate entrepreneurship and innovation. The value creation of boards is not only related to value protection for certain shareholders or value distribution to various stakeholders, but also to value creation throughout the whole value chain - as in relation to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship, for example.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

In this study, we examine firm and board characteristics that predict whether a new CEO will come from the firm's current management, from the board of directors, or from outside the firm. This study is the first to recognize the potential for outside board members to compete for the CEO position. Though classified as firm outsiders, outside directors have many of the advantages of insider candidates for CEO: firm-specific knowledge and familiarity with the board of directors. This form of succession is likely to be valuable in high-technology industries, as competition is faster paced and information asymmetry is greater than in lower technology industries. In this study, we focus on a single high-tech industry (semiconductors) in the period between 1993 and 2000. We find that the presence of an heir-apparent increases the likelihood of insider succession while outsider board members' availability increases the likelihood that an outside director will become the new CEO. We also find that firms with high levels of R&D spending and rapid sales growth favor insiders as new CEOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the CEO's relationship with the board.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

There has been concern expressed in the financial press and focus established in the accounting literature over rising levels of executive compensation. Individuals on the compensation committee, a sub-committee of the board of directors, collectively determine executive compensation and are responsible for maintaining the pay-for-performance standard, a concept that warrants further attention. This study examines the process of exaggeration of a group decision over individual beliefs and the impact of leadership upon a committee's outcome when making compensation awards. In an experiment with 98 subjects role-playing as compensation committee members, results show that in a committee of individuals where a coterie and a majority belief is present, group polarization occurs and the compensation results are exaggerated as compared to individual beliefs. The findings also suggest, though, that the appointment of a leader as chair of the committee, either in the majority or minority view, has a moderating effect on the group outcome. These results highlight and add to the literature the potential for agency costs in the group decision process that may be found in the executive compensation-setting environment.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

This paper examines board responsibilities and accountability by management and Board of Directors in relation to the National Australia Bank's (NABs) performance. The NAB, an international financial service provider within the top thirty most profitable banks in the world, is compared with the Australian major banks. The evidence suggests that NABs poor performance was consistent with a lack of accountability, poor corporate governance and board dysfunction associated with fraudulent currency trading and the subsequent AUD360 million foreign currency losses. The NAB's performance is investigated by utilising accounting-based measures of profitability and cost efficiency as proxies for performance. Following the foreign currency trading losses in 2004 the NAB under-performed the other major Australian banks in terms of profits, cost to income ratio and growth in assets. In terms of profitability and cost efficiency NAB had the lowest ROE and ROA with a 19.7% fall in net profit and the highest cost to income ratio of 57.4% of any of the five largest banks. This case study provides an Australian example of poor corporate governance and suggests that financial institutions and regulators can learn from the NAB's experience. Failure to have top-down accountability can have significant impact on over-all performance, profitability and reputation. In particular, it suggests that management and Boards need to review their risk management procedures and regulators need to be more pro-active in their prudential oversight of financial institutions.

Since the MM theory, scholars have discussed capital structure issues from the perspectives of agency problems in corporate governance. Corporate governance has been seen as the means to reducing the agency costs produced by aligning the interests of management and shareholders, and the incentive for the management to engage in opportunistic behavior has been influenced by the firm's ownership and board of director structures. Previous studies, however, focus on traditional financial factors and neglect the debt and equity agency problems triggered by corporate governance and their possible influences on capital structure decisions. The sample used in this study consists of 317 firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1998 to 2007. By controlling for the heterogeneity of industries and firm size, our models incorporate the cash flow rights-voting rights-seat control divergence, the ownership structure, and the structure of the board of directors to examine the effects of corporate governance on the firm's capital structure. The results show that, when the divergence between cash flow rights and seat control is lower or when the divergence between voting rights and seat control is higher, the controlling shareholders can either control the board of directors to better monitor the firm or exhibit a preference for debt financing based on entrenchment motives. Further analysis indicates that blockholders prefer lower debt financing and do not expropriate minority shareholders. Financial institutional shareholders function through their provision of monitoring and the certification of debts for technological firms and can decrease the firms' debts. The management in the technological industry firms prefers debt financing in order to obtain agency-related benefits. While directors in traditional industries or large firms might use personal or firm debt to tunnel the firm's assets, the function of independent directors in technological firms or large firms of lowering debts in order to reduce the firm's bankruptcy risks is more evident.

In light of the best practice recommendations released by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March 2003, this study tests the relationship between initial public offering (IPO) firm performance and board governance quality, captured by board size, board leadership, board composition, and director"s share ownership. Based on a sample of Australian IPO firms that lodged prospectuses with ASX between 1994 and 1999, we do not find evidence that links underpricing to board structures at the time of IPO. IPO firms' board structures are insignificant in explaining the level of IPO underpricing, and board size is the only board governance variable significant in explaining long-run aftermarket performance, after controlling for the size of the firm. That is, IPO firms with larger boards at the time of issuance perform better in the long-run, consistent with the resource dependence theory. Thus, we conclude that ASX"s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place, and our findings lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality.

Despite intensive efforts to determine the nature of the relationship between the firm size and the level of voluntary disclosure (VDI), empirical studies of this issue have produced mixed results. This paper attempts to delve deeper into this complex phenomenon by employing a resource dependency perspective to hypothesize a model of mediation as board of directors' quality index (BOQI) is moderated by a high concentration of CEO's ownership (HCEO). The findings suggest that the larger firm size, the higher is the BOQI and this in turn will lead to the higher VDI. These relationships appear to be weaker when there is moderation as HCEO, produced by the mediation process of the BOQI, and when this process is controlled, the residual moderation of the treatment effect is reduced. Further, board size as control variable is found to have a positive significant influence on BOQI and VDI.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the intensity of board activity, as represented by board meeting frequency, and firm financial performance, using data from the top 500 Australian companies. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return; several control variables are introduced in the analysis. The results indicate that board meeting frequency has a positive impact on subsequent shareholder return. Regarding the explanatory factors for the level of board activity, it is reported that firms with more board committees tend to have relatively more board and committee meetings; firms with larger boards have less board meetings. In addition, lower managerial ownership leads to more committee meetings.

This study analyses the influence of various characteristics of the Board of Directors on the control and risk of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It also examines the effect on these variables of some of the CEO personal characteristics and of various contingencies of the firm. The results reveal that control of the CEO compensation is determined fundamentally by the CEO participation in the capital of the firm, while the level of risk of the CEO compensation package is higher when the firm is diversified and implements a proactive competitive strategy.

In this paper the conceptual frameworks, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm risk-taking behaviour, are examined. From a sample of 243 Australian listed firms, it is found that leadership structure does not have any significant influence on firm risk; higher blockholder ownership or lower dividend payout is related to increased performance variance. This research suffers from some limitations; the archival study of the functional background of board chairman may not reveal the underlying relationship between the board of directors and firm risk-taking behaviour. We only test the influence of leadership structure on performance variance; further research could investigate the potential impact of board composition on firm risk-taking propensity.

In this paper several theories, which make different predictions about the effect of board leadership structure on firm performance, are tested. The results indicate that, for Australian listed companies, there is no strong relationship between leadership structure and subsequent performance. It is reported that companies with higher blockholder ownership or lower managerial shareholdings tend to have an affiliated chairman; firm with higher managerial shareholdings tend to have an executive chairman. The evidence suggests that there is no one optimal leadership structure; each structure, which could be an outcome of a rational choice process influenced by other governance characteristics of individual firms, may have associated costs and benefits.

The study sought to explore the role that director behavioral-type might play in leading to board effectiveness. The study involved direct observation of twenty-one boards of directors or committee meetings, together with interviews of 194 respondents. The study suggests that board process may be an equal if not more important factor than board structure in determining board effectiveness. The study's data suggests that board processes, in turn, may be influenced by the behavioral-types of individual board members. Based on the three dimensions of dissent/consensus; individual/collective; and persuasiveness/non-persuasiveness, five director behavioral types leading to a functional board emerged from the study including: (i) change agents; (ii) consensus-builders; (iii) counsellors; (iv) challengers; and (v) conductors. Five director behavioral types leading to a dysfunctional board also emerged including: (vi) controllers; (vii) conformists; (viii) cheerleaders; (ix) critics; and (x) caretakers. The study concludes with its limitations.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We review the recent developments in the area of codes of good governance, a set of best practice recommendations regarding the behavior and structure of the board of directors. Research Findings/Results: Our review of the literature on codes of good governance highlights their rapid spread around the world and how academic research has lagged behind in analyzing this topic. Despite the criticism that the codes' voluntary nature limits their ability to improve governance practices, codes of good governance appear to have generally improved the governance of countries that have adopted them, although there is need for additional reforms. Theoretical Implications: Unfortunately, research on codes of good governance has developed in insolation with little cross-fertilization across the different disciplines. We propose a multi-level framework to discuss three main topics that have emerged within the codes literature: the motivations behind the diffusion of codes across countries and its implications for convergence of corporate governance practices; the content of the codes and their "comply or explain" dimension; and the relationship between code compliance and firm performance. We conclude by proposing four areas of future research. Practitical Implications: Code development, adoption, and compliance are directly related to issues surrounding the governance of the firm, and in particular to all the interactions that a director has inside and outside the firm. Codes are regulations that emerge from policy-making negotiations between multiple stakeholders, such as the state (via the stock market regulators) and the investors.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

This study examines whether the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board of directors is associated with firms' timeliness in the remediation of material weaknesses (MWs) in internal control. The sample comprises accelerated filers that disclosed at least one MW from July 2003 to December 2004 under section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Using logistic regression analyses, I find that firms with larger audit committees, audit committees with greater nonaccounting financial expertise, and more independent boards are more likely to remediate MWs in a timely manner. These results suggest that the audit committee and the board play an important role in monitoring the remediation of MWs. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of the audit committee and the board under the SOX regime. The study also identifies important determinants of firms' timeliness in the remediation of MWs, which is key to improving financial reporting quality and restoring investor confidence. (c) CAAA.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The goal of this paper is to meta-analyze the results of 35 studies that examine the effect on earnings management of firms' boards of directors and ownership structure. We examine whether differences in results are attributable to moderating effects related to the system of corporate governance, the measurement of the governance variable, or the particular specifications of discretionary accruals models. Research Findings/Insights: The findings show that the variation in the results of previous studies on CEO duality and audit committee independence are caused by sampling error. In addition, the measurement of dependent variable, discretionary accruals, and the corporate governance system moderate the association between earnings management and some corporate governance variables. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The measurement of variables, especially discretionary accruals, influences the findings found in previous studies. The findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the legal and institutional setting when one analyzes the effect of mechanisms of corporate governance on discretionary accruals. Future research should include matrix correlations, and consider detailed measures of earnings management and more attributes of boards of directors in order to facilitate research using meta-analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results suggest that board independence, board size, and audit committee independence can improve investor confidence by constraining earnings management. Additional empirical evidence regarding refined measures of ownership and board, specifically board independence, would be very useful in gaining greater understanding of how the different approaches to these constructs influence earnings management.

We present results from a study about women and employee-elected board members, and fill some of the gaps in the literature about their contribution to board effectiveness. The empirical data are from a unique data set of Norwegian firms. Board effectiveness is evaluated in relation to board control tasks, including board corporate social responsibility (CSR) involvement. We found that the contributions of women and employee- elected board members varied depending on the board tasks studied. In the article we also explored the effects of the esteem of the women and employee-elected board members, and we used creative discussions in the boardroom as a mediating variable. Previous board research, including research about women and employeeelected directors, questions if the board members contribute to board effectiveness. The main message from this study is that it may be more important to ask how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and we need to open the black box of actual board behavior to explore how they may contribute.

It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board diversity, as represented by the percentage of female, minority or female and minority directors on the boards of directors, and firm financial performance, and to explore the potential determinants of board diversity, using data from the Australian corporate sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the top 500 Australian companies as the initial data-set. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate that gender and racial diversity do not have significant influence on performance. It is reported that larger firms tend to have relatively more female members, and smaller firms or firms with larger boards may have more minority directors. Research limitations/implications - The findings should not be extrapolated to all firms as the sample is restricted to listed companies. To examine the complete impact of board diversity future research could consider non-financial performance indicators. Practical implications - The analysis shows that greater diversity does not lead to poor performance, which suggests that gender and racial diversity could be achieved without a negative effect on shareholder wealth. Originality/value - In addition to giving improved evidence on the effect of gender diversity on performance, the paper may be the first study which ascertains whether there is a "business case" for greater minority participation in boardrooms in the Australian context.

Internationalisation is one of the biggest challenges for family businesses. Although prosperous locally, many of these firms often face several difficulties in entering foreign markets. To date, there are contrasting results with respect to the internationalisation behaviour of family businesses and the role of boards of directors in this process. Adopting the resource-based view of the firm, the paper focuses on the determinants of the internationalisation pathways taken by family businesses. Basing on a sample of 146 small and medium sized Norwegian family businesses, we find that the board is an important strategic resource contributing to their international expansion. The results highlight the existence of various relationships between board member characteristics, board tasks performance and the export intensity. In particular, we find that family businesses with higher levels of non-family board members are more likely to be international. Moreover, we find that boards' involvement in advisory tasks contributes positively to the export intensity. The implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the association between the composition of the board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Results: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition - board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition - the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical Implications: The results provide support for the managerial hegemony and the resource dependency theories. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by interlocking directors with extra-industry ties. Practical Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. Interlocking directors appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification. Existing recommendations and regulations to align management with shareholders' interests through independent boards should be revised. Board composition should also consider directors' knowledge, relevant expertise, availability, and length of tenure. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on gender and corporate boards of directors by focusing on how female board professionals construct particular notions of accessing and succeeding in boards. Design/methodology/approach: A discursive perspective is offered, based on conceiving gender as something that is "done" in social interaction. In the spirit of critical discourse analysis, the talk of female board professionals, produced in interviews in the Finnish context, is analyzed in-depth. Findings: Two discourses are located in the talk of female board professionals: the discourse of competence and the discourse of gender. It is argued that the discourses constitute a boardroom gender paradox, which is characterized by several contradictory elements. By conceptualizing and illustrating this paradox, the study scrutinizes the elusive ideal of women's large-scale entry into corporate boards. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should make use of the insights developed, and apply them to cross-societal comparative research. Practical implications: For corporate decision-makers, the findings suggest a rethinking of how "competence" is defined and applied. Originality/value: Paradox has rarely been addressed in the literature on gender and corporate boards. Understanding how the women interviewed (re)construct a boardroom gender paradox offers a unique contribution to the literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance in the context of recent corporate governance reforms, based on the agency and organisational literatures. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses 384 of the top 500 Australian companies as its dataset. Board composition measures include the percentages of affiliated, executive and independent members on the board. Firm risk is represented by the standard deviation of shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results show a negative impact of executive directors on subsequent risk. Affiliated and independent directors, however, have no significant effect on the level of performance variance. Blockholders give a positive influence on firm risk. Moreover, companies with poor dividend payout or low managerial shareholdings tend to be riskier. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not examine the actual risk preference of individual directors, which could involve an attitudinal survey of board members. Future research may also examine the specific attributes towards risk for each type of affiliated directors. Practical implications - The findings cast doubts on the hope that promoting board independence would reduce agency conflicts relating to managerial risk aversion, and support the proposition that, although firms may comply with the demands for more independent directors, they could employ a number of tactics to neutralize the power of outsiders. Originality/value - The empirical work surrounding this topic has been scant. This study may present the first Australian empirical evidence on the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Research on the roles of the board of unitary board systems is well established, while explorations of dual board systems are very limited. We know little about nonprofit sport organisations board roles in countries such as Taiwan that operate with a dual board structure. In consequence, this study explored the roles taken by the board of directors and the board of supervisors in Taiwanese nonprofit sport organisations. Four overarching board of director roles were identified: manage vision and purpose; board duty; human resource and fundraising; and stakeholder focus. For the board of supervisors two primary functions emerged: monitoring results; and board duty and process. The findings of the study extend our understanding of the governance of nonprofit sport organisations and the differences that exist between dual board and single board systems of governance.

This longitudinal study investigates the impact of national and international pressures to improve corporate governance in an emerging economy from an institutional theory perspective. Recently, family business groups (FBGs), the dominant form of organizing in emerging economies, have been criticized by policy makers for their poor governance structures. A common recommendation to FBGs has been increasing the number of independent, outsider directors on their boards. Thus, change in the board compositions of the quoted subsidiaries of the six biggest FBGs is analyzed over 2002-2006. One-way-ANOVA and t-tests were used as statistical tools. Findings reveal that there has not been a statistically significant change in board compositions over the research period. FBGs were found to resist institutional pressures through 'avoidance', 'defiance' and "manipulation" strategies due to the absence of coercive pressures and multiple forms of 'institutional work' for change.

The central question posed in this paper will be how to organize board composition in order to ensure a responsible corporate governance both from a CSR and a good governance perspective. Adopting a stakeholder approach to corporate governance, we analyze the arguments given by different theoretical approaches for linking specific board composition with financial performance and CSR, and discuss the empirical research conducted. Despite the inconclusive findings of empirical research, it can be argued that diverse stakeholders on the board will promote CSR activities within the firm, but at the same time will increase board capital (which ultimately may lead to a better financial performance). Finally, we propose a model for selecting board members based both on ethical and pragmatic arguments.

Given the increasing importance of corporate governance in the Philippines, this study attempts to explain the role of selected governance variables related to a company's board of directors in mitigating earnings management in the country. Using the financial statements of publicly listed companies and a modified measurement model, the findings revealed that the holding of multiple directorial positions by the independent directors, and the managerial ownership of the board are significant enough to limit the incentives for earnings management. Moreover, firm size and return on assets were identified to have explanatory significance among the controlling factors. (c) 2009 De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines.

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

This article develops an analytical framework for studying international organization (IO) boards of directors and applies the framework to a sample of 12 international organizations. It argues that the boards of IOs are asked by their political masters to play four distinct roles: (1) political counterweight, (2) performance police, (3) democratic forum, and (4) strategic thinker. Because there are trade-offs among them, no IO board can play all four roles effectively. Policymakers must therefore choose among them, and they must make choices of institutional design accordingly. The article also shows how in practice, international organizations fall into three governance "models" based on the characteristics of their boards of directors. Each model has a different combination of strengths and weaknesses. The analysis suggests that because trade-offs are inescapable, state actors sometimes willingly surrender a measure of control in order to strengthen other aspects of institutional performance. IO autonomy is often not something that surprises or annoys governments, but rather something that was been built into the institutional design as the result of a conscious trade-off.

This paper explores the relation between ownership structure, board composition and firm performance among Swedish listed firms. The descriptive statistics show that Swedish board of directors has become more diversified in terms of gender. The analysis shows that board size has a significant negative effect on investment performance. Gender diversity has a small but negative effect on investment performance, and the same holds for CEO being on the board. When incorporating all the explanatory variables into the same equation the negative effect of larger boards dilutes the effect of gender diversity and having the CEO on the board.

This research study focuses on the problems involved in nominating board members based solely on rules and regulations, which neglect the affective dynamics of board behaviour and board process. For example, choosing board candidates who are independent (not part of a company's management), a rule imposed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) guidelines, may ensure that an organisation remains listed on this lucrative exchange. However, it does not ensure that the candidates have the necessary knowledge or are well versed in the company's business activities to effectively serve on a particular board. Having independent board members does not ensure that they ask tough questions of themselves or of management or that they have an extensive network from which to draw for advice on strategic issues. These are equally important areas of board governance that cannot be ignored when choosing candidates for the board, and these questions should not be suppressed in favour of concentrating solely on formal concerns such as independence. Information about board characteristics can provide management theorists with a broader range of informal variables that can contribute to the decision-making process. Board characteristics assist the board in operating as a team, improving the efficiency of the board. Selecting board members with the most suitable and effective characteristics for a particular board ensures that directors are spending their limited time on the company's most important challenges. This research was carried out in several stages in order to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In this research there was a significant relationship for values and decision-making and no relationship for TSXFormal and decision-making, which is consistent with the literature, suggesting there must be a change in executives values to ensure changes in behaviour. A corporate governance model was developed. This model helps in ensuring that boards populated with board members who have knowledge and values (skills matrices) are more aware of the detrimental effect that groupthink can have on the decision-making process. Several executives mentioned the ability of board members to apply due diligence to strategic decision-making. This means that directors apply their experience and expertise to better understand issues and bring these to bear upon the decision-making process. Additionally, knowledge, values and groupthink (skill matrices) may be used both when nominating new board members and as an annual evaluative tool. Businesses are continually diversifying and board members need to continuously embellish their skill set and knowledge in order to adapt. However, the finding and the development of this corporate governance model are significant as they mark the start of how board characteristics can be operationalised. What is needed is more balanced research that looks at both the formal and the informal system. In doing so, more articulate measures of board decision-making process will evolve. The business environment is ever changing and dynamic; research in these areas will convey the interrelationship between the formal and informal system. Nevertheless, this research is unique as it has investigated the formal and informal system using both primary qualitative and quantitative data analysis and therefore provides much needed information about the characteristics requisite for nominating board members.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the argument that formal regulations alone may not be the defining factor in improving corporate governance and the decision making process of the BOD. Design/methodology/approach: Based on 20 semi-structured interviews with board chairs, members of corporate boards, CEOs, and upper/executive management at 12 Canadian companies, a bird's eye view is taken from the top. A content analysis of the interviews was performed. a clear picture about the interaction and behaviour of directors emerged. Subsequently, three objectives that are required for effective decision-making were developed: knowledge; motivation; and transmission channels/internal control. The analysis offers three critical objectives, which all boards should endeavour to accomplish. Findings: These interviews demystify board process and provide the bases for three critical objectives for effective corporate governance: ascertain and embellish the knowledge base of directors; motivate directors to share and gather information; and ensure clear and fluent transmission channels exist. Practical implications: The usual board measures such as CEO duality, insider and outsider ratio, number of board members and directors' share ownership may not be the only critical determinants of board effectiveness. Originality/value: Conventional notions of decision making have neglected key human faculties and individual characteristics that combine to determine organizational outcomes. This paper fulfils a need for research in the area of board processes and board decision making and provides a roadmap to improve corporate governance within organizations.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA; evaluate the corporate governance alternatives to "sayonpay" legislation; recommend a policy encouraging enhanced executive accountability; and suggest research questions pertaining to "sayonpay" proposals and executive compensation for scholars to pursue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes an exploratory approach to discussing and analyzing the issues surrounding "sayonpay" legislation in the USA and offering an alternative corporate governance approach to enhancing executive performance. Findings - The paper finds that whether an annual nonbinding "sayonpay" policy is instituted or not within a company is not the crux of the executive compensation issue. What is important is whether concerned shareholders have the ability to have proxy access and successfully pass such a resolution, thereby exercising shareholder pressure on the board of directors to implement a corporate policy of equating appropriate executive compensation with managerial performance. Moreover, this improvement in boardshareowner engagement, along with expanded disclosure of executive compensation packages, will assist in obviating the need for the exercise of a draconian shareholder resolution to remove directors. Originality/value - This paper offers an indepth review of the "sayonpay" legislative and corporate governance controversy; places the issue in the context of effective corporate governance; recommends a reasoned approach to executive compensation accountability; and offers a list of research questions for corporate governance and human resource management scholars to pursue.

Using a corporate governance scorecard (Corp-Gov Score) measuring twenty-six areas of corporate governance best practices in four UK banks, this study examined whether improved levels of corporate governance led to higher levels of firm performance within the UK banking industry over the time period 1999-2006. The twenty-six measures were split into four sub-sector areas of Corp-Gov Score comprising Board of Directors, Remuneration Policies, Auditing Policies, and Transparency/Disclosure Policies. Using both correlation and regression analysis on the information extracted from the Annual Reports, the study provides evidence about the extent to which UK banks have complied with recent corporate governance reforms post Enron. The results indicate that improvements in corporate governance can enhance the performance of UK banks when measuring using Return on Equity. The biggest sub-sector driver of this improvement is in the area of the Board of Directors. Our results further indicate that large boards within UK banks can have a negative impact on firm performance, and that increases in directors' remuneration does not lead to increased levels of firm performance. Evidence is given that corporate governance within UK banks plays an important role, but how it affects firm performance is open to debate.

The first part of this paper deals with the characteristics of one-tier board system in comparison with two-tier board system. The authors emphasize significant differences between the two systems of corporate governance, which should be critical for the owners when the decision about the appropriate system is about to be made. The introduction of one-tier system into the croatian law, as a result of harmonisation with the EU law, makes it possible for croatian joint stock companies to change the existing two-tier system into a new one-tier system. The theory of corporate governance stands in line with the main hypothesis of this paper - each corporate governance system is immanent to the specific legal environment, continental and anglosaxon. In order to prove their opinions regarding new practice in Croatia, the authors analize, in the second part of the paper, reasons for and model of changed corporate governance system in a croatin stock company. The analysis showed that this company choosed a specific model of one-tier corporate system - board of directors with executive directors outside the board. The analisied company showed the expected reasons for change - the change is a choice made by owners who are more familiar with one-tier system. In line with the theory and expectations regarding introduction of one-tier system in croatian stock companies, a following conclusion is made - the change to one-tier system will take place only in few companies and mostly because of the owner's linkage with one-tier system.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

The performance of healthcare non-profit public organisations is an important factor that can affect the quality of healthcare provision. This study attempts to investigate how board attributes affect board and organisational performance. Furthermore, it explores how dimensions of board effectiveness are related to organisational performance. In order to achieve these goals, survey questionnaires were sent to 120 CEOs of Greek public hospitals and 34 usable responses were received. The findings show some clear relationships between board attributes, board performance and some aspects of organisational performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Purpose: This paper seeks to address the effect that principle-based corporate governance practices have on the financial performance of large publicly-listed companies. In 2004, the New Zealand Securities Commission (NZSC) promulgated nine high level principles and guidelines for all business entities with an aim of improving corporate governance practices and boosting investor confidence in the New Zealand capital market. This event provides a point for empirically testing companies' responses. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data for the NZX top 50 companies over the period 1999-2007 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) regression techniques to evaluate whether: those firms that were continuously compliant with the NZSC requirements perform better; and the firm performance post-NZSC recommendations is better than pre-NZSC recommendations. Tobin's Q, market-to-book (MB) and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables.. Findings: The findings indicate that large listed companies have universally adopted the Securities Commission recommendations, establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, and having a majority of non-executive/independent directors on the board which, on average, have seven members. There is support for the view that the NZSC recommendations have had positive influence on firm performance measured by Tobin's Q, MB and ROA. The results show that the presence of a remuneration committee has had a positive influence on firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study provides empirical support for the corporate governance recommendations made by the NZSC in 2004, giving support to the principle-based corporate governance practices to be adopted in New Zealand. The sequential testing of each NZSC recommendation provides a comprehensive picture of performance outcomes which has not been achieved in prior research. The interdependency issues are of interest and the correlation between recommendations provides useful insights. Originality/value: This study offers insights for policy makers interested in adopting principle-based corporate governance practices within their country. Within New Zealand, public policy developments and stock exchange listing requirements/regulatory issues with associated compliance burdens are better informed as a consequence of the research.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

This paper examines audit report lag in Malaysian public listed companies, following the implementation of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2001. It departs from the standard audit report lag studies by incorporating characteristics of the board of directors and the audit committee. Multivariate analysis using 628 annual reports for the year ended 2002 indicates that active and larger audit committees shorten audit lag. However, we fail to find evidence that audit committee independence and expertise are associated with the timeliness of the audit report.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the relationship between board composition and firm performance using a board-level aggregation variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses linear regression to analyze the relationship between board role typology and firm performance using a panel data set of 277 non-financial listed Malaysian firms over the period 2002-2007. Findings: The empirical results show that firm-boards with a high representation of outside and foreign directors are associated with better performance compared to those firm-boards that have a majority of insider executive and affiliated non-executive directors. Research limitations/implications: The findings seem to imply that in widely owned firms a higher proportion of outsiders on the board reduces under-investment and agency problems, which has significant economic implications. Originality/value: This is the first study to use a board-level aggregation variable to demonstrate the impact of boards' resourcefulness on firm performance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the establishment of a risk management committee and board structures of Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee. These findings suggest that stronger boards demonstrate their commitment to and awareness of improved internal control environment. Finally, the study also documents a positive and significant association between firm size, complexity of a firm's operations, and the use of Big Four audit firms with the establishment of a risk management committee.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Why did the majority of directors prior to the financial crisis not have the foresight to predict the problems of taking on too much risk? We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

Compared to the debate on corporate governance in the private sector and to the literature on the macro level of governance in the public sector, the micro-level governance of public organisations remains a neglected area of discussion. Against this backdrop, the paper presents an overview of international literature regarding boards in the public sector organisations, in order to evidence if, and in which terms, the board of directors has been a topic of research in public governance in the recent years. In conclusion, the paper provides suggestions for future research on boards in public organisations. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Literature on acquisition places more concern on the consequence of an acquisition event and pays less attention to what factors influence the motive for initiating the acquisition strategy of a firm. Through the lenses of organizational learning and corporate governance theories, the study examine whether the prior acquisition experience and board characteristics affect firms' acquisition behavior. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 92 acquisition events of Taiwanese electronics firms during the period from 1997 to 2007 by employing the survival function model. Empirical results indicate that business acquisition experience positively influence the inclination of the acquirer adopting a subsequent acquisition, while board characteristics do not relate to the likelihood of the acquirer making a subsequent acquisition. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for organizational learning and corporate governance theories in general and acquisition management in particular.

Using a proprietary database for the largest 158 European companies during 1999-2004, I find that transparency of executive pay disclosures and sensitivity of executive pay to performance increase with the proportion of top executives serving as company directors and with dual chief executive officer (CEO) and board chairs. These relations strengthen in countries with more protection for outside shareholders. The positive marginal effects of executive directors (i.e., insiders) on transparency of pay disclosures and sensitivity of pay to performance are not significant when (1) insiders already have the numerical majority on boards, (2) CEOs are board chairs, and (3) pay levels and company ownership of executives are relatively high. Overall, the evidence supports the optimal-contracting argument over the rent-seeking argument. Specifically, companies mitigate agency costs associated with the existence of company executives on boards through transparent pay disclosures and incentive compensation. However, such actions are limited to companies with strong country-level investor protection and significant representation of independent directors on company boards.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the power dynamics of the boards of directors in family-owned and listed Turkish companies. Power and dominance in the boardroom can be studied in relation to three variables: the institutional environment in which the firm is embedded; the structural configurations of the board; and the top manager's propensity to exercise his/her power resources. Focusing on the board level, this paper aims to conceptualize power dynamics as being composed of structural attributes, roles assumed, responsibilities, dependency and representation. Design/methodology/approach: The research domain of this exploratory study is family-owned and listed companies operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). The data for the study were collected from three different sources: a survey administered to members of the boards of directors; discourse analysis of corporate governance compliance reports of the same companies; and in-depth interviews conducted with board members. Findings: This study shows that on a typical board of directors of a family-owned and listed Turkish company, the interests of owners and managers are aligned and other stakeholders are not represented; the role of the board is confined to visibility and legitimacy and does not include control. Originality/value: This paper argues that theories developed for Anglo-Saxon equity-market based business systems have limited exploratory power for an emerging economy - namely Turkey - that is based on a business system characterized by close co-operation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to research studies on boards of directors in the Chinese transition economy that are by far, few and limited. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses basic data compilation method to investigate the board characteristics of large and medium Chinese companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2006. Sample data on these companies were obtained from the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) database that contains information on at least 1,350 listed companies in a particular year. Companies with missing data or incomplete information on board attributes are not included in the sample in this paper. Studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance in the Chinese context are compared to those studies in the West for determining whether there is a conclusive empirical outcome. Findings: This investigation found some significant differences in board characteristics between the Chinese and Western contexts, such as non-compliance with legal requirement, equity-based compensation structure for board members, and lag in the establishment of Chinese board committees as compared to their counterparts in developed Western countries. In addition, the literature review reveals that studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance from the small community of scholars investigating the Chinese context produce inconclusive results similar to those studies of the West. Practical implications: The empirical findings and literature review suggest that the prototype of an effective board may vary from one industry to another, or even from one company to another, and perhaps across time for the same company. Originality/value: This contingency approach to board impact on firm performance may be relevant to companies operating in the Chinese transition economy, where factors are evolving continuously at the micro, macro, and international levels.

This paper analyses how the composition and ownership structure of boards of directors affect firms' R&D investments. Most research on the impact of the board focuses on corporate performance in an Anglo-American context. This study explores the influence of the board on R&D investments in the Spanish corporate governance system, which is different from the British and US systems. Data from 86 Spanish quoted companies in technology industries show that board composition influences R&D investments. Further, our results indicate that ownership structure can moderate the relation between board composition and R&D investments. This study states opposing hypotheses, based on arguments from agency and stewardship theories. We use these theories to analyse the influence of the board on R&D investments as a key factor for success in highly competitive technology industries. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

This article presents both theoretical and empirical support for a movement from a traditional governance research paradigm towards a more holistic research approach. This includes taking into account behavioural, contingency and evolutionary theories, in an effort to better understand governance processes and effective board behaviour. Specifically, the authors highlight the importance of three groups of relationships (board dynamics, board-management relationships and board-stakeholder relationships) as contributing to good governance practice. Whilst historically researchers have largely ignored the behavioural aspects of corporate governance, the authors have made an attempt to open the 'black box' of governance processes and practices, and illustrate with examples from three New Zealand companies how the development of these relationships are important for effective board functioning.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore two under-developed areas of board research: the corporate governance of unlisted companies; and board behaviour, focusing on process factors that contribute to a board performing effectively. Design/methodology/approach: The Board Effectiveness Questionnaire was completed by 67 directors, to gather views on how their board currently operates and how they think it should operate, across various behavioural areas relating to the relationships, decision making, the working climate and predispositions. Analysis of "process losses", the pattern of sub-optimal board behaviour, allowed the testing of four hypotheses concerning board effectiveness. Findings: The 18 most important and five least important behaviours were identified, plus 12 showing the greatest "process loss". Quality of team "relationships" is the main cause of loss whereas evidence for the impact of leadership style is mixed. Size of the board is related to overall performance of the board but number and proportion of non-executive directors are not. Research limitations/implications: This is a "purposive, judgmental" sample of all unlisted companies, derived from those who were willing and able to respond. Only one director's view of each board was sought. Practical implications: The picture of the "ideal" board provides a checklist for a company wishing to assess its board's performance as a working group, highlighting key characteristics that should be reflected on when discussing director/ board performance. The gaps in board behaviour identified could help other boards assess their own performance and researchers to focus on these areas. Originality/value: The paper explores two under-researched areas.

This article examined the effects of board structure of American media companies on their performance from a stakeholder perspective. Results showed that both the level of board interlocks and the proportion of non-independent directors on the board were positively associated with corporate performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity. Results also showed that the adoption of staggered boards had a positive effect on return on assets of media companies. However, this study did not find any relationship between board size and firm performance within media industries. (c) 2010 Journal of Media Business Studies.

The link between business and family is the track which follows an investigation in order to present the advantages and restrictions shown by organisations called as family businesses. This research contributes to the family business literature by demonstrating that the factor "relationship family-business" is more effective for understanding the family business behaviour than the traditional evolutionary cycle analysis. This article proves that the family-business relationship is manifested in the set of objectives, family and business. The organization pursues some objectives that are related to governance practices in each area (strategy process, succession, human resources and board of directors). The results demonstrate that the family business which integrates family and business objectives in their vision use family and business practices at the same level of importance.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a model to assess the effectiveness and compliance of bank boards, taking into account their unique characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on the roles and effectiveness of boards and directors in the financial industry is reviewed. Findings - The main finding in the literature suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of a board must include characteristics of the entire board as well as individual contributions of directors. Practical implications - Banking boards, more than in the past, must proactively evaluate their effectiveness and compliance with existing rules. Originality/value - The paper proposes a model for assessing the effectiveness and compliance of boards and directors of banking organizations, considering their characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

In the theoretical framework of corporate governance, this article studies the efficiency of the control exerted by the ownership structure and the board of directors on managers for the purpose of privileging investment in R&D. This efficiency is sensitive to national systems of governance. Tests realized on a sample of 531 U.S., Japanese and French firms with the canonical method corroborate the existence of positive relationships between concentration of ownership, the internal administrator dominance and the non-dual structure on the one hand, and the investment in R&D, on the other.

Using a large sample of European listed Companies and their Directors our study supports the hypothesis that European corporate governance do not yet converging towards a common model. Our results put in evidence in fact the existence of three dominant corporate governance profiles in European listed companies, different each others. The determinants of these profiles depend on the typical governance system adopted by the same companies and on country's culture and history; as a consequence, each of them has a own attitude of the board, in terms of structure, organization and skill mix characteristics. Finally we suggest some important implications on European governance practices.

We study the effect of the board of directors and the audit committee on the decision of auditor replacement. We analyze all the changes in auditors for all the non-financial firms listed in the Spanish capital market between 2004 and 2007. Our results show that the size, the composition and the number of meetings of both the board of directors and the auditing committee have a significant influence on auditor rotation. We also find that the replacement of the auditor does not mean better quality of financial information. The firms whose mechanisms of corporate governance fi t the most with the recommendations of good governance are the most prone to replace the auditor.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

The significance of boards of directors is often considered minor in unlisted companies due to the low degree of agency problems. Research on the topic has also been limited due to data access issues. However, networks are essential to the success of internationalizing new ventures and interlocked boards of directors have the potential to act as important information and resource conduits. To improve understanding on these dynamics, we performed an exploratory cluster analysis on board interlocks of Finnish software companies using board data we obtained from the Finnish Trade Registry and a custom survey. Our results indicate that companies that have international revenue are often interlocked with each other. In addition, companies without international revenue plan to internationalize if they have an interlock to a company that has international revenue. Our results are mirrored against management theory and future research is outlined. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The paper has two primary aims. First, to develop an appropriate network analysis to investigate whether any individual directors comprising the social network of New Zealand company directors is sufficiently connected so as to be in a position to exercise any form of cohesion, control or exertion of power. Second whether any directors could be identified as being in a position of power to take advantage of the network? This paper uses social network analysis to map and measure the structural features and patterns of relationships of the directors of companies listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and alternative exchange. The social network analysis was performed using the social network software Pajek(tm). The techniques used in the study reveal that the vertices (directors) in the network are moderately connected. The findings suggest that there is a small group of directors who are in a position to exercise cohesion, control and power over the network.

This paper uses a sample of 76 family businesses in Tunisia to investigate the impact of the family firm dynamic on the composition of their boards of directors. We argue that whether or not a transition in ownership is planned, firms have different governance needs and characteristics depending on the generational phase. The empirical results show that board composition is positively influenced by both generational evolution and succession planning. This study provides evidence of an increase in the appointment of outside directors to boards of family firms from the third generation of ownership. This result implies that it is important to consider the generational phase and succession process of the family firm in order to better understand its governance system.

Although gains have been made in recent years, women are still underrepresented on corporate boards of directors. Recently, however, the SEC has issued rules requiring public firms to disclose the "financial experts" serving on their audit committees. This study examines whether the skills and abilities necessary for service as a financial expert have affect the push for gender diversity in the boardroom. Analysis of a sample of S&P 500 and Russell Microcap firms shows that female participation corporate governance has increased since 2003, but that the growth is attributable to smaller firms. Increases in women representation among large firms appears to have slowed dramatically. Few women were named as audit committee financial experts immediately after implementation of the SEC requirement. By 2009, however, the number and percentage of women financial experts had increased significantly, reaching levels comparable to those for corporate boards as a whole. This study finds that gender diversity is not directly hampered by the specialized skills and experiences required of a financial expert.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

This paper looks at the issues of corporate governance in knowledge-intensive firms. It provides a conceptual understanding of major challenges faced by governance bodies of such firms in early stages of their development. The major question it asks is about a sustainable model of governance in knowledge-intensive firms. Traditional governance mechanisms of corporate control are neither appropriate nor effective means of protecting the company's interest. They can hardly enable the transition of individuals' intellectual capacity into organisational learning capacity. In firms where human capital plays a major role in gaining the company's competitive advantage, the board of directors has a difficult task in finding sustainable ways of controlling and retaining the sources of knowledge generation.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance structure and performance of Indian companies. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of selected board characteristics and ownership structure on the firm performance. This analysis ranges over a period of six years, from 2001-02 to 2006-07 and is based on Pharmaceutical and IT industry. Least square dummy variable regression model has been used to study the relationship. We find that while board size, listing status of firm and foreign shareholding has positive and significant relationship with firm performance, public shareholding has negative and significant impact. However, independent director proportion, participation rate of independent directors and separation of Chairman and CEO post does not have a significant relationship with firm performance.

The board of directors is seen as the central governance instrument, promoting interaction between stakeholders and promoting high performance, organization sustainability and return to investors. The practices and strategic definitions of corporative governance are considered of great importance today for corporations, due to the size and to the complexity of their structures (like M _ Forms structures) and the different forms in which they are presented: in networks, associations, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. The aim of this article is to analyze the constitution of boards of directors, based on their attributes, and the impacts of this classification on the roles and responsibilities of the directors in Brazilian companies. For this, a quantitative survey was performed in the 300 largest companies in Brazil listed in BOVESPA - stock exchange in capital market. The results found point to a strong correlation of some attributes of the directors of the researched firms with the roles and responsibilities of the board, in relation to strategic, control, and institutional dimensions.

We present a set of factors which can contribute to the effectiveness of boards of directors in managing strategy implementation. Following more recent research strands on corporate governance and boards, we focus on non-structural factors related to cognitive, behavioral, work process and power dimensions. They may enhance the explanatory power of structural features of boards where the latter's effectiveness is concerned. The identified factors are cohesiveness, presence of knowledge and skills, use of knowledge and skills, effort norms, cognitive conflict, task performance and information architecture. They were divided into sets of observable variables, which were consolidated into an instrument - reference lists - with a view to helping scholars and practitioners in assessing how boards rank in these factors.

The aim of this paper is to explain the particular characteristics of the corporate governance of banks and its role for good bank performance. In order to do that, it reviews the existing literature on this issue trying to answer three main questions: (i) Why are banks different? Existing research points at diverse features, such as, regulation, supervision, capital structure, risk, fiduciary relationships, ownership, and deposit insurance, that would make banks special and thereby influence their corporate governance. (ii) What is different about bank governance? According to past studies, banks' boards of directors are larger, more independent, have a superior number of committees and meet more often, but seem to play a weaker disciplinary role. Executive compensation would be higher in banking, but pay-performance sensitivity appears lower. (iii) What works for banks? Larger boards, more concentrated ownership structures and certain levels of managerial shareholdings are the principal factors suggested by the empirical evidence to date that seem to lead banks to higher performance.

Incorporating principles of sustainable development into management practices involves fundamental change which requires the support of a company's senior management as well as its governing bodies, particularly the board of directors and its affiliated committees. The aim of this paper is to analyze the rate of increase in awareness of sustainable development issues as well as incorporation of new regulations advocating 'best practice' in the area of corporate governance and explore links with the operation and composition of the board and its affiliated committees. This research has been conducted on the basis of case studies carried out over the period from 2002 to 2007 in relation to two French companies listed on the stock exchange. On basis of the two cases studies, it seems that there is no link between "good" governance practices in terms of composition of the board and adoption of SD into management.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This study sought to investigate if there is a link between women on boards of directors and corporate sustainability. Using a sample of publicly listed firms from Australia, the results suggest some level of support that a link does exist. Boards that have a strong complement of gender diversity are expected to offer more effective monitoring of agents, as well as offer more stringent enforcement of ethical conduct, thereby minimizing affects of subversion of shareholder funds that can be detrimental to their returns. Accordingly, findings confirm a positive link between women on boards and economic growth. Because of their relational abilities, women on boards are more likely able to engage with multiple stakeholders and respond to their needs, resulting in an avenue for demonstrating social responsiveness, which is confirmed by the results. However, due to their backgrounds and work experiences, sex-based biases and stereotyping might exist in boardrooms with men directors discounting input from women directors on issues relating to environmental quality. The results of this study find that women directors are not significantly associated with environmental quality. Discussion is given to these findings along with paths for future research.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How are national institutional systems related to the proportion of women found on corporate boards of directors of companies listed in particular countries? Which particular types of national institutions play the most important role? We explore cross-country variation in the pattern of female representation on corporate boards and evaluate the extent to which it is associated with the nature of national institutional systems as captured in five frameworks each of which emphasizes the importance of a distinct type of national institutions. Our analysis includes 38 countries and covers the years 2001-07. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that as much as half of the variation in the presence of women on corporate boards across countries is attributable to national institutional systems and that culturally and legally-oriented institutional systems appear to play the most significant role in shaping board diversity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study suggests that country-level institutions, previously neglected in studies of board diversity, play an important role in shaping the prevalence of women on corporate boards and that these need to be more fully incorporated in future research on board diversity. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The importance of national institutional systems for board diversity suggests that policy levers of a regulatory nature and national cultural characteristics are important elements in driving corporate board diversity and offer distinct opportunities for tailoring a mix of corporate governance interventions that suit the particular institutional nature of a given country.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The aim of this article is to analyse the internal mechanisms of corporate governance (board of directors and ownership structure), which influence voluntary disclosure of intangibles. The results appear to corroborate the view that an increase in institutional investor shareholding has a negative effect on voluntary disclosure, supporting the hypothesis of entrenchment, whereas an excessive ownership by institutional investors may have adverse effects on strategic disclosure decisions. The results also indicate that an increase in the number of members of the board to up to 15 has a beneficial effect on the disclosure of intangibles. However, as this number increases, the effect inverts and becomes adverse to improving the capacity for supervision and control in the decision-making process regarding the voluntary disclosure of intangibles. The findings endorse the recommendation of the most of the Corporate Governance Codes regarding an advisable maximum of 15 members on a board to ensure its effectiveness and internal cohesion.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to evidence the disclosure practices of Spanish companies in relation to a voluntary typology of strategic information; and to determine the factors that explain these practices. Among the factors considered, the study seeks to focus on the role of the Board of Directors in depth. According to Agency Theory, strategic information has positive consequences on external funds costs. On the other hand, Proprietary Costs theory limits these practices, given that they can lead to competitive disadvantages. Design/methodology/approach: First, online strategic information disclosure practices are analysed by examining non-financial quoted Spanish firms. A disclosure index is created, and subsequently, certain factors related to corporate governance - Activity, Size and Board Independence - as well as other factors traditionally analysed, are used to explain the volume of strategic information disclosed on the internet. Findings: The results indicate that Spanish companies, on average, give out little strategic information, mainly related to objectives, their mission, and the company's philosophy. "Company annual planning" and "Information on risks" are scarcely disclosed. The findings also emphasise that companies where the Chairperson of the Board is the same person as the CEO and, moreover, in which there is a lower frequency of meetings, disclose a greater amount of strategic information on their web sites. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the disclosure of strategic information is a decision taken by executives with the aim of satisfying the demands of creditors and investors. The Board of Directors represents the shareholders' interests, but it does not participate in strategic decision-making disclosure, maybe due to the fact that the proprietary costs lack influence. Originality/value: The link between corporate governance and strategic information disclosed online has scarcely been analysed in previous literature. This study provides interesting insights into how several Board characteristics can affect the disclosure of strategic information on the internet. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Relatively little is understood about factors triggering entrepreneurial behaviour within organizations not driven by profit motives. Governance plays an important role in non-profits, particularly boards of directors. Integrating resource-based theory and entrepreneurial orientation research, we examine the influence of non-profit boards as strategic resources shaping the organization's entrepreneurial orientation and performance. In particular, we focus on the non-profit board's underlying behavioural orientations, or the extent to which the board is strategic, activist, conservative, and cohesive. Findings from a cross-sectional survey on arts and culture organizations demonstrate that three of these behavioural orientations impact levels of entrepreneurship occurring within non-profits. Higher levels of entrepreneurship affect social performance, but not financial performance. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study seeks to find evidence of discrimination behind the scarce presence of women on Spanish boards of directors through factors within firms linked with different theories of discrimination.Research Findings/Insights: Using data on the boards of directors from the top 1,000 Spanish companies in 2005 and 2008, we identify some signals of discrimination. We find that women directors are scarcer in those sectors where there are fewer female managers or where the directors mainly draw on the firm's executive staff. There is also evidence of the dynamics of Becker's theory of discrimination, since time and competition seem to play in favor of a female presence on Spanish boards. We also find a contagion effect, implying a positive relationship between the number of women already on the board and the likelihood of adding a woman. This could signal some kind of underestimation of women's skills and preconceptions about their attitudes (such as risk-aversion) and hence their capacity to hold these positions.Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support for the prediction of Becker's theory of discrimination. The study also furnishes evidence in favor of the existence of false preconceptions concerning the skills and risk attitudes of female managers.Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to reduce discrimination before reaching the board we propose to implement education and mentoring initiatives to improve the training of the female candidates, and to improve the work- and family-life balance. Once they are included in the pool of candidates the implementation of good corporate governance practices related to transparency and objectivity in selection procedures and/or even the establishment of a women's quota on boards may contribute to dismiss employers' negative beliefs about the capabilities of female candidates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

This paper develops an analytical framework to depict the heterogeneity that characterises the role of board chair and demonstrate the potential variability in how chairs operate boards and exercise power and influence on strategy, control and resource related tasks at board level. Theories of power and influence, as applied to top management teams and boards of directors, are explicated within the context of contemporary governance practices that are establishing the role of the board chair as distinct to that of the chief executive officer. Specifically, the paper maps sources of power and varying contemporary chair practices, including chair nomenclature (i. e. executive vs. non-executive chairs), chair origin (insider vs. outsider) and chair time (full-time vs. part-time). A number of theoretical chair-power models emerge from this analysis and are subject to empirical analysis using data collected from 160 chairs of 500 FTSE-listed companies. Theoretically and empirically, the paper complements structural approaches to studying boards with attention to behaviour on boards. By linking board structure, board process and the exercise of influence, the study reveals both differences amongst chairs in how they run the board, but also that chairs' differ in the influence they exert on board-related tasks. Full-time executive chairs exert their greatest influence in strategy and resource dependence tasks whereas part-time, non-executive chairs seem to exert more influence over monitoring and control tasks.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Using firm-level corporate governance data for 385 IPO (initial public offering) firms that sought to be listed on Bursa Malaysia from 1999 to 2008, this study examines the relationship between board structures and IPO underpricing, a performance indicator unique to the IPO context. The study finds that there has been recently a reasonably high level of underpricing in the Malaysian IPO market. Contrary to the prediction of this study, the results indicate that dual leadership structure and board reputation (i.e., multiple board memberships) are positively and significantly associated with the extent of IPO underpricing. It appears that the separation of board chair and CEO positions signals low quality for the IPO firm. Because of the risky nature of IPO firms, investors tend to favour continuity in leadership. Directors who hold outside board memberships with other firms also have a negative effect on investors' assessments of firm quality. Potential investors feel that directors with numerous board seats are inclined to become distracted in which case monitoring intensity is likely to suffer. Other board variables, namely, board independence (i.e., board composition) and board size, do not significantly link to underpricing. Finally, the study finds that both firm size and the total number of risks factors disclosed are negatively and significantly related to underpricing. Overall, these results provide evidence supporting that good corporate governance practices are likely to help potential investors identify quality IPO firms.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

In the wake of this decade's corporate scandals, crimes and excesses, improving the effectiveness of corporate governance in the United States has become a priority. An important influence on a board's effectiveness at monitoring is its members degree of independence from senior management. While the current definition of independence revolves around the absence of familial and economic connections between a firm and its directors, research suggests that this standard may be inadequate in ensuring independent oversight. Rather, diversity along racial, gender and other dimensions has been proposed as a potentially more effective standard for board independence. This is especially welcome news for women, who currently comprise 51 per cent of the US managerial workforce but only 14.8 per cent of the directors on boards of large, publicly traded US corporations. Some explain the current dearth of women board members by claiming that there are no qualified women available for board service and/or that women are not interested in board service. However, there is more anecdotal rather than empirical evidence on the issue. Surveying women at a women's leadership conference in Boston, this research investigates the extent to which women are currently involved in some type of board service and the extent to which women aspire to future board service. We find that women are currently more active in governance activities than prior research on corporate boards suggests and that they aspire to play a continued and expanded role in governance activities.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board of directors' independence and executive compensation disclosures transparency. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines compensation disclosure practices of a sample of 181 firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Board independence from management is assessed through an aggregate score which takes into account the proportion of independent directors, board leadership structure (i.e. CEO is the board chairperson), and the existence and independence of board committees. A cross-sectional regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between board independence and the extent of compensation disclosure. Findings - The paper finds that board independence from management is positively related to the transparency of executive compensation-related information. In addition, this study documents a positive (negative) relation between firm size, US cross-listing, growth opportunities (leverage) and the extent of executive compensation disclosure. Research limitations/implications - The study's results provide support to the managerial opportunism hypothesis in executive compensation. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors as an effective governance mechanism which limits managerial rent-seeking in the design as well as the disclosure of executive compensation practices. Originality/value - This paper extends prior disclosure studies by examining the impact of board characteristics on the transparency of executive compensation disclosures in a principles-based governance regime. Furthermore, executive compensation disclosure provides an interesting setting in which to examine the ability of the directors to act independently from managers in a conflict of interests situation.

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether the qualitative dimension of the ownership structure, in particular the family identity of the controlling shareholder, infl uences the optimal configuration of the Board of Directors, as well as the effect that such configuration has on firm value creation. The econometric technique used, the system estimator of the Generalized Method of Moments, applied to a panel of Spanish family and non-family listed companies in the period 2001-2007, allows us to solve the traditional problem of endogeneity existing in studies of corporate governance. The results show how the need for advising and monitoring depends on the family nature of the controlling shareholder and, therefore, the optimal structure of the Board of Directors differs between the two classes of companies under consideration. Among the main conclusions, we found that, contrary to the widespread believe, smaller and more independent boards are not always more efficient.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw on the perspectives and experiences of New Zealand board members to propose a balanced scorecard (BSC) for use in measuring and managing the performance of boards. Design/methodology/approach The views of 35 board members were elicited via semi-structured interviews. The interview evidence was analysed using a multi-step coding process to arrive at key themes on the functions, characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. These themes were then used as a basis for proposing an appropriate structure and content for a BSC that reflects board members' perceptions of key factors driving board performance. Findings New Zealand board members see behavioural measures of board performance as generally more useful than operational and financial measures. Further, strong relationships and strategic clarity are seen as both drivers of good performance and key outcomes of effective boards. Consequently, the proposed BSC incorporates multi-dimensional outcome (i.e. lagging) measures. It also recognises the importance of including subjective measures, rather than focusing on readily quantifiable measures that board members perceive as less informative. Research limitations/implications This paper provides insight into the perspectives of practising board members and informs the literature on board effectiveness. The proposed BSC adds to the performance management literature in regard to evaluating and managing the performance of boards. However, further studies are now required to test its practical utility. Practical implications The proposed BSC provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating the performance of boards of directors. Originality/value Few studies of board effectiveness have accessed the views and experiences of practising board members as this study does. Also, little prior research exists on the potential for applying a BSC approach to measuring and managing board performance. (c) Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance practices on auditors' decisions (judgments), especially, the client acceptance decision in Egypt, where corporate governance is neither mandatory nor legally binding. Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out through a 2x2 experimental design with a strong level of corporate governance (the board of directors and audit committee) versus a weak level of corporate governance (the board of directors and audit committee). Findings: The findings of the study revealed that strong corporate governance is associated with more favorable acceptance judgments than weak corporate governance. These results suggest that the voluntary adoption of corporate governance practices by Egyptian companies enhances the quality of financial reporting process and, therefore, affects auditors' decisions (judgments). Research limitations/implications: The results of the study should be considered by regulators in Egypt in order to begin the necessary actions for legally pending the Egypt Code of Corporate Governance, issued on October 2005. However, owing to the relatively small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the limited body of research on the impact of corporate governance on auditor's client acceptance decision by examining this impact in Egypt, where corporate governance is still not mandatory.

Stemming from different theoretical perspectives the article examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, local governments, private shareholders, service providers) that at various levels are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on 10 Italian listed local public utilities are summarized. Different and coexisting situations of conflicts of interest among multiple principals and agents are identified. In this context, governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts. However, our findings suggest that the ownership structure influences board composition and functioning and that higher numbers of independent directors do not necessarily mean "actual" board independence. The article contributes to the debate on conflicts of interest and governance mechanisms in local public utilities. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

This research focuses on the board role evolution analysis which took place simultaneously with the development of different corporate governance theories and perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to provide understanding of key factors that make a board effective in the performance of its role. We argue that analysis of board role performance should incorporate both structural and process variables. This paper's contribution is the development of an integrative model that aims to establish the relationship between the board structure and processes on the one hand, and board role performance on the other.

This paper questions the feasibility of corporate governance and a company's Board Members being able to serve two masters at once: shareholders; and the many different agents inhabiting the labyrinth of the stakeholder universe. Absurdist reasoning will be used to demonstrate the theoretical impossibility of a dual legitimacy. An alternative 'Enlightened shareholder theory' will be proposed, inspired by Jensen's 'Enlightened partnership theory' (2001). After demonstrating that a company's interest is not synonymous with the interests of its shareholders, a proposition will be made that Board Members should always highlight social interests. The paper's conclusion will identify the consequences of the new theoretical framework for the definition of corporate governance; Board Members' missions; and the composition of a Board of Directors.

This paper examines the relationship between strategic orientation and board roles. In particular, the research looks at how board roles of nonprofit sport organisations with a dual board structure are associated with organisational strategy in 25 summer Olympic sport organisations in Taiwan. The study found that the majority of board roles for both directors and supervisors can be statistically distinguished from each other in relation to organisational strategic orientation. The study advances the understanding of nonprofit board roles and practices by differentiating between board of directors and board of supervisors. Furthermore, the findings support using specific recruitment practices that should strengthen nonprofit boards. This finding can also support further research into the relationship between an organisation's strategic orientation and other governance elements, including board composition, structure and culture.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between board alignment with shareholder interests using a new measure of perceived board effectiveness, which is designed to capture the alignment of the directors with the interests of shareholders. Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, the paper looks at the Rotman/Clarkson (CCBE2) Canadian Board Shareholder Confidence Index as the measure of shareholder's perceptions of the board's efficiency as it relates to company performance. The index is ostensibly designed to capture the essential factors affecting shareholders' confidence in the boards' abilities to fulfill their duties. The CCBE2 Board Shareholder Confidence Index assigns scores to companies based on the consideration of the following three perspectives: potential of individual board members; potential of the board as a group and past practices of the board. The measure of performance is the firm's Economic Value Addede (ER), which is a metric for a company's ability to generate economic profits that enhance the wealth for shareholders. Findings - Based on regression analysis, it is found that high shareholder confidence index values are generally associated with higher ER, although the relationship is not monotonic for higher graded boards. This suggests that while highly graded boards are generally beneficial, there may be diminishing returns to efforts to design "optimal" boards in the sense of their alignment with shareholder interests. The performance gap between firms with high vs low expected agency costs as reflected in terms of higher differentials between board members' interests alignments with those of shareholders amounts to almost 30 percent. Originality/value - This paper is the first study to appear that looks at how a new, comprehensive measure of board alignment with shareholder interests relates to company performance. The findings should be of considerable interest to investors, policy makers, and firms looking at the incentive structures for directors, and how aligning directors interests with those of shareholders can create economic value for firms.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

Today, many media corporations are linked together through interlocking boards of directors. Are these interlocks legal, especially in an ever-converging media environment? This study of interlocks finds that over 40% of leading media corporations are interlocked with another leading media company. The majority of these interlocks are legal under current media conditions, but that may change as media formats converge. In addition, the legality of 2 board interlocks is questioned and discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze how the level of adherence to sustainable development principles has evolved and also how the integration of new "good" governing rules has evolved in conjunction with the formation and functioning of the boards of directors and their committees. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports the results of a comparative case study - three French companies in the building sector - based on both primary and secondary data for the period 2002 to 2007. Findings: It is found that the companies showed that they were capable of integrating sustainable development principles into their way of management; they also developed their rules of governance - in particular with regard to the constitution and the operating rules of their board of directors. Originality/value: This study provides recent developments regarding sustainable development applied to company management, in the building sector in France. It also gives precise and recent information on the development of corporate governance rules. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A considerable amount of research has been done on the figure of the CEO, approaching it from many angles. Our analysis focuses on the role played by the independent director in the supervision and turnover of the chief corporate executive. In the process, we have carried out a comprehensive reflection on the independent director, consulting the latest literature and including the results of the most recent empirical evidence. We have noticed that the role of the independent director often goes beyond the tasks that are usually considered specific to this function, namely, supervision of the company's senior management. However, the directors' independence cannot be built by requirements. It is a personal quality of the individual that transcends the various problems raised by agency theory. We believe that correct CEO supervision can only be effectively undertaken if the independent directors have these personal qualities. It seems that companies with a larger number of independent directors are more likely to replace the CEO when performance is not as expected. This can only happen if the independent directors enjoy effective independence.

The purpose of this paper is to compare the levels of representation of women on boards of directors in five countries, and especially to determine if the culture of a country is a factor that influences the possibility of women achieving positions on boards of directors. We use the cultural dimensions of Hofstede (1980) and GLOBE (House et al., 2004), and the results show that the culture of a country can be a factor in explaining the different levels of representation of women at board of directors. In particular, three of the four cultural dimensions are seen to be significant: power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity.

The literature on the relationships between board attributes and corporate performance is mixed, and one important reason is that the intermediate variable, i.e., board behaviors are ignored. With the data coming from listed company of China, the paper empirically researches the relationship between the characteristics and monitoring function of board. Using Principal Component Analysis, we get 6 variables reflecting the characteristics of board and 4 variables for the monitoring function. The study shows that the share held ratio of board's members has a negative impact on the directing function of board significantly, but the gender ratio and the average age of board members has a positive impact on the position function of board significantly. This may be valuable to regulate the behavior of board. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This paper explores board decision-making in social enterprises. It argues that while dominant theoretical frameworks (agency and stakeholder theories) help to understand the challenges faced by the boards of social enterprises, they need to be complemented to account, more adequately, for challenges deriving from the confounding logics framing valuations of organizational effectiveness in social enterprises. The paper identifies pace of decision-making as a crucial variable that requires further research attention and, building on the literature on group decision and dynamics, it advances several factors that can frame the expediency (or sluggishness) with which the boards of social enterprises take decisions.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

In Spanish listed firms, taking into account the predominant modes of ownership structure, which are characterized by a high concentration of shares in the hands of a few shareholders who are strongly represented on the board of directors, it might suppose that there are strong stimulus for a close top managers' supervision and a straight interest alignment. However, the empirical evidence indicates the opposite, and this paradox needs to be explained within the theoretical framework of institutional theory. The high concentration of ownership and the high level of cross-holdings generate conflicting interests by those who have multiple roles as directors and top managers, suggesting that board's supervisory effectiveness may be compromised by social pressures in search of legitimacy. These features of Spanish firms are undermining governance mechanisms, and may explain the high pay levels, the low variable packages and, in general, the lack of connection between top managers' compensation and firm performance in comparison with those in other countries of Continental Europe.

This study scrutinises the association between ownership identity and board size in a unique institutional setting: state-owned enterprises in Indonesia, a country incorporating a two-tier management structure. It investigates whether the ownership identity explains the size of the board of commissioners by using the year 2006 data set from 155 SOEs in Indonesia consisting of 112 of fully SOEs and 43 of partially- privatised SOEs. This study hypothesizes that SOEs with a higher level of private sector ownership will have a greater incentive to monitor the performance of executive management through board of commissioners than those SOEs that are fully owned by the state government. It finds that compared to those fully SOEs, the partially-privatised SOEs are likely to have more board of commissioners. Even though this result is not statistically significant and, therefore, the proposed hypothesis is not statistically supported, the regression statistical analysis reveals that control variables assist in explaining the size of board of commissioners. The size of the board of directors as a control variable is significantly associated with the size of the board of commissioners. Other control variables including size of the SOE as well as the return on equity measure moderately explain the size of the board of commissioners. The findings give insight to stakeholders such as regulators or the private sector investors interested in making investment decisions in Indonesia considering the ownership structure and the effect on the effectiveness of the board of commissioners.

The failure of the CEO has been studied at great length in the literature. We order and classify the factors that lead to CEO failure into those a CEO can influence (endogenous) and those that are given (exogenous). The absence of unanimity in the literature leads us to conclude that insufficient attention has been paid to the main factor: the personal characteristics of CEOs. The agency approach and method are insufficient to understand leadership performance in organizations, due to the oversimplified view of human nature on which they are based and their heavy reliance on mathematical modeling.

Corporate governance scholars are increasingly interested in firms' social and environmental performance. Empirical research in this area, however, has moved forward in an uncoordinated fashion, producing fragmented and contradictory results. Our paper seeks to address this situation by adopting a fact-based research approach that comprehensively explores the link between corporate governance and environmental performance. Specifically, we aim to understand how the relationships between and among the firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors influence environmental performance. We are particularly interested in understanding the interactions among these three key sets of actors. In the end, we offer some observations about governance practices and discuss the implications for theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, this paper examines the relationship of board composition, leadership and structure on sustainability disclosure. We discuss that good corporate governance and sustainability disclosure can be seen as complementary mechanisms of legitimacy that companies may use to dialogue with stakeholders. Specifically we claim that, as disclosure policies emanate from the board of directors, sustainability disclosure may be a function of the board attributes: we investigate the relationship between different characteristics of the board and sustainability disclosures among US and European companies. Our results show that in order to explain the effect of board composition on sustainability disclosure we need to go beyond the narrow and traditional distinction between insider and independent directors, focusing on the specific characteristics of each director.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate board characteristics on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms. Board characteristics studied comprise board size, board skill, board nationality, board gender, board ethnicity and CEO duality. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the random-effects and fixed-effects generalised least squares (GLS) regression to test the six hypotheses formulated for the study, while controlling for firm size and firm age. Findings: Using panel data from 122 quoted firms in Nigeria between 1991 and 2008, it was found that board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were negatively linked with firm performance, whereas board nationality, board ethnicity and the number of board members with a PhD qualification were found to impact positively on firm performance. The result of the robustness test using the same board characteristics for 160 small firms showed that board duality was positively linked to firm performance, while a PhD qualification was negatively linked to firm performance. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of the board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality and other organisational attributes such as ethnic diversity, foreign nationality and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively. The results provide an insight for practitioners and policy makers on the importance of relying on institutional specifics in the prescription of corporate governance codes. Originality/value: The study adds value to the global corporate governance discourse in two ways: first, the use of Nigeria, which is claimed to have one of the weakest business cultures in the world, and secondly, using a good number of proxies that are country-specific for corporate boards.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines how the composition and characteristics of corporate boards relates to firms' success and solvency; the study here focuses on the question of insolvency. This study finds that both board composition and member characteristics relate to whether or not firms can avoid bankruptcy. Boards have a major role to play in whether or not the company can remain solvent. A more versus less independent board, one which is larger and comprised of older members, has more members currently serving as CEOs of other companies, and whose independent/outside directors own less stock is best positioned to help a firm remain out of bankruptcy. Firms may use the results to custom tailor boards as older members retire and new members are inducted. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc..

Using a sample of 4,278 listed UK firms, we construct a social network of directorship-interlocks that comprises 31,495 directors. We use social capital theory and techniques developed in social network analysis to measure a director's connectedness and investigate whether this connectedness is associated with their compensation level and their firms overall performance. We find connectedness is positively associated with compensation and with the firm's future performance. The results do not support the view that executive and outside directors use their connections to extract economic rents. Rather the company compensates these individuals for the resources these better connections provide to the firm. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Previous research brought evidence of the influence of board composition for bringing strategic resources for innovation, as well as evidence of positive outcomes of board diversity. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of various indicators of board diversity on innovation. In this paper, we will explore the relationship between several aspects of board diversity (gender and age) and four types of innovation, i.e. product, process, organizational, marketing from a sample of 176 French firms based on data from French Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in 2008 and annual reports. Our results show evidence of the influence of board diversity on all types of innovation except process innovation. Findings provide discussions for the impact of board diversity on innovation.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines innovation investment during the major economic downturn of 2008-2009. Drawing from prospect theory, it suggests that increasing levels of slack resources enhance innovation investment during a crisis; slack resources also moderate the impact of historical performance on investment. This study also examines how, during global crises, the board of directors can affect the CEO's proclivity to invest by leveraging performance management devices, such as target-setting and behavioural evaluation criteria. A test based on a sample of Italian companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. Results suggest that firms may respond to global crisis with innovation investment, and that organizational factors, as well as the board of directors, may play a major role in this response.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

This study examines the impact of corporate boards on firm performance during the current financial crisis. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the crisis to measure firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we redefine independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call strong independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. We find that the positive impact of outside financial experts on firm performance is more significant than that of strong independence. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

This paper investigates gender differences on the corporate boards of Finnish listed companies. The personal characteristics, careers, and boardroom roles of female and male directors on boards were analyzed on the basis of empirical data collected by questionnaire. An analysis of the findings revealed only minor differences between the women and men in personal characteristics such as their marital status, number of children and education, or in their careers. However, female board members were on average younger than their male counterparts and considered themselves to be more protean, took more active roles on the board, and enjoyed power more than men did. They also felt a need for more women on the board. The goal of this study is to contribute to the existing research in two ways. Firstly, it provides empirical evidence on women's representation on boards from Finland, where women's and men's rights are regarded as more equal than in many other countries. Secondly, the study aims to increase our knowledge of gender differences, careers and roles of women in top positions in Finnish business. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effects of corporate governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, and executive bonus pay in Japanese firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of the largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth and bonus pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability and bonus pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability and bonus pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth and bonus pay relationship. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study makes a contribution to research on ownership heterogeneity and executive compensation by empirically showing that different owners and directors affiliated with certain ownership groups have varied implications on the firm performance-executive pay relationship. It also makes a contribution to research on corporate governance change by providing insights on how different actors facilitate shifts in the linkage between performance and pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

In order to compete, firms must constantly gather and assess information that will help them identify and evaluate emerging opportunities. Their social context is instrumental in determining what information they have to work with and how they might make sense of and act upon that information. Unfortunately, many firms allow themselves to become under-connected, which isolates them from new sources of information, or over-reliant on just a few connections, creating a bottleneck for the flow of information. Herein, we describe how these problems manifest themselves among the network of interlocked directors, which is created when directors of firms sit on multiple boards. This network is so vast and complex that fully understanding the position and structure of a given firm's board interlocks remains elusive. Toward solving this problem, we offer five keys to developing a board with effective interlocks, as well as three cautions regarding how board interlocks could potentially hurt firms.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparatively little empirical attention has been paid to the leadership of nonprofit board chairs. This article reports findings from a two-year mixed-method grounded theory research investigation exploring perceptions of board chair leadership and impact from the perspective of those who interact with chairs (board members, chief executives, and stakeholders). It provides a review of the literature on the leadership role and impact of board chairs and a conceptual framework for its study in nonprofit and voluntary organizations. We present and discuss findings from two phases of the research and offer theoretical perspectives on board chair leadership effectiveness and practical suggestions to increase it.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

The objective of this paper is to determine the managerial governance characteristics related to financially distress companies. The failure of boards to accomplish their monitoring duties seemed to be one of the main reasons behind the actual financial distress and bankruptcy that swept companies across the planet. Through the analysis of a sample of 178 Lebanese non-listed and family owned firms, the results showed that the boards (that have a higher proportion of outside directors) are less inclined to face financial distress than the boards with a lower proportion. In addition, a different conclusion proves that the board's size and financial distress are directly linked. The paper highlights the extent to which financial distress is associated with corporate governance from a Euro Mediterranean country. It would be a source of education to Lebanese investors, who excessively go for short-term returns, and of help to regulatory authorities in the framework of making policies on corporate governance reformation.

Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.

Corporatization, or the adoption of more business-like practices or governance arrangements by government agencies, has been shown to lead to improvements in performance. However, why corporatization leads to improved performance is not well understood. There are competing theories as to how corporatization may improve performance, but because of confounding factors empirical studies have difficulty in identifying causal relationships. We address these issues in our analysis of the corporatization of six Australian state forest agencies that took place in the past two decades, focusing on: (1) improvements in efficiency and (2) improved profitability or cost recovery. The results confirm that corporatization leads to enhanced commercial performance through improving clarity around business decisions and increasing the autonomy of managers. A key feature is the establishment of new governance arrangements and how they are implemented. Our results suggest that mechanisms such as the creation of an "independent" board of directors are important to create an "arm's length" relationship between the government and the new entity, thereby improving clarity in business decisions.

The fields of leadership and corporate governance e have, in their own rights, become the domains of significant interest recently for academics and business practitioners alike. While they often focus on similar phenomena, they rarely interact or engage with each other. In this chapter we argue that there is much to be gained by integrating and cross-fertilizing research efforts within the corporate governance and leadership research fields. Their strengths and weaknesses mutually complement each other: leadership has been traditionally strong in highlighting significant interpersonal dynamic processes within organizations but has been biased by its attention to the middle and lower ranks of the organization. Corporate governance, on the other hand, has developed an upper echelons perspective but have been hamstrung by a preoccupation with formal, static and impersonal theoretical models. We therefore suggest that there is much to be gained by creating a theoretical rapprochement between the two fields which will have positive repercussions not only in terms of fresh empirical insights but also in terms of improving and energizing the everyday practice of corporate governance. By way of example, we highlight three important intersections at which governance and leadership processes can come together in any organization: team leadership on the board, the chair's leadership of the board and strategic leadership by the board. We conclude by raising a number of research questions that can be profitably researched by taking both a 'leadership in governance' and a 'governance in leadership' perspective.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gender composition of the board of directors of Malaysian initial public offering (IPO) companies. This study also examines the business case for having women on boards. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 228 IPO companies that went public during the period 1999-2006, this study tracks the changes in the gender composition of these companies prior to the IPO year, IPO year and three-year post-IPOs. This study also tracks the changes in the gender composition between the pre-IPO period and some 5 to 12 years later after the IPOs for a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) in 2011. The compounded buy-and-hold returns method is used to measure the post-IPO company performance. Findings: This study finds that female representation as board of directors in 228 Malaysian companies prior to the IPO is only about 8 percent. This percentage is almost similar for the subsequent four years (IPO year and three-year post-IPOs). By using a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies in 2011, the percentage of female directors increases only 2.5 percent from the pre-IPO year. However, the increment is not statistically significant. An extended analysis on the business case for women on boards reveals that greater percentage of female representation leads to lower long run underperformance. This underperformance is much lower for companies having more foreign ethnic female representation. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study suggest that there is still a long way to realize the benefits of having female directors in Malaysian companies. Malaysia needs to create an environment that realizes the benefits of having women in the top management levels. Originality/value: This research contributes to the existing literature on gender especially in the context of IPO companies. This is the first comprehensive study on gender composition using Malaysian IPOs data. Prior studies on gender mainly focus on established listed companies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Malaysia is one of the rapidly developing economies in South-East Asia which embraces the concept of good corporate governance due to the 1997-1998 Asian financial crises. This study investigates the relationship between board of directors and company's capital structure in an emerging market, Malaysia. This research paper covers 75 non-financial leading Malaysian companies, which are employed as a price index, listed on Kuala Lumpur stock exchange (KLSE) from the year 2005 to 2008 fiscal years. A multiple regression analysis has been used to examine the linkage between board of director's features and capital structure decisions of the listed companies. Measures of board of directors employed are size of the board, presence of non-executive directors on the board, presence of independent non-executive directors on the board and CEO/Chair duality. Results reveal that board size and presence of independent non-executive directors on the board have significant, negatively and positively correlation with debt to asset ratio respectively. However corporate capital structure decisions are not found significantly influenced by CEO/Chair duality and the presence of non-executive directors on the board. Consequently based on the results, board of director's features such as board size and presence of independent non-executive directors on the board play an important role in determination of financial mix of the companies.

Over the last ten years, the corporate governance context in most Western countries has changed as a result of irregularities, increased regulation, heightened societal expectations and shareholder activism. This paper examines the impact of the changing context on the role of chairmen of supervisory boards in the Netherlands. Based on a combination of thirty semi-structured interviews with board members of leading Dutch corporations and secondary data on the position of supervisory board chairmen at the top-100 listed firms in the Netherlands, the study reveals that board chairmen have become increasingly involved in both their control and service roles. While the demographics (i. e., age, tenure, gender and nationality) of chairmen have hardly changed over the last decade, chairmen are spending considerably more time on boards and committees, have reduced the number of board interlocks and have become more active on the forefront of the corporate governance discussion. The paper highlights several implications for scholars and practitioners. (c) 2010 The Author(s).

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

This study offers to regulators and practitioners evidence on the role of the board of directors' composition in the financial distress of family businesses in an emerging economy such as Lebanon. The paper examines the role of outside directors, insiders' equity ownership, and CEO-board chair duality on the financial distress of non-listed family-owned firms. Between the periods of 2007-2010, the authors investigate 276 firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group, using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance. Empirical results based on a longitudinal sample indicate that (1) the presence of outside directors on the board of directors has no effect on financial distress; and (2) insiders' equity ownership reduceod of financial distress; whereas, (3) the CEO-board chair duality increases the probability of financial distress of Lebanese family businesses. The findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators towards a selective implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance of one of the pillar of the Lebanese economy. The replacement of an inside director by an outsider will not increase the chance of survival of familyowned firms. In contrast, equity ownership held by insiders and the separation of the CEO-Chairperson position can be used as a tool to reduce agency costs, and as a result, enhance the financial performance.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper is an attempt to answer this research question. The empirical study focuses on the SBF 120 companies and over the period 2007-2008.The results show that the decision to implement social and environmental verifi cation is infl uenced by internal governance : capital dilution, employee shareholders, size and independence of the Board, presence of a CSR committee. Besides these factors, the decision also depends on industry. (c) Association Francophone de Comptabilite. Tous droits reserves pour tous pays.

The need to intensify the corporate governance mechanism in the Philippines triggers this study to determine the influence of corporate boards on firm performance among publicly-listed property companies given the risks involved in this industry. Using financial and governancerelated disclosure information from 29 listed property companies in the Philippines, the results revealed that managerial ownership positively influences firm performance. Moreover, firm size, leverage, and age influence the accounting-based measures of performance to a great extent than the market-based measures. Because of the limited focus of this study, further research should focus on the overall impact of corporate governance among all Philippine companies using different measures of performance as well as the introduction of other relevant governancerelated parameters to better assist the decision making of the company's stakeholders.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

This paper examines the impact of board of directors (BOD) on corporate performance in value addition efficiency (VAE) of resources in an emerging economy namely Thailand in the context of post Asian financial crisis 1997/1998 period. This research uses data of top, as per market capitalisation, listed companies in Thailand for 2005 and 2008 to test the relationship. The study measures VAE of resources using Pulic's value added intellectual coefficient (VAICTM) model. The results find the impact of different BOD attributes on VAE of resources in top Thai companies, which is increasing over the post Asian crisis period. However, the study do not find significant impact of all BOD attributes on VAE which indicates the juvenile state of the BOD's effectiveness in achieving sustainable corporate performance. Managers and the policy makers may use the results to understand the complicated magnitude of BOD governance and its effectiveness in top companies in emerging economy, which might have the implication in developing more effective corporate governance structure in order to tackle the adverse effects of any further financial crisis.

Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

The Board of Directors plays a key role as a internal mechanism of corporate governance. Indeed, its effectiveness is dependent on the presence of several factors, the most important are related to characteristics that relate primarily to the independence of its members, board size, the cumulative functions of decision and control, the degree of independence of the audit committee and the gender diversity of the board. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board's characteristics and financial performance measured by three different ratios, namely ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we have developed three linear regression models. Our empirical validation was conducted on a sample of 26 companies listed on the Tunisian stock exchange Tunis (Tunis Stock Exchange) over a period that spans four years (2007-2010). The estimated models show satisfactory results showing the importance of the impact of board characteristics on financial performance of Tunisian companies.

This study attempts to investigate the link between corporate governance mechanisms and audit report lag for companies listed on Bursa Malaysia from 2007 to 2009. The 288 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have been randomly selected. The corporate governance mechanisms examined include the board of directors and audit committee. It shows that there are significant negative relationships between board diligence, audit committee independence and expertise. The higher the number of meetings being held indicates that the board is discharging their role towards the company. The results show that audit committee independence and audit committee expertise could assist in reducing audit report lag among companies in Malaysia. Its provide some evidence supporting the resource based theory, whereby characteristics of the audit committee, such as the resources and capabilities, could improve companies' performance as well as corporate reporting.However, it could not provide any evidence concerning the link between board independence, board expertise, CEO duality and audit committee diligence on audit report lag. This study provides comprehensive examination of ARL on Malaysian listed companies for three years period. It is consider the initial study to provide a thorough examination of the association between corporate governance characteristics and ARL.

Our work provides an analysis of the interaction effects between internal governance mechanisms on the components of initial returns during the listing period. The application of multivariate regressions on a sample of 110 IPO French companies during 2005-2010, has allowed us to conclude that the different interactions between these mechanisms significantly influence the level of under / overpricing. Indeed, the positive relationship between internal governance mechanisms and overpricing reflects a substitutability relationship. In contrast, the complementarity effect comes from the negative relationship characterizing the combination of governance mechanisms and the underpricing. Thus, the interactions effects between institutional ownership, board structure and under / overpricing are not conforming to the existence of a complementarity or substitutability relationship between these variables given the absence of a significant combination between these variables.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Dilek Demirbas, Andrey Yukhanaev and Roman Stepanov 22.1 INTRODUCTION All organizations around the world, regardless of either Western or Eastern origin, are currently undergoing significant changes. One of the major changes within these organizations is corporate governance, and these changes in corporate governance have become the focus of all related parties such as directors, investors, stakeholders and regulators. Indeed, Tricker (2000), considering the evolution of business environment and corporate development, postulated the following chronology: entrepreneurship as a nineteenth-century phenomenum, management prevalence as a catalytic force in the twentieth century and corporate governance as a leitmotif of modern times. The common conclusion of all parties involved is that companies across the world need to adopt commonly accepted corporate governance standards in order to attract foreign capital, to become internationally more competitive and to deal with corporate governance problems in today's economic environment. With the intention of providing the best and most commonly accepted international corporate governance standards, in 1999 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed an international corporate governance code and global principles of 'good' governance. In 2004, the OECD revised its previous attempt, Principles of Corporate Governance and defined 'good corporate governance'. Since the date of first publication, the OECD Principles (1999, 2004) have gained substantial recognition worldwide as a framework for reforms and a reference point for corporate governance literature. Now, there is a positive tendency among company directors around the world to support reforms, partly as a result of increasing international pressures to harmonize corporate....

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Although the composition of the board of directors has important implications for different aspects of firm performance, prior studies tend to focus on financial performance. The effects of board composition on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance remain an under-researched area, particularly in the period following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). This article specifically examines two important aspects of board composition (i.e., the presence of outside directors and the presence of women directors) and their relationship with CSR performance in the Post-SOX era. With data covering over 500 of the largest companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and spanning 64 different industries, we find empirical evidence showing that greater presence of outside and women directors is linked to better CSR performance within a firm's industry. Treating CSR performance as the reflection of a firm's moral legitimacy, our study suggests that deliberate structuring of corporate boards may be an effective approach to enhance a firm's moral legitimacy.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

This study asserts that the effects of board characteristics on firm innovation need to be evaluated with reference to contingency variables. A literature review suggests that relatively few studies adopt a contingency view when examining the outcomes of boards of directors. This study examines the influence on firm innovation of characteristics such as board size, outsider ratio and board diversity, and suggests that their influence is contingent upon firm size. The model is tested on a sample of Italian companies and finds support for the contingency hypothesis. This study advances research on boards of directors by emphasizing the importance of context.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore how the combinations of firm-level corporate governance (CG) practices embedded in different national governance systems lead to high firm performance. Research Findings/Insights: Using fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis, we uncover a variety of findings. First, we show that within each of the stylized national CG models, there are multiple bundles of firm-level governance practices leading to high firm performance (i.e., equifinality). Second, we provide evidence of complementarity as well as functional equivalence between CG practices. Finally, we demonstrate that there can be heterogeneity ("differences in kind") in firm governance practices within each stylized model of CG. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the configurational and complementarity-based approaches to make the following theoretical claims. First, governance practices within firm bundles do not always relate to each other in a monotonic and cumulative fashion as this entails higher costs and possibly over-governance. Second, practices in bundles do not need to be aligned toward the insider or the outsider model ("similar in kind"). We argue that non-aligned practices can also be complementary, creating hybrid governance forms. Third, we predict functional equivalence across bundles of CG practices which grants firms agency on which of the practices to implement in order to achieve high performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We contribute to comparative CG research by demonstrating that there are multiple governance paths leading to high firm performance, and that these practices do not always belong to the same national governance tradition. Therefore, our findings alert of the perils of "one size fits all" governance solutions when designing and implementing CG policies. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate board size and promoter ownership on firm value for selected Indian companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyses the corporate governance structure of 176 Indian firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange using linear regression analysis. Findings: The empirical findings show a negative relationship of board size with firm value and significant positive association of promoter ownership with corporate performance. The study suggests that only above a critical ownership level of 40 percent does promoter's interest become aligned with that of the company, resulting in positive effect on firm value. Research limitations/ implications: The research has been limited to some selected Indian companies, with focus only on board size and promoter ownership as predictor variables. The study suggests that corporate governance reforms in India and introduction of non-executive independent directors to the board have resulted in diminishing effect of board size on the firm value. Practical implications: The study implies that for emerging economies like India, it is practical to have greater ownership control by promoters to enhance company value. Also, it is not advisable to have a board size above certain limit. Originality/value: The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size and promoter ownership.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The article is concerned with the prevalence, character, and development of qualitative research within the field of corporate governance. The paper provides an overview of published qualitative research in the field of corporate governance based on a structured literature search of papers published in scholarly peer-reviewed journals between 1986 and 2011. Research Findings/Insights: A fine-grained search based on key words resulted in a sample of 78 qualitative corporate governance studies. A review and content analysis of these studies show that qualitative studies in governance have grown in number since the 1990s, but remain a small fraction of the published work on corporate governance. Studies are mostly developed by UK and European scholars, published in European journals and tend to explore boards of directors more than other governance related actors and mechanisms. These studies utilize a range of disciplines, predominantly management, adopting a wide range of methods, the most prevalent being that of the interview, often in combination with other methods to get a better account of the empirical phenomenon. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The search reveals an eclectic range of theories, spanning several disciplines, which is serving to generate, elaborate, and refine theorizing about corporate governance and the associated meanings, mechanisms, processes and relationships. There is much scope and need for more qualitative studies of significant rigor and relevance which explore the array of interactions and processes involved in corporate governance, across different levels of analysis and contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications: After over two decades of research and reform of corporate governance, problems of practice remain, and corporate governance prescription via codes and other forms of regulation is increasing in search of better governance. Qualitative research can assist policy-makers and practitioners to develop more efficient governance mechanisms, by shedding light on the efficacy of policy prescription. Qualitative research provides a basis for rethinking and challenging some of the dominant assumptions and meanings about how governance actors and institutions actually function.

This paper explores the phenomenon of positive organizational deviance from institutional norms by establishing practices that protect or enhance the natural environment. Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors-the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A focus on preserving socioemotional wealth may influence entrepreneurial activities in family firms. In this paper, we identify the emotion of empathy in the family CEO as an antecedent of socioemotional wealth creation. We argue that the presence of one or more external directors can have a direct as well as moderating influence on the relationship between CEO's empathy and the salience of socioemotional wealth to the family CEO. Our empirical tests confirm these hypotheses. Several areas of future research are suggested to incorporate empathy and other emotions in family business studies.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Despite growing interest in the board of directors of entrepreneurial firms, the role of outside board members in high tech start-ups has been largely neglected. This dearth of research is surprising since the high level of resource dependency these ventures face is likely to heighten the potential contribution outside board members can make. We argue that, for high tech start-ups, the service role the board plays will be crucial in overcoming resource dependencies. In contrast to existing studies that tie the outside boards' servicing role to board characteristics, we propose that greater attention needs to be paid to the resource profile of the venture. Building on resource dependency theory, we find that the extent to which the outside board members fulfil a service role is dependent on the initial human, financial and technological resource base of the entrepreneurial venture. Specifically, we find that ventures with less diversified teams, teams with lower levels of R&D experience and higher levels of financial experience and ventures earlier in the technological development process receive higher levels of support from the outside board.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study aims to examine the relationship between board composition (i.e. nonexecutive directors, family directors, role duality and board size) and bank performance, using a sample of nine listed Kuwait banks over the 2006 to 2010 period. The study uses ordinary least squares (OLS) and twostageleast squares (2SLS) to test such a relationship and to address endogeneity in explanatory variables. The results provide some evidence that board composition of banks relates to their performance. According to the OLS regression results, only board size and proportion of nonexecutive directors negatively affect bank performance. Meanwhile, the 2SLS results indicate that role duality positively affects a bank's performance while board size affects a bank's performance negatively. Although the model has explained a significant part of the variation in performance, still unexplained is a material part that represents the "noise" of the model. Data availability limited the ability to study other aspects of corporate governance mechanisms such as number of audit committee members on board. The sample size is small; thus, in future research, the sample size could be increased by including a longer period of time or different countries such as members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia). Given the importance of effective boards in monitoring bank values, more actions and rules need to take place in Kuwait to improve the efficacy of boards in protecting shareholders and their interests in Kuwaiti banks. Regulators may mandate a corporate governance code or adopt the OECD corporate governance principles as a starting point in Kuwait. Kuwaiti companies may use the findings to make appropriate choices about board appointments and best governance to improve performance. Investors also may use the findings to understand Kuwaiti companies. Such findings may assist them to diversify their investment portfolios. This study asserts to provide insights on the relationship between bank performance and board composition in Kuwait. The study extends prior research and investigates the roles of board of directors in banks in the context of an emerging market characterized by weak shareholder protection and highly concentrated ownership.

This study investigated how female directors of corporate boards of directors (BoD) experience boardroom dynamics. The study represents an initial research trend that moves from a unilateral focus on financial outcomes of female representation in BoDs toward stronger attention on the social dynamics in the boardroom. Drawing on social identity theory, the study proposed that female directors often constitute an out-group within the BoD, preventing them from experiencing positive board dynamics. More specifically, the study explored the extent to which female directors do experience less justice, lower cohesion, and higher levels of conflicts within the BoD than their male counterparts do. Moreover, we assumed that female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds would be particularly likely to experience negative boardroom dynamics whereas female chairpersons of BoDs would perceive boardroom dynamics more positively than other female directors. The sample consisted of 491 directors from 149 BoDs. Our findings revealed that there were generally few differences in the way female and male directors experienced boardroom dynamics and female chairpersons of BoDs did not perceive the dynamics differently than other female directors. Female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds perceived the boardroom dynamics somewhat more negatively than other female directors, but the differences were not statistically significant. The conclusions from this study are that there are reasons to believe that female directors are welcomed into boardrooms, not perceived as out-groups, and BoDs are able to benefit from the female directors' experience and skills.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

The goal of this article is to examine the influence of the board of directors in constraining earnings management in private family firms. We build further on the premise that corporate governance is conditional in nature. Specifically, we propose that the effect of the proportion of outside directors and CEO duality on earnings management is stronger when the family firm faces significant agency problems. Our results find support for the fact that, conditional on the presence of agency conflicts between controlling and noncontrolling shareholders, a higher proportion of outside directors and CEO nonduality may have a constraining effect on earnings management. This is in support of our argument that the relationship between board characteristics and earnings management is moderated by the potential presence of agency conflicts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance on the performance of 37 commercial banks in Kenya over the period 2005-2009. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two measures of performance, i.e. return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), and the dependent variables and three measures of governance - namely the board size, independent directors, and CEO duality - as the key independent variables. The study follows a panel econometrics technique to investigate the relationship between governance variables and bank performance. Findings: The main findings are as follows: a large board size tends to impact performance negatively; the existence of independent board directors tends to enhance the performance of the banks; and there is no evidence that CEO duality or otherwise has impact on the performance of commercial banks in Kenya. Practical implications: The study therefore recommends that for commercial banks in Kenya to register high performance they need to check the size of their board of directors and also increase the number of independent directors. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study on Kenya that has used advanced panel data techniques. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

The objective of this paper is to determine the managerial governance characteristics related to financial distress companies. The boards failed to accomplish their monitoring duties, which seemed to be one of the main reasons behind the actual financial distress and bankruptcy that swept the companies across the planet. Through the analysis of a sample of 178 Lebanese non listed and owned family firms, the results showed that the boards (that have a higher proportion of outside directors) are less inclined to face a financial distress than the boards with a lower proportion. Besides, a different conclusion proves that the board's size and financial distress are directly linked. The paper highlights the extent to which financial distress is associated with corporate governance from a Euro Mediterranean country. It would be a source of education to Lebanese investors who excessively go for short-term returns and of help for regulatory authorities in the framework of making policies on corporate governance reformation.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

This article examines how ownership, management and governance characteristics and the associated agency problems of family firms impact the divestment decision. Based on the divestment activity of 48 listed family firms in Belgium over a six-year period, I find an inverse U-shaped relationship between family ownership and divestment likelihood, supporting the alignment view at medium levels of family ownership but entrenchment at high ownership levels. In addition to ownership, the governance of the family firm also impacts the divestment decision. Divestiture likelihood is significantly lower when the family exerts its influence through the board of directors, consistent with the entrenchment view that they will use their influence to pursue non-economic goals. Founders, on the other hand, act as active monitors of the firm's activities and do not seem to be hindered by emotional considerations which result in more divestment activity as compared to other family firms.

Since the beginnings of the global debate over corporate governance in the early 1990s, academics, practitioners and policymakers have focused on changing boards of directors to improve corporate governance. The financial crisis of 2007-09 arose despite two decades of codification of corporation governance, a process that continues in the light of concern about corporate performance and accountability: codes have not eliminated the problems they set out to address. Analysing the three main versions of the UK code of corporate governance, we see a shifting discourse of 'structures' in Cadbury to 'independence' under the reforms in 2003, and then in the 2010 iteration towards 'behaviour', as the code seeks to improve boards as mechanisms of corporate governance. The evolution in the language and recommendations of the code reveals growing understanding both of the practical challenge of board effectiveness and of the limitations to codification.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

Purpose: This study aims to look at how corporate governance, specifically internal mechanisms of corporate governance, affects the value relevance of reported accounting earnings of listed firms on the Ghana Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The study used the Ohlson valuation model with a panel dataset, employing pooled regression analysis with random effects. Findings: The findings indicate that net asset value per share is value relevant on the Ghanaian market, and even more so when the board size is small or the CEO also doubles as the board chair. Board independence as captured by the percentage of non-executive directors on the board is relatively irrelevant in the market valuation of shares, and when relevant has a negative effect. Originality/value: The value relevance of accounting information on the Ghanaian financial market, by implication, requires that the necessary rules and supervision regarding financial reporting must be provided to ensure that the information that reaches the investing public is therefore a true reflection of the underlying economic value of firms, so that capital allocation decisions based on these sources will be efficient.

The literature and many national regulatory frameworks have underlined the importance of audit committees as monitoring mechanisms. In the prevailing Italian firms' corporate governance system, there is no audit committee. Instead, its functions are responsibility of two different committees. One is the Internal Control Committee and the other the Board of Statutory Auditors. In this article, we try to understand whether the determinants of Audit Committee diligence, analyzed by the literature, affect both Internal Control Committee and Board of Statutory Auditor diligence in the firms listed on the Italian stock exchange over a three-year period (2005-2007).Regression analysis results show a lack of relation between Internal Control Committee diligence and the percentage of outsiders in the board, the percentage of independent directors in the board, CEO duality, and presence of blockholders. The results show that the board of director diligence has a positive effect on Internal Control Committee diligence. With regard to Board of Statutory Auditors, data show a lack of relation between its diligence and the percentage of outside directors in the board, CEO duality, and presence of blockholders. Data show a positive and significant relation between Board of Statutory Auditor diligence and both percentage of independent directors in the board and diligence of board of directors.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

The board of directors plays a key role as an internal mechanism of corporate governance. Indeed, its effectiveness is dependent on the presence of several factors, the most important are related to characteristics that relate primarily to the independence of its members, board size, the cumulative functions of decision and control, the degree of independence of the audit committee and the gender diversity of the board. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board's characteristics and financial performance measured by three different ratios, namely ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we have developed three linear regression models. Our empirical validation was conducted on a sample of 26 companies listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over a period that spans four years (2007-2010). The estimated models show satisfactory results showing the importance of the impact of board characteristics on financial performance of Tunisian companies. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: If proficient boards result in better governance, as the literature on the subject generally suggests, engaging independent directors and having in place an effective audit committee would certainly facilitate productive corporate functioning and enhanced accountability. Motivated by such a viewpoint, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the reporting quality and performance of the Indian central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and its private counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The well premeditated propositions of the study resulted in a final sample comprising 47 CPSEs and 30 peer companies. The auditors' report on financial statements was scanned to determine the quality of company's accounting and financial reporting systems. The BSE-500 Index companies were ranked on select financial parameters to gauge relative performance of the sample companies. Findings: An analysis of the CPSEs shows that non-compliance with the corporate governance provisions with regards to the required number of independent directors on the board did not have any concomitant effect on their performance. Further, an examination of auditors' report revealed that the CPSEs provide a better insight into books of accounts, unlike the private sector. Originality/value: The study is timely and relevant, given the expanded role of the state and renewed interest in boards. A case for collaborative engagement between the government and the corporate sector is proposed to address legal as well as regulatory lacunae for building trust and fostering good corporate governance. To ensure better compliance and enforcement of financial regulations it envisions an integrated accounting/auditing and taxation administration platform. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Ethical issues have received growing attention recently, after corporate scandals and during the current economic crisis. Several initiatives have been adopted to restore confidence and trust in businesses, such as ethics codes. In addition, as a result of those scandals and financial frauds, several rules have focused on the role played by Boards of Directors in the planning and monitoring of codes of ethics. However, the empirical evidence is still scarce and needs some degree of extension. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of several corporate governance features-particularly, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-on the decision of developing an ethics code, among Spanish companies. Our main findings point out the lack of influence of the CEO's characteristics (except for CEO reputation) on the likelihood of having a corporate code, indicating that this decision has to do with a choice made by the company overall, perhaps because of regulatory reasons or stakeholders' expectations. Also, we have checked how other variables, such as the extent of a firm's participation in defence or other government contracts or multiple listings of the company in different financial markets, can influence the decision of developing an ethics code.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This study investigates the success factors that can influence the performance and the continuity of the French and Lebanese family firms. Based on the literature review, the performance of the family firms was found to be linked to effective success keys like the succession planning, networking strategy, financial structure, management practices and finally the governance structure. Effectively, the results of this study indicate that French family firms are linked to four success keys (Planning for Succession, Using of Emotional intelligence, Professional HR management and Long Term Overview) while the Lebanese family firms are linked to five success keys (Financial structure with low leverage, Planning for Succession, Using of Emotional intelligence, professional HR management and Governmental Networking). Due to the non-significant impact of governance structure, an advanced investigation has been applied to detect the impact of this variable on the performance of family firm. The results of this advanced study indicate a negative correlation between the performance of family firms and the board of directors' size. Moreover, a positive correlation has been found between family firm performance and the presence of the outsiders in the board of directors.

This study focuses on the role of the corporate board of directors and the relationship between the dynamics of board structure and the financial performance of listed South African companies. The research results found that the proportion of independent non-executive directors had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share and enterprise value, but had no significant effect on Tobin's Q ratio. Board ownership had a significant negative correlation with firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The number of directors serving on the corporate board had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The study suggests that greater independent non-executive director representation, lower board share-ownership and larger board sizes should be encouraged to enhance firm performance.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

This study seeks to trace dimensions through which corporate governance characteristics influence the financial performance of family owned businesses. Between the periods of 2009-2011, we examined 160 Lebanese family owned firms that were equally divided between a control and an experimental group. Using a multiple logistic regression between a proxy ratio of financial distress and three exogenous variables of corporate governance, we found evidence of the attribute of boards' composition to firm's failure; the presence of outside directors seemed to have no role in the financial distress and insider ownership decrease the likelihood of financial distress but CEO duality increases the same probability of family owned firms in Lebanon. Our findings may well urge Lebanese investors and regulators toward the implementation of governance practices, to enhance the performance in one of the pillars of every local economy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Banks are in the business of taking risks. The 3 pillars of Basel II capital accord highlight the crucial role of informative risk disclosures in enhancing market discipline. The specific role and responsibilities of the board of directors or supervisory boards in banking institutions continue, however, to fuel debate. Findings of the literature are often inconclusive. The main contribution of this study is examining how board characteristics affect risk in banking industry. We explore this relationship by using many econometric approaches. The empirical analysis based on a sample of 11 Tunisian conventional banks over the period 2001-2011 reports the following results when using GLS RE: small and dual functions boards are associated with more insolvency risk but have no significant effect on credit and global risks. The presence of independent directors within the board generates an increase in global risk but has no significant effect on insolvency and credit risks. A lower CEO ownership has no significant effect with all measures of risks. Finally, banking capitalization is associated with more insolvency risk, and small size banks assume lower credit risk. These findings are performed by using a GMM in system approach.

The recent systemic crisis that has affected the financial markets and real economies of major industrialized countries has had significant effects on the corporate governance and key organizational choices of large firms. In this context, the present study aims to verify whether the international crisis has significantly changed the structure of the interlocking directorate network that links large firms in the regulated Italian market. To this end, the first part of the paper presents an analysis of the evolution of corporate governance in the main European regulated markets through a comparative analysis of some synthetic statistical data observed at the end of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010. In the second part, after framing the concept of interlocking directorate in a theoretical perspective, we examine the evolution of the network of personal ties between large Italian listed companies in the period of observation (2006-2010) using Social Network Analysis.

This paper examines the relation between corporate governance mechanisms and earnings management. Using data collected from New Zealand listed companies for the financial year ending in 2005, the results show that the size of the board of directors is significantly positively associated with earnings management. This suggests that larger boards seem to be ineffective in their oversight duties relative to smaller boards. On the other hand, the independence of the board of directors, the independent role of the board chair and chief executive officer, and the independence of audit committees are not significantly associated with earnings management. Thus, these three corporate governance mechanisms are ineffective at monitoring the discretionary choices of management. The lack of effective corporate governance in New Zealand, particularly with regard to boards of directors, is mainly due to the lack of "experience and skills required to oversee the scale, complexity, and characteristics of finance operations" (Ministry of Economic Development, 2009, p.8).

In this study, we investigated the impact of academicians as board members on firm outcomes. Based on popular theories of corporate governance, we contend that firms with academicians as directors would have more vigilance on their boards, would perform better based on accounting measures, and would be perceived as more valuable based on a market measure. Using a matched-pair design, our results showed that firms with academician directors do not have more vigilance on their boards and do not differ based on their accounting performance. However, they are perceived to be more valuable, which signifies the possible positive impact of academicians on one of the organizational outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) The Authors 2013.

The interplay of the Top Management Team (TMT), Board of Directors (BOD) and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in strategy-making in Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) has been long debated. Some experts argue the BOD should take a strong role in strategy-making while the alternative point of view is that the CEO is the key man or woman. In a qualitative study with SMEs operating in Malaysia, the TMT is found to be the key player in strategic decision-making. The findings identify how the TMT, BOD and the CEO can combine to add value to the organization in particular how these organization members can team up and interact to achieve a faster, more flexible strategy cycle. The SMEs focus needs to be on giving more emphasis to the empowerment, interaction and creativity of the BOD, CEO and TMT. The TMT should focus on questioning, criticizing, refining and enabling the strategy proposed by the professional managers. However, the study indicates these findings are subject to exception and variation in relation to factors including specialist knowledge, track record of performance, personality attributes, personal power and political and influencing skills. The major focus of attention of the TMT, BOD and CEO is the strategic-thinking related activities in strategy-making. (c) Medwell Journals, 2013.

Businesses commonly access new markets through joint ventures, and these partnerships may adopt diverse structures of government, among which the Board of Directors often plays a key role. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to observe which characteristics of the Board most affect the success of joint ventures between Spanish and Moroccan SMEs, operating in Morocco. Using a structured questionnaire, we analyse the characteristics of the Board that affect success, as measured by the partners' satisfaction with the performance achieved. The results show that factors influencing overall partners' satisfaction with the joint venture include the existence of external directors, the existence of directors with a significant level of ownership in the partnership, the existence of an audit committee, and the (low) frequency of Board meetings. All these measures can be said to be indicators of the type of control held over the partnership, as a means of ensuring the partners' goals are achieved.

Cooperatives are expected to help generate economic growth; become competitive business entities; remain as effective self-help organizations and uphold sensitivity towards the environment. However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth, 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, 'horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We combine the value-creation and value-protection views of the board of directors to study the impact of board independence (BI) on the value of the firm at the time of its initial public offering (IPO). Research Findings/Insights: We conduct our analysis on a sample of 969 firms that went public in France, Germany, and Italy between 1995 and 2011. We show that BI is a critical factor in the valuation of IPO firms. Our results support both the value-creation and value-protection roles of the board of directors. The relative importance of the two roles of the board varies over time, with value-creation (value-protection) dominating in IPOs of young (mature) companies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our theoretical framework combines the agency and resource-dependence theories. The impact of BI on IPO valuation depends on the importance of the value-creation and value-protection roles played by the board. The change in the relative importance of the two roles determines a U-shaped relationship between BI and firm age. Corporate governance is particularly important for young and innovative firms (where the resource-dependence theory applies, and governance acts as a value-creation device), as well as for mature firms and for companies where ownership and control are separated (where the agency theory applies, and governance serves as a value-protection mechanism for minority shareholders). Practitioner/Policy Implications: We show that corporate governance is a significant factor affecting the valuation of an IPO company. The importance of BI varies substantially with the knowledge intensity of the industry, the separation between ownership and control, and the age of the listing company.

We propose a concept of structural equality as a compromise between competing policy preferences of equality and individual liberty to address a stunning property of the governance of corporations, namely, the paucity of female directors on corporate boards. An argument for imposing a quota for women directors on boards is the need to disrupt structural impediments to permit endogenous mechanisms to sustain female recruitment beyond a critical mass. Using estimates from the Norwegian experiment, we apply an agent-based model to American board data to show that modest numerical quotas generate well-connected networks of women directors who attain equality in their centrality and influence. The analysis demonstrates the utility of computational social science for identifying policies that generate alternative and possible worlds of greater structural equality.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the relationship between internal governance structure and financial performance of listed Spanish companies. The effectiveness of the board of directors is analyzed through the use of different variables: size, composition, duality, number of annual meetings and busyness of the directors. The financial performance is measured by return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q. Design/methodology/approach - Our study is addressed through the use of a multi-theoretical approach followed by an empirical analysis. Schematic literature review serves as a basis for setting our hypotheses. We conduct the empirical part of the study by applying these to the listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange. An econometric model (multiple regression) is used to test the relation between board structure and financial performance. Findings - Empirical: We conclude that in the three estimated models, two of the dependent variables, ROE and ROA, have an explanatory value. The relationship between the number of the boards of directors' meetings and performance has proved to be negative. Theoretical: Ample literature on corporate governance leads to two conclusions: First, corporative-financial relations must be studied by a multi-theoretical approach. Second, future research must be made only on specific studies coincident with the majority of their characteristics (country, type of firm, type of statistical model [...]). Research limitations/implications - Future research will try to cover gaps, expanding this study in both space and time. Practical implications - The number of Spanish companies' boards meetings is very high. As shown in our study, holding more than one meeting a month does not guarantee greater financial returns; the board can effectively establish its strategic lines of business by meeting up to 12 times per year. Social implications - The results show a negative relationship between ROE and the number of meetings, which may be linked to the country's business culture, which traditionally has a higher number of annual meetings when compared to neighboring countries. Perhaps, this is an indicative symptom of the inefficiency associated with the Spanish system. Originality/value - Theoretical review is performed with two aims: first, to establish our research hypotheses, and second, to reflect on future research by fine-tuning the abundant previous studies.

This study explored the role of the board of directors in the relationship between integrated risk management and product innovation. We focused on a board's direct involvement in risk oversight and its use of external audit in risk oversight, and examined their moderating effects on the relationship between integrated risk management and product innovation. Panel data from a survey of 1178 Chinese firms was analyzed to test the hypotheses. A board's direct involvement in risk oversight was found to negatively moderate the positive relationship between integrated risk management and product innovation success. The use of external audit in risk oversight similarly weakens the relationship. These results show how an effective board contributes to the innovation benefits associated with risk management in product innovation. They also have important implications for emerging economy firms pursuing an integrated approach to risk management in product innovation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The last two decades have witnessed substantial scholarly interest in corporate boards, yet little research has been devoted to boards of international joint ventures (IJVs). We combine the corporate governance and alliance governance literatures in order to study this important ex post governance mechanism for IJVs. We identify a fundamental tension inherent in IJVs, which arises from the unique features of this organizational form and influences the level of involvement by their boards. International joint ventures are hybrid organizational forms that can require administrative control to facilitate monitoring and coordinated adaptation in the presence of exchange hazards. At the same time, the fact that IJVs operate in different host countries can make it efficient to delegate authority to local management for certain collaborations. In investigating the determinants of IJV board involvement, we therefore examine characteristics of IJVs that reflect this underlying tension. We conclude that board involvement reflects efficiency considerations in individual ventures, and the administrative control provided by boards is an important dimension of IJV governance.

We examine the relationship between strategic change and CEO compensation by studying how a firm's refocusing program influences CEO compensation after completing the change. We contribute to the 'settling up' literature by arguing that strategic change is often uncertain for both the CEO and the board of directors responsible for executive compensation. As such the firm is likely to settle up with the CEO by paying for compensation risk and effort undertaken during refocusing after the extent and impact of strategic change are better known. We find that refocusing intensity is positively related to post-refocusing CEO total compensation, suggesting that 'settling up' through post hoc compensation is an important factor in strategic change. We also find that prior firm performance, governance structure and industry dynamism are important moderators of this relationship. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study investigates the effects of the separation of control and ownership on the value of cash holdings in publicly listed French firms. It also sheds light on the role of board independence in such a relation. Theory suggests that investors are more likely to discount the value of excess cash held by firms with low corporate governance. Using the valuation regression of Fama and French (1998), empirical results show that the value of excess cash holdings decreases dramatically with the separation of control and cash-flow rights of the controlling shareholder. This value discount is, however, less pronounced in firms with more independent boards (i.e., boards with more independent directors and separate chief executive officer and chair positions). Our empirical findings support the argument that excess cash contributes less to firm value when minority shareholders are more likely to be expropriated by controlling shareholders. Independent boards seem to be effective in mitigating investors' concerns about the use of excess cash. Overall, the results provide compelling evidence that cash valuation is largely influenced by corporate governance quality in a concentrated ownership setting. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Purpose: This study aims to open up the black box of the boardroom by directly observing directors' interactions during meetings to better understand board processes.
Design/methodology/approach: We analyze videotaped observations of board meetings at two Australian companies to develop insights into what directors do in meetings and how they participate in decision-making processes. The direct observations are triangulated with semi-structured interviews, mini-surveys and document reviews.
Findings: Our analyses lead to two key fndings: while board meetings appear similar at a surface level, boardroom interactions vary significantly at a deeper level (i.e. board members participate differently during different stages of discussions), and factors at multiple levels of analysis explain differences in interaction patterns, revealing the complex and nested nature of boardroom discussions.
Research implications: Bydocumenting significant intra- and inter-board meeting differences, our study challenges the widespread notion of board meetings as rather homogeneous and monolithic, points towards agenda items as a new unit of analysis and highlights the need for more multi-level analyses in a board setting.
Practical implications: While policymakers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, our findings suggest that decision outcomes or roles' execution could be potentially affected by interactions at a board level. Differences in board meeting styles might explain prior ambiguous board structure-performance results, enhancing the need for greater normative consideration of how boards do their work.
Originality/value: This study complements existing research on boardroom dynamics and provides a systematic account of director interactions during board meetings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Purpose: This study seeks to explore how non-executive directors address governance problems on Dutch two-tier boards. Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address due to the formal separation of management boards' decision-management from supervisory boards' decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of two-tier boards in The Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and the management of the relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom. Originality/value: Whereas most studies have focussed on regulatory initiatives to improve the functioning of boards (e.g. the independence of the board), this study explores how non-executive directors attempt to enhance the effectiveness of boards on which they serve.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study examines how chief executive officer (CEO) compensation decisions may be influenced by a major group decision-making tendency referred to as group polarization among outside directors. I start by explaining why outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation when they previously witnessed relatively high (low) CEO compensation across different boards. Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority's prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors' power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it. Longitudinal analyses (1995-2006) of Fortune 500 CEOs' compensation provide support for these theoretical predictions. This study contributes to corporate governance research on CEO compensation by advancing a novel group decision-making approach to examining this important decision. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Research on the composition of the board of directors of DMOs as well as the governance of DMOs is of particular interest for destination management, because it helps understand the context of community-type tourist destinations. There is an increasing body of research on the composition and roles of DMO boards of directors as well as the duties and tasks of those individuals. However, to date, no study has addressed their influence on the financial revenues of the organization. A DMO's budget is not God-given but evolves along with the development of the organizations and the institutions in the destinations. Thus, we investigate to what extent directors on the boards affect the amount from different revenue sources. Using data from 44 Swiss local and regional DMOs, we perform seven distinct multiple regressions with the following revenue sources as dependent variables: (1) membership fees, (2) partnership platforms/initiatives, (3) commercial revenues, (4) overnight taxes, (5) regional and state subsidies, (6) municipal subsidies, and (7) tourism taxes. Four independent variables (1) stakeholders, (2) public agents, (3) leaders, and (4) networkers, positively and negatively affect the revenue sources. The results reveal two contrasting roles: while leaders and networkers likely increase the revenue sources, stakeholder representatives and public agents negatively affect the revenue sources. Additionally, the latter two functions strongly increase the size of the DMOs' boards. We conclude with a new perspective on how to understand DMO boards, their functions, and finally the organizations themselves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This empirical study challenges the theory that a 'critical mass' of three or more women at the boardroom table is needed to make a difference. Performance ratings of Canadian publicly traded companies by the Globe and Mail show consistently higher corporate governance scores for companies with more women on their boards of directors. However, while companies that had three or more women on their boards had the highest scores, companies with only one woman on the board scored significantly higher than those with none. There was also no relationship between the number of women on boards of directors and Corporate Knights' social responsibility ratings on a national or global basis. The size of board and the type of industry are other important factors to consider when proposing quotas for female board members. (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

For the last two decades, board diversity is increasingly considered as a significant mechanism of good corporate governance. Thus, the question arises whether a heterogeneously or rather a homogenously composed board contributes to the efficiency of a company's management and monitoring. Especially national and international regulators and standard setters consider board diversity to be associated with an increasing firm performance. Therefore, the economic impact of board diversity aspects needs to be investigated empirically. This study examines the relationship between diversity within management boards and corporate performance for the German two-tier system by presenting a comprehensive literature analysis as well as an empirical analysis based on 149 publicly listed German organizations for the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Hence, management board diversity is characterized by attributes, such as gender, age, nationality and functionality. An analysis comparable to the one at hand including multiple dimensions for German companies has not been performed, yet. We mostly find negative effects of various board diversity characteristics on corporate performance, especially regarding age and national diversity. This may be due to the fact that great internationality on boards can decrease communication between board members and large age differences may alleviate decision-making processes.

In this article, we conduct a longitudinal study of women's progress on French corporate boards of directors. We particularly focus on the extent to which women directors have circumvented the glass ceiling. Using a sample of SBF 120 companies over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009, our results provide evidence of a significant increase in the number of women on French corporate boards. However, the corporate glass ceiling hypothesis is consistently rejected whatever the considered measure of female directors; i.e., the number of board seats held by women, the number of firms with a critical mass of female directors, and the number of directorships held by each women director.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the research in this field on the portrayal of women and the effect this has on boards and corporate image, as well as to propose a theoretical framework for further research on the effects of media stereotypes. The theoretical model aims to analyze the media's effect on female board members, and how this helps in the process of changing stereotypes or whether it consolidates existing preconceptions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the existing literature on the subject and proposes a theoretical model for future research, contributing thus in opening a new line of research in the field of the roles of women on boards. Findings: The conclusions reached will have important consequences for the future of women on boards in relation to three fundamental issues: the types of women that join boards of directors, the type of female profile companies search for and the roles women are expected to play on those boards. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institution to reflect on potential gender biases. Practical implications: The theoretical framework developed encourages corporate governance agents, business leaders and institutions and media agents to reflect on potential gender biases. Originality/value: An important body of literature already exists showing how the portrayal of women can reinforce or eliminate barriers to access membership of a board of directors. There is also a solid body of literature showing the media's effect on transmitting or changing preconceived ideas about women in business, as well as the potential impact of appointing them - through the influence of different stakeholders - on a company's image. However, there has been little substantial research carried out on the media's effect on gender diversity on boards. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study is an attempt to achieve the main objective by examining the association between the board of director's characteristics, audit committee characteristics and the executive committee characteristics and the performance of the Oman companies. This study used many assumptions to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable as discussed in the section explaining the study method. The data comprised of 162 non-financial companies because financial and non-financial companies employ different methods and they have different structures. As this study attempts to bridge the gap in the existing literature by investigating the association between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance in the emerging market of Oman, it focuses on adding new important variables of corporate governance mechanisms like board change, the role of secretary on the board, the legal counsel and the executive committee characteristics that improve firm performance. The findings indicated a significantly positive relationship between board size, board meeting, audit committee independence and executive committee independence, and the Tobin's Q. On the other hand, board independence and legal counsel are significantly and negatively related to Tobin's Q. Moreover, a positive but insignificant relationship is found between CEO tenure, CEO compensation, audit committee size, and the firm performance (Tobin's Q). Furthermore, board change, the role of the secretary on the board, audit committee meeting, executive committee size and executive committee meeting are revealed to have a negative but insignificant association with firm performance (Tobin's Q). Finally, this study provides recommendations for future research.

An initial public offering (IPO) represents one of the final stages in the life of a small firm as it transitions from private to public. In this paper the experience of directors is examined to determine the extent of the role they play in ensuring a successful listing. Unique data from 122 IPOs on the Swedish Stock Exchange have been examined in a search for the effect of director experience on aftermarket performance. Specific aspects of director experience within a board, such as interlocking directorships and average tenure, are connected to the underpricing of Swedish IPOs. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant relationship was found between long-run aftermarket performance and director experience at the time of an IPO. This suggests that the previous experience of directors, as measured in earlier studies, is less relevant to long-term aftermarket performance in Sweden compared to other countries studied in the literature review. This emphasises the importance of examining different institutional contexts. (c)2014 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

Purpose - This article aims to comment on how the empirical research on board effectiveness in crisis contexts has been evolving over time. Over the years, the empirical evidences have demonstrated that particular board features can improve the survival chances of firms suffering a crisis and, to date, experts agree that discussing these evidences is necessary for the further improvement of knowledge in this field.
Design/methodology/approach - This is a critical review article.
Findings - Valuable evidences emerge from the review. For example, it seems that board independence has a key role in enhancing the performance of firms suffering a crisis. At the same time, the review suggests that further refinement is needed for supporting (or eventually refuting) the idea that boards and/or Chief Executive Officers (1) must be replaced to achieve successful turnaround strategies.
Originality/value - On the basis of its findings, the review also prospects a number of conceptual and methodological implications for the future research and practice about board effectiveness in corporate crises. For example, these implications are associated with future investigations about the executives' sociodemographic features and personality traits as well. More international comparisons seem also needed to improve the reliability of the extant knowledge. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 139 articles on board leadership that were published in business and management journals since 1980s. Journal names, author country affiliations, topics and focus levels, theories, empirical contexts, and methodologies are presented and analysed. We also assemble and analyse this data thematically in order to identify and frame developments and trends in researchers' ideas on board leadership. This analysis provides guidance for researchers by identifying different research streams on board leadership. The analysis may also serve as basis for theory development in board leadership research that can inform policymaking and best practice recommendations.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the perceptions of accountants on corporate governance (CG) practices in public limited liability companies in Barbados, and the perceived effectiveness of these mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage approach was utilized. First, an Internet-based questionnaire was sent to members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Barbados to gain accounting perspectives on CG practices by listed Barbadian companies. Second, feedback on the survey results was obtained from the attendees of a panel session at a regional accounting conference. Third, interviews were conducted with five qualified accountants tofurther explore issues that emerged from the previous stages. Findings - The results suggest that the most important mechanisms for effective CG were the board of directors, auditors and professional accountants. The timely provision of relevant information, board room culture, qualifications and independence of directors were the tasks considered most vital to enhancing board effectiveness. However, the high concentration of ownership in family-controlled frms, interlocking directorates, weak regulatory systems and cultural issues influenced the effectiveness of CG mechanisms. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers and improving CG included purposive training, whistle-blowing mechanisms, stronger legislation and adequate disclosures. Research limitations/implications - The study's small sample increases the likelihood of bias and important differences being missed, thus reducing the generalizability to the accounting profession as a whole. Practical implications - The research sheds light on the value being placed on CG practices by the accounting profession. The study would assist companies, board of directors and accounting practitioners in developing CG mechanisms that are suitable for emerging countries. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the dearth of literature on perceptions of accountants on CG practices in emerging economies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2049-372X.

Agency theory is used to investigate the relationship between top management team involvement on not-for-profit hospitals' boards of directors (BODs) and hospital financial performance. Governance data collected in 2011 by The Governance Institute was merged with hospital financial performance data from the 2011 Medicare Cost Reports. Then, an ordinary least squares regression model, using propensity score adjustments, was used to evaluate the relationship between management involvement on the BOD and three financial performance profitability ratios: total margin, operating margin, and return on assets. The sample included 637 not-for-profit hospitals, most of which (74.1%) were not government owned. As hypothesized, we found that having a larger number of managers with voting rights on the BOD was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.011, p < .065). Similarly, we found that having a greater percentage of voting BOD members who were managers was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.296, p < .002) and return on assets (b= -0.337, p < .072). We did not find support for the notion that CEO involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance (b= -0.008, p < .437). Consistent with agency theory, our findings suggest that management involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance. This finding suggests that management involvement on the BOD may impair the BOD's ability to effectively monitor the actions of management, which may lead managers to make decisions that are more consistent with their own interests than those of the organization.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This study aims to investigate the nature and extent of compliance to the principle-based corporate governance initiatives by the listed companies in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji. Three important questions are addressed: whether listed companies in Fiji have complied with the principle-based governance practices? Did compliance with principle-based recommendations lead to an improvement in the listed company's financial performance and legitimacy? How the institutional factors have contributed towards corporate governance practices in Fiji? Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the SPSE companies over the period 2008-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that listed companies have adopted the Capital Market Development Authority's (CMDA) recommendations by establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, having non-executive/independent directors on the board and separate chair and CEO positions in order to gain legitimacy from stakeholders. Results support the view that the CMDA recommendations of board sub-committees (audit and remuneration) have had positive influence on company performance measured by Tobin's Q. The findings of this study give support to the principle-based corporate governance practices adopted in Fiji to gain legitimacy. Originality/value - The study adds to the governance literature by focusing on the principle-based governance practices in a small remote island country, Fiji which has relatively small economy, capital market and company size. Finally, the study adds to institutional theory by showing how companies' corporate governance choices are affected by the severity of agency conflicts and the way corporate governance is regulated.

This study analyses the influence of board composition on companies' innovation in the Spanish corporate governance system. Drawing from a multi-theoretical perspective, the analysis shows the moderating effect of board member stock ownership on the relationship between board composition and innovation. Using secondary data from a sample of Spanishquoted companies in technology industries over the 2003-2005 period, the findings demonstrate that board composition influences the innovative behaviour of firms, and that this influence is also conditioned by directors' stock ownership because directors' attitude towards innovation could vary depending on their power and on how many shares they own. These results confirm that innovation increases in firms whose boards have a high proportion of affiliated directors with significant stock ownership. This study also makes some important contributions towards creating a more effective board that can shape companies' strategic orientation, highlighting the need to consider the joint impact of board composition and ownership concentration.

This study investigates corporate governance in Kuwait from stakeholders' perspective by examining different stakeholder groups' perceptions. The study presents the concept of corporate governance, the current situation, the corporate governance mechanisms, and the impact of legal system and accountability on Kuwait's corporate governance. The study applied semi-structured interviews with several stakeholder groups; grounded theory procedures are also adopted to interpret the results. The findings suggest that the corporate governance concept is well known, yet current laws are irrelevant; several obstacles need to be addressed to implement corporate governance in Kuwait. According to interviewees, board committees are important in Kuwait, and boards of directors and dividends are dominated by major shareholders. Moreover, some corporate governance mechanisms are not well organized in Kuwait. For example, ownership structures produce problems for listed companies, banks have limited roles, and companies have appointed ineffective independent directors, while the legal system, shareholders' and stakeholders' rights, and shareholders' protections are very weak. In addition, accountability is not clearly identified in Kuwaiti rules. (c) 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Using a sample of 40 French companies listed on the SBF 120 for the period 2002-2009, we examine if board structure (board size, independence of its members and the cumulative functions of decision and control) relate to their performance. To test the validity of our hypothesis, which states the existence of a certain deterministic between the board structure and financial performance measured by four different ratios, namely ROA, ROE, Tobin's Q and Market to Book, we have developed four dynamic panel system GMM approach to control for relevant sources of endogeneity (simultaneity, reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity). Our results support the idea, commonly accepted, that board structure is a determinant factor for French firm performance. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

The Malaysian government has established a strong regulatory framework that underpins the national corporate governance (CG) ecosystem through local rules, regulation and best practices. Following that, this paper seeks to explore the CG compliance - governance structure and practices - of public listed companies in Malaysia. Particularly, this paper investigates the Board-related structure and practice which comprise of board size, board composition, board committee, CEO duality, multiple directorships, board meeting and the age limit for director. Content analysis was used to collect the CG related information of the top 100 companies via their annual reports. The information disclosed was then analyzed against the four key Malaysian CG-related requirements, namely; Companies Act 1965, BM CGG, MCCG and the CG Blueprint 2011. It was found that the board size of the Malaysian companies is appropriate and manageable, with majority of the companies complying with the requirements pertaining to the appointments of INED. Additionally, many companies favor for the separation between CEO and Chairman of the Board in governing their businesses. The companies also regard multiple directorships as a 'healthy' practice; and that their practices in conducting board meeting also in comply with the referred requirements. This study also found that all companies had appointed some of their BODs with the age ranging between 50 and 69. Overall, these findings put forward an insight that majority of the Malaysian companies studied complied beyond the minimal requirement of CG. (c) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

This paper aims outspreading preexisting researches by assessing practically and empirically how board characteristics play a vibrant role in magnitude of earning management (EM) for the Jordanian listed companies. In particular, the paper throws its light on the principle features of the board of directors, i.e. board independence, CEO duality, financial expertise, governance expertise, firm-specific expertise and size. In this paper, a cross-sectional version of the Modified Jones Model is applied to ensure the accurate assessment of the key impacts of board characteristics on EM for a sample of 86 industrial listed companies on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the years 2008 to 2010. Discretionary accruals are used as proxy for EM. This study, on the basis of findings, reveals the significant correlation between salient board features and EM. Findings of this systematic observation demonstrate that board independence, financial expertise, governance expertise and size have a negative relation with EM. It also found that CEO duality and board firm-specific expertise have an obvious positive relation with discretionary accruals. The findings suggested that the board character has an effective role in detecting EM and in turn improve financial reporting quality (FRQ). In real fields, the discoveries of this paper portray valuable information for the regulators in different countries. The results also provide useful information for investors in assessing the impact of board characteristics on FRQ. In fact, previous studies on this very issue in this context do not meet the demand of comprehensive observation appropriately. To make input in this area, particularly among Jordanian companies, this study will extend the scope through providing empirically tested findings of the role of board directors' characteristics on EM. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and EM in Jordan.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze if the composition and activity of the appointment and remuneration committee have a significant effect in the remunerations of the members of the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the paper's objective the authors proposed four hypotheses in order to analyze the repercussions of independent, institutional and executive directors in the Appointment and Retribution Committee (ARC) and its activity in the directors' remunerations. Findings - The results put into evidence that the composition (independent, institutional and executive members) of the ARC is not associated with the variation of the directors remuneration mean, while the activity of the ARC influences positively this remuneration mean, contrary to what was expected. Originality/value - The ARC in Spain is not effective in fixating the directors' remunerations. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The study examines if certain board of directors characteristics influence the CEO's Pay Slice (CPS), i.e. the CEO's share of the combined compensation received by the five top-paid executives of the firm. The results show that the CPS is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors and negatively linked to director stock ownership. We also examine if CPS increases company valuation by investors, as predicted by the tournament theory. Our results upheld this view, showing that there is a positive link between CPS and company market value as predicted by the tournament theory. Although the effect is significant at a threshold of 95%, CPS only explains a small percentage of the variance in company market value.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the cognitive as well as the disciplinary role of one important governance mechanism that is the board of directors in a privatization context. Using a sample of privatized French companies, we examine the relationship between the size, component and structure of this mechanism to the performance and value creation on the post privatization period. Thus, the majority of our findings have support on the theory of cognitive governance, one aspect of governance that was ignored in previous research.

This paper presents several theories to achieve a better understanding of corporate governance structures and their operations in a two-tier-board corporate governance structure. The author also analyses transitional economies using the case of Vietnam. The author investigates the influence of independent directors upon the probability of CEO turnover as well as the sensitivity of the link between performance and turnover. The findings show that non-executive directors are not always independent. At the same time, independent directors have a vital role to play in making decisions concerning CEO dismissal. These directors also reduce the effects of CEO ownership and CEO duality upon the probability of CEO turnover. In summation, the research found that performance and CEO age constitute key factors in CEO turnover, regardless of the corporation or board size.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a "professional board" of directors. The authors utilize state-of-the-art academic literature from the fields of corporate governance and organizational behavior to evaluate the merits and de-merits of the proposed corporate governance model, and present their findings (and recommendations) for improvements in corporate governance practices.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is increasingly becoming a strategic issue that has to be dealt with by top management. The aim of the present study is to analyse the role that women directors can play as driving forces behind the development of CSR in organisations, and contribute to sustainable development. Despite the fact that gender diversity is acquiring considerable importance, most research has focused on analysing how it affects financial performance. In this study, we analyse the implications that gender diversity has on CSR. To do so, we have carried out an empirical study of a sample of firms from a variety of countries and sectors to determine whether those firms with a higher percentage of women on the board of directors are more socially responsible. The results support the hypothesis that gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR. Female talent can play a strategic role in enabling firms to manage their social responsibility and sustainable practices appropriately. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

This paper examines the relationship between board of directors' effectiveness and voluntary climate change disclosures. Since risk management and reporting fall under the board's responsibility, we relate board effectiveness to the firm's decision to voluntarily respond to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) annual questionnaire as well as the quality of disclosures about climate-change-related risks and strategies to mitigate them. Our results show a positive association between board effectiveness and the firm's decision to answer the CDP questionnaire as well as its carbon disclosure quality. The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the determinants of voluntary climate change disclosures. Our findings highlight the importance of the board of directors' role in enhancing the transparency and relevance of voluntary disclosures of climate change business impacts.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - This paper aims to empirically examine the quality of corporate governance (CG) practices in Egyptian-listed companies and their impact on firm performance and financial distress in the context of an emerging market such as that of Egypt. Design/methodology/approach - To assess the level of CG practices at a given firm, the current study constructs a corporate governance index (CGI) which consists of four dimensions: disclosure and transparency, composition of the board of directors, shareholders' rights and investor relations and ownership and control structure. Based on a sample of 86 non-financial firms listed on the Egyptian Exchange, the effects of CG on performance and financial distress are assessed. Tobin's Q is used to assess corporate performance. At the same time, the Altman Z-score is used as a financial distress indicator, as it measures financial distress inversely. The bigger the Z-score, the smaller the risk of financial distress. Findings - The overall score of the CGI, on average, suggests that the quality of CG practices within Egyptian-listed firms is relatively low. The results do not support the positive association between CG practices and financial performance. In addition, there is an insignificant negative relationship between CG practices and the likelihood of financial distress. The current study also provides evidence that firm-specific characteristics could be useful as a first-pass screen in determining firm performance and the likelihood of financial distress. Research limitations/implications - The sample size and time frame of our analysis are relatively small; some caution would be needed before generalizing the results to the entire population. Practical implications - The findings may be of interest to those academic researchers, practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering the quality of CG practices in a developing market such as that of Egypt and its impact on financial performance and financial distress. Originality/value - This paper extends the existing literature, in the Egyptian context in particular, by examining firm performance and the risk of financial distress in relation to the level of CG mechanisms adopted.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

In the last few decades, interest in family firms has increased. There are several analyses in relation to leadership, ownership and succession-related topics, but they omit issues related to stakeholders and corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study broadens empirical evidence in this respect. Using a sample composed of internationally listed companies for the period 2003-2009, we analyse CSR information disclosures in family businesses, as well as the fundamental role of the independence of the board in this regard. Our results show that, in general, the higher the proportion of independent directors, the higher the level of CSR information disclosures; but, in the concrete case of family firms, the "independence" of these directors disappeared, thereby reducing the positive association with information disclosure; this was because independent directors may be strongly influenced by family owners, and even by personal or familiar ties.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

We examine the association between "busyness" of the board of directors (serving on multiple boards) and bank holding company (BHC) performance and risk. We estimate several simultaneous-equations models employing the 3SLS technique and instrumental variables to account for endogeneity. We obtain four main results. First, BHC performance measures (return on equity, Tobin's Q and EBIT over total assets) are positively associated with busyness of directors. Second, BHC risk measures (total, market, idiosyncratic, credit and default risks) are inversely related to busyness of directors. Third, performance (risk) benefits of having busy directors strengthened (weakened) during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Fourth, busy directors are not more likely to become problem directors (fail the 75% attendance standard), and if sitting on boards of both BHC and non-financial firms, they attend more of the BHC board meetings, than those of the non-financials. Our findings partially alleviate concerns that over-boarded directors shirk their responsibilities. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prior studies show that agency conflicts are important in explaining corporate financial policies and that the board of directors is central to corporate governance. In this study, we examine the role of this governing body in the accumulation of cash reserves. Using a sample of 597 French listed firms during 2001-2007, we find that firms with boards deemed to be effective in mitigating agency problems--that is, those appointing independent directors and splitting chief executive officer and chair positions--accumulate less cash reserves than those with less effective boards. Moreover, two-tier boards are more efficient in mitigating the agency costs of free cash flow, leading to less corporate cash hoarding. These findings support the idea that agency conflicts influence cash management policy and that effective boards of directors play an important disciplinary role in a concentrated ownership setting.

Purpose - This paper aims to report the results of an investigation into the effect of corporate governance factors on the performance of listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and examines whether this effect differs between the two sizes of business. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses unbalanced panel data regression analysis on a sample of 234 SMEs listed on the Alternative Investment Market, for a 10-year period (2004-2013). Findings - The panel data analysis results show that for all SMEs, corporate governance factors - board size, chief executive officer (CEO) age and tenure and directors' remuneration - are significantly associated with performance of SMEs. The results also suggest that while board size is associated with the performance of both small and medium enterprises, CEO age is significant only for medium firms and directors' remuneration only for small ones, while CEO tenure and proportion of non-executive directors are not significant for either. Practical implications - Overall, the results imply that corporate governance factors affect the performance of listed SMEs. However, this effect differs significantly between small and medium enterprises. The findings have important implications for policymakers who prescribe corporate governance mechanisms for SMEs. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance of SMEs by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size, CEO age, CEO tenure, directors' remuneration and proportion of non-executive directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between board structure (consisting of board size, board composition, CEO role duality and chairman composition), investment account holders (IAHs) and social contribution and the bank performance in one of the fastest-growing industries, Islamic banking. Design/methodology/approach - A generalized least square (GLS) regression model was used to investigate such relationship applying data from a sample of 40 Islamic banks operating in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries over the period of 2008 until 2011. Findings - The results show that both size and composition of the board have a negative effect on bank performance. On the other hand, the separation of CEO and chairman roles and the IAHs have no effect, while the chairman independence has a positive impact. As for the control variables, bank size positively influences bank performance whereas leverage has a negative effect. Zakah and gross domestic product produce no significant effect on bank performance. Research limitations/implications - Even though the model has explained the significant part of the variation in performance, there are other factors considered as noise in the model which are unexplained due to the lack of data. As such, other mechanisms of corporate governance (CG) comprising attributes of the remuneration and nominating committees and ownership structure may be used in future research. The sample size is also limited; thus, in future research, the sample size could be increased by including Islamic banks operating in all Middle East countries. Practical implications - The results suggest that to yield a better bank performance, Islamic banks should enhance the effectiveness of CG through the board of directors (BODs), whereby any decisions made by the BODs would lead to greater investors' confidence in the market. The results suggest that policymakers should impose new mechanisms that could impact the effectiveness and compliance of BODs on the code of CG and guidelines of micro-finance, in general, and among Islamic banks, in particular. The community also has the right to know up to what extent are the Islamic banks are in compliance with Shariah principles and rules and the impact of their transactions on the society's welfare. Originality/value - BODs' failures are the primary reason for the recent financial collapses, and Islamic banks are not spared from these events. Even though many studies have examined the influence of BODs effectiveness on the performance of conventional banking industry over time, studies on the Islamic financial institutions are quite scarce. In addition, the results obtained by the studies on conventional banks may not be applicable to Islamic banks. This is because the BODs of Islamic banks discharge their responsibilities and duties along with the existence of the Shariah supervisory board (a multi-layer structure), which is quite different from the CG structure in conventional banks that is dependent on the BODs (a single-layer). Therefore, this research attempts to fill the gap in the literature by addressing this issue in the Islamic banking industry by using a stakeholder theory based on Islamic perspective which has not been used yet in previous studies.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

The main objective of this paper is to explore the role of family councils vis-a-vis corporate governance mechanisms. Particularly, the paper explores whether family councils perform only their distinctive family governance role or if they also substitute for the roles performed by corporate governance control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 243 Italian family SMEs, our research findings show that the family council partially substitutes the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors in playing their respective corporate governance roles of ownership and monitoring. These findings are interpreted in the light of both agency and relational perspectives. (c) 2013 International Council for Small Business.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

From the perspective of agency, resource-based view, and resource-dependence theories, we explore the impact of the presence of outside directors on firm performance in family small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs). Using survey data from 369 Spanish family SMEs, our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of outsiders on the boards of first- and second-generation family firms and firm performance. The results show that a balanced presence of outside directors contributes to value creation in family SMEs and confirm that the composition and the roles of the board of directors differ from generation to generation in family firms.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial performance and internal governance structure of Information Technology (IT) sector in India. Various aspects of the board such as board independence, board size, board meeting, board attendance, aspects of leadership with role duality and family ownership are addressed in this study. Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 114 listed IT sector firms in India from 2006 to 2011. To account for endogeneity of the relationship between firm performance, corporate governance and capital structure of the firm, simultaneous system of equations was employed. Findings - The study, after controlling for firm-specific factors, shows that larger board size had a positive impact on firm performance. Independent directors on the board did not show any association with firm performance. The study failed to find any relationship between the number of board meetings and firm performance. However, attendance of the board members was found to be positively associated with firm performance. Family firms showed better performance compared to non-family firms. Originality/value - The study demonstrates that governance measures related to the board in Indian firms have some similarities to the firms in western countries. However, the study shows that some of the widely used board characteristic measures differ with other studies documented in the western contexts which limits the generalisability of the western studies in the emerging countries.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

This paper investigates the association between a range of corporate governance mechanisms and forward-looking disclosure (FLD) in a low information environment: the Chinese stock markets. It finds that the implementation of certain monitoring and control mechanisms, such as financial expertise on audit committees and independent directors on the board of directors, can improve the extent of FLD. However, the size of the supervisory board and separating the roles of the CEO and the chairman of the board of directors is of little help in explaining any improvement in FLD. In contrast, ownership structure appears to play an essential role in determining FLD policies. Indeed, listed firms with high levels of foreign ownership and fewer pyramidal layers in their ownership structure tend to disclose more forward-looking information. Of particular interest, the association between state ownership and FLD is likely to be non-linear (an inverted U-shape), and the inflection point at which the association becomes negative occurs at a state ownership over 33 percent. In summary, this study provides new evidence on the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on FLD in China's unique institutional environment. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to test the association between board of director characteristics and corporate reputation. Design/methodology/approachLogistic and multivariate regressions are performed to analyse whether the board of director characteristics are associated with the level of corporate reputation. The sample is composed of listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange (Indice General de la Bolsa de Madrid) at least once during the period 2004-2010. Corporate governance data were manually extracted from governance reports released by Spanish companies. The data for the design of a corporate reputation measure were obtained from the Monitor Espanol de Reputacion Corporativa (MERCO) institute web site. FindingsResults from the empirical analysis show that Spanish companies that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation index provided by MERCO tend to have a higher percentage of independent directors as well as more female directors on their board. Firm size and the image of the president of a firm are also linked to corporate reputation. Originality/valueThe results have direct implications for the management of corporate governance mechanisms by shareholders who should take into account their role in the creation and maintenance of corporate reputation.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore how initial public offering (IPO) investors view female presence on boards of directors in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes hierarchical regression and analyzes data collected from firms undertaking their IPO's in the USA during 1997 and 2007. Findings - The findings of this study suggest that US IPO investors react negatively to female presence on the board of directors. However, this negative effect has weakened post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study may not generalize to other settings. Practical implications - Gender bias against females in the boardroom exists but appears to be weaker post-Sarbanes-Oxley. Social implications - One hurdle to greater female representation in entrepreneurial ventures in the USA may be weakening as a result of greater awareness of female director contributions to board functioning. Originality/value - First, the study represents one of the few attempts to examine the influence of female directors on organizational outcomes in IPO firms. Second, this study represents one of the first studies to consider the influence of director gender on IPO performance. Finally, this study extends extant research by examining investor reactions to female board presence. The results of this study suggest that bias against females in the boardroom may exist but appears to be weakening post-Sarbanes-Oxley. This finding indicates increasing awareness of female director contributions to board functioning on the part of IPO investors. (c) 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The financial crisis of 2008-2009 was truly global in nature that affected all sectors and countries of the world. Being considered that a board of directors is the main governance mechanism through which a company is governed and managed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the governance structure of a company on its financial performance during the period of financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates the effect of board structure parameters - board leadership, directors and board size on the financial performance for 164 non-financial listed firms in India during the period of financial crisis of 2008-2009. Findings - The study finds a significant positive effect with Chief Executive Officer duality, executive chairperson and proportion of inside directors on the firm's financial performance. Independent directors have no significant influence, while non-executive (grey) director's being affiliated with the firm has a negative influence on firm's financial performance. A larger board has a negative relationship with the firm's financial performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to large non-financial firms of the Bombay Stock Exchange-200 index. The study may be extended to include other firms to generalize the findings. Practical implications - Results imply that during the period of financial distress, a company having more inside (or management) directors with an executive chairperson are in a better position to manage company resources with positive impact on financial performance. Companies with larger boards may find it difficult to take quick decisions, which ultimately affect their performance. Originality/value - The study is original in its idea of assessing company strategy to adopt a suitable governance structure that can sustain its performance during the period of financial crisis.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship of non-financial and financial factors to firm survival, provide evidence of factors related to financial success and distress for prominent Australian agricultural firms, and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes mixed method exploratory case studies across four Australian agricultural firms (two successful and two failed) listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Findings - The authors found that the use of an Integrated Multi-Measured approach provided a higher classification rate for the failed group than those provided by an individual measure. We also discovered that non-financial factors associated with the agricultural organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included managements' involvement in organizational strategy and the composition of the board of directors. It was also apparent that management decision-making approaches may become frozen, or at best restricted, in the face of impending failure, dependent upon the stress level within the organization and the management skill base. Practical implications - The cases studied indicated that non-financial factors of failure occurred prior to any financial predictors, intuitively indicating a relationship between non-financial and financial factors in Australian agricultural firms. Originality/value - The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes which distinguish successful and failing firms can be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on individual directors' economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The discrepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board's dynamic, team task performance efficacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on firm profitability. Our findings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction - thereby lowering information asymmetry - have a significant impact on corporate profitability. Our study demonstrates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on profitability, while the focus on compliance-oriented tasks has a significantly negative effect on profitability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improving board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

There is an increasing scholarly interest in how social enterprises manage their hybrid nature. As hybrid organizational forms, social enterprises combine mission-driven social goals and revenue generating activities in a variety of organizational constellations and in diverse institutional contexts. Acknowledging the potentially conflicting demands that institutional environments impose on social enterprises there is an increasing research interest in the existence and proliferation of these conflicting demands at the organizational level. Some researchers have pointed to the importance of particular management practices and governance characteristics - such as authority relations and internal representation - as mechanisms to deal with the conflicting demands at the organizational level. This paper adds to this stream of literature by taking into account the organizational level dynamics of internal representation and the proliferation of factional groups in the boards of directors of hybrid organizational forms and their impact on board performance, ultimately influencing the organizational performance.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Abstract: As the ultimate decision makers in organizations, boards of directors have a strong influence on organizational success. This study contributes to better understanding of the mechanisms of boards within the tourism sector, more precisely, destination-based tourism organizations wherein several stakeholders collaborate. First, we examine how tourism directors perceive their roles including strategic, control and service roles. Second, as tourism organizations are in a constant need for development and innovation, we study the role of innovative climates as part of the board dynamics. Third, we compare limited liability companies with other tourism organizations to explore the influence of legal structure on the perception of board roles and innovation. The directors perceived the control and strategic tasks as the most relevant for the boards of tourism organizations. Furthermore, they reported generally high scores on climate for innovation with somewhat stronger emphasis on the performance-related climate factors "objectives - mutual and achievable goals" and "task orientation - focus on excellence" than the factors more closely related to social relationships ("support" and "participative safety"). Limited liability companies scored significantly higher on the control and strategic roles as well as the combined climate for innovation variable indicating a stronger investment in the organizations due to the legal responsibility linked to the role of director in such organizations.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the moderating effects of a board of directors on foreign direct investment (FDI)'s international diversification in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of Turkish multinational firms with FDI was used. Two different aspects of international diversification were considered: the relationship between international diversification and financial performance and the moderating effect of board composition on the relationship between international diversification and the firm's financial performance. Firm-level data were obtained from the Istanbul Stock Exchange in Turkey. Findings: The findings reveal that international diversification leads to better financial performance according to market-based measures. On the other hand, this study indicates that the board characteristics have a moderating effect on international diversification and financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a sample of publicly listed firms in Turkey, and this restriction limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: The internalization efforts of Turkish FDI have led to better financial performance in terms of market-based measures. The results have stated that the interest of independent outside directors is aligned with lower-risk investment decisions. Independence of independent outside directors in Turkey is interrogated by practitioners or the Capital Markets Board of Turkey. The larger board size which a moderator variable is provided, the wider shareholder value in Turkey is. Social implications: One can understand that the development of market-supporting institutions provides the support for entry to an emerging economy which is inefficient or incomplete markets and highly concentrated family ownership. Originality/value: These findings provide important implications for corporate governance and highlight the need for further research on the role of governance in firm internationalization. This study not only helps to understand how board characteristics affect the choice of international diversification decisions, but the results also allow to assess the performance implications of these choices for a particular period.

Purpose-The purpose of this article is to examine if certain board characteristics have an impact on the total remuneration of top management and the ratio of stock-based remuneration to total top-management remuneration. Design/methodology/approach-The study draws on data from the largest public Canadian companies, the constituents of the TSX/60 index. The study controls for firm size and profitability. Findings-The authors concludes that total remuneration of top management is directly linked to board-member total remuneration and the board average number of director-tenure years. The study also shows that the ratio of stock-based to total top-management remuneration is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors, total remuneration of board directors, the ratio of stock-based remuneration of directors to their total remuneration and the average number of tenure years of the board of directors. Practical implications-If regulators are determined to curb the excesses in top-management remuneration by means of promoting boards with certain characteristics, they should implement measures facilitating the control of directors' remuneration and tenure, to discourage cronyistic behavior. Good corporate governance requires that the board act as a counterbalance to top management, ensuring that a substantial percentage of top-executive total compensation is variable, and not fixed. According to our findings, the boards that are the most likely to hold managerial avoidance of variable pay in check are those favoring director independence, variable director remuneration and longer director tenures. Social implications-The present article examines specifically the latter aspect, namely, the role of board characteristics (independence, size, compensation, board director ownership and tenure, etc.) in the determination of top-management compensation. This relationship is important because it allows us to further the analysis of corporate governance. If the above-mentioned traits of boards have a meaningful relationship with the compensation of the top management, one might conclude that certain practices in the composition of boards could influence good corporate governance practices. This is relevant for regulatory agencies, for investors and for corporations. Originality/value-The article adds to the extant literature in a number of ways. Firstly, it considers the role of the traits of the board in the determination of the compensation of the top-management teams, and not only of the chief executive officer, as is the focus of previous literature. Secondly, the article focuses on the power interplay between boards and managers, and, more particularly, on the ability of boards to be an effective mechanism of corporate governance. Finally, the article examines the potential impact of board traits in the determination of top-management compensation in the context of Canadian firms, a subject that has received less attention from academic research, which has mostly concentrated on analyzing the issue in the US context.

Board of director member diversity has an impact on the functions each director successfully provides. Appropriate and necessary board member capabilities differ between small and large firms. Although these differences seem apparent, current research has favored studies related to large firms and neglected those related to board member needs of small firms. Grounded in Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, the following manuscript theoretically suggests that firm size moderates the relationship between board member diversity and the two primary functions (monitoring and the provision of resources) of board members. Furthermore, small firms can enhance performance through appropriate member composition in differing ways than large firms. (c) 2015, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The weak corporate governance framework in Indonesia, as in other countries in Southeast Asia, was deemed a crucial factor in deepening the financial and economic crisis in the late 1990s. Over a decade after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries have made substantial governance reforms. The reform measures of the institutional framework, both in the public and corporate sectors, were intended to transform Indonesia into a clean, transparent, and accountable country. While the reforms have resulted in increased political stability, improved government effectiveness, and a more conducive investment climate, corruption remains a major concern in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate how corporate governance mechanisms can reduce the opportunities for corruption. By utilizing agency theory, we argue that a strong corporate governance institutional framework helps to reduce a country's level of corruption. We focus attention on three components of corporate governance mechanisms, i.e., shareholder rights, the quality of the board of directors (BoD), and appropriate accounting and auditing standards, including transparency standards. In an attempt to strengthen corporate governance standards and practices in Indonesia, we conducted a comparative study among Southeast Asian middle-income countries, i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We rely on accessible secondary data such as corporate governance codes, laws, and regulations. Our study concludes that the Indonesian corporate governance institutional framework is less stringent compared to Malaysia and Thailand. This condition provides a favorable environment for corruption to persist because the standards and practices are less demanding and the companies do not necessarily have to comply with the existing regulatory framework.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine whether a firm's operating environment influences the likelihood that the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors. Specifically, using robust regression techniques, we find that when a firm has greater advisory needs and is more reliant on managerial initiatives for innovation, the firm is more likely to appoint its CEO as the chair. We also examine whether CEO-Chairs use their greater bargaining power from holding dual positions to benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders. We find no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs are more likely to extract rents compared to CEOs who are not chairs. Collectively, these findings indicate that the decision by firms to appoint their CEOs as chairs is determined by the firms' operating environment and that there is no evidence to suggest that CEO-Chairs use their power from holding dual positions to the detriment of shareholders.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether the degree of control exercised by management affects the independence of the audit committee over the board of directors. Four characteristics of the board are being examined; size, composition, CEO duality and management ownership. Results from a sample of 54 Lebanese banks operating in various Lebanese territories during the period 2009-2011 show that all of these banks created an audit committee between 2009-2011 and comply with Lebanese central bank regulations (BDL) to guarantee their independence from management which requires the audit committee in Lebanese banks to be including independent members. Empirical results suggest that in Lebanese banks, managers can impair the effectiveness of audit committees by the presence of inside directors on the board and CEO duality.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

The role of corporate governance in financial institutions differs from that of non- financial institutions for the discretionary power of the board of directors would be limited especially in regulated financial systems where financial institutions are obliged to function through legislative and prescriptive procedures, policies, rules and regulations. This study, therefore, was aimed at examining the impact of corporate governance on the performance of closely regulated Ethiopian insurance Industry. The study employed explanatory research design with an econometric panel data of 10 Insurance companies that covers the period 2007 to 2014. Board size, board independence and board diversity have negative and insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies while size and independence of audit committee and frequency of board meetings have positive but insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies in Ethiopia. Thus it could be concluded that all corporate governance mechanisms have insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies measured by return on asset. This vividly affirms that the role of board of directors in closely regulated financial sector is dismal and insignificant for they have limited discretionary power to exercise as board of directors. Thus it would be recommendable if the regulatory body could relax its prescriptive and stringent policies and devolve its power to board of directors without endangering the viability of insurance companies.

This study examines the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms on audit quality which is proxied by audit fees. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on audit quality of Shari'ah compliant companies in Malaysia.Higher quality audit is defined as a higher credibility offered by auditors in their audit work which improved the reliability of financial statements. Corporate governance mechanisms for this study focuses on the board of directors and includes board size, CEO-duality, independent directors, and the financial expertise of the audit committee and internal Shari'ah committee. The sample consists of 100 top Shari'ah compliant companies in Malaysia based on market capitalization by Bursa Malaysia. Using multiple regressions, the significant relationship with audit quality and board size, and their positive relationship shows the higher the board size, the better the audit quality. The control variable used in this study, i.e. leverage,also has a significant positive relationship with audit quality. The findings show that highly leveraged firms demand quality audits. Apart from contributing to past literature on corporate governance and audit quality, this study provides inputs to regulators to encourage strict enforcement for Shari'ah compliant companies to incorporate governance practices, especially concerning board structure and it provides information for directors to become more resourceful in order to improve their relationship with auditors.

This paper gives the empirical analysis of the impact of the boards of directors' composition and structure and the personal characteristics of the boards' members on corporate performance of Russian public and non-public companies. Hypothesis that describe the influence of the boards' characteristics on corporate performance are tested on the panel data of 200 Russian large and medium joint-stock companies during the period between 2007-2011. As a result, we show that firms' efficiency depends on a number of the boards' characteristics (the share of the executive directors, the number of directors with the working experience in the industry, chairman working in the boards of other companies).

Previous studies that have examined the impact of board diversity on firm financial performance have yielded conflicting results. One of the main challenges for studies looking at the impact of diverse directors stems from the fact that firm financial performance and board of director composition may be endogenously determined. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to the problem of endogeneity. By analyzing the reaction of the stock market when a diverse director's departure is announced, we can examine investors' perceptions of the importance of changes in board diversity. Our results show that investors value gender diversity among directors; however, we are unable to conclude that investors value ethnic diversity among directors.

This paper tries to answer the question of top management, public policy makers, researchers and scholars of how important the role of Corporate Governance (CG) and best practices are. Although there are plenty of previous researches, we find it necessary to conduct this study because we believe the outcome will be significant to Bolivia's corporate governance and best practices in order to support and validate the application of the CG's code as management strategy. Likewise, the lack of academic research about this subject in a developing country where these kinds of practices are just starting to be promoted is an important fact, enlightening firms to consider this public policy in order to be more competitive and efficient. We use Pearson's correlations analysis in contrast with multiple regression analysis to examine the significance of Board of directors' characteristics on financial performance ratios and the influence on firm value.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

In this study, we investigate the relations between CEO stock options and analysts' earnings forecast accuracy and bias. We argue that a higher level of stock options may induce managers to undertake riskier projects, to change and/or reallocate their effort, and to possibly engage in gaming (such as opportunistic earnings and disclosure management) and hypothesize that these managerial behaviors will result in an increase in the complexity of forecasting and, hence, in less accurate analysts' forecasts. We also posit that analysts' optimistic forecast bias will increase as the level of stock options pay increases. We reason that as forecast complexity increases with stock options pay, analysts, needing greater access to management's information to produce accurate forecasts, have incentives to increase the optimistic bias in their forecasts. Alternatively, a higher level of stock options pay may lead to improved disclosure because it better aligns managers' and shareholders' interests. The improved disclosure, in turn, may result in more accurate and less biased analysts' forecasts. Using ordinary least squares estimation, we test these hypotheses relating the level of CEO stock options pay to analysts' forecast accuracy and bias on a sample of firms from the Standard & Poor's ExecuComp database over the period 1993-2003. Our OLS models relate forecast accuracy and forecast bias (the dependent variables) to CEO stock options (the independent variable) and controls for earnings characteristics, firm characteristics, and forecast characteristics. We measure forecast accuracy as negative one times the absolute value of the difference between forecasted and actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price and forecast bias as forecasted minus actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price. We control for differences in earnings characteristics by including earnings volatility, whether the firm has a loss, and earnings surprise; for differences in firm characteristics by including firm size, growth (measured as book-to-market ratio, percentage change in total assets, and percentage change in annual sales), and corporate governance quality (measured as percentage of shares outstanding owned by the CEO, whether the CEO is also chairman of the board of directors, number of annual board meetings, and whether directors are awarded stock options); and for differences in forecast characteristics by including analyst following and analyst forecast dispersion. In addition, the models include controls for industry and year. We use four measures of options: new options, existing exercisable options, existing unexercisable options, and total options (sum of the previous three), all scaled by total number of shares outstanding, and estimate two models for each dependent variable, one including total options and the other including new options, existing exercisable options, and existing unexercisable options. We also use both contemporaneous as well as lagged values of options in our main tests. Our results indicate that analysts' earnings forecast accuracy decreases and forecast optimism increases as the level of stock options (particularly new options and existing exercisable options) in CEO pay increases. These findings suggest that the incentive alignment effects of stock options are more than offset by the investment, effort allocation, and gaming incentives induced by stock options grants to CEOs. Given that analysts' forecasts are an important source of information to capital markets, our finding of a decline in the quality of the information provided by analysts has implications for the level and variability of stock prices. It also has implications for information asymmetry and cost of capital, as well as for valuation models that rely on analysts' earnings forecasts. (c) Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

Despite the socio-political, ethical and business case for female board membership, women remain underrepresented in company boards. Using theories that support the membership of women on boards, this article presents the case for gender diversity in the boardroom. By employing a sample of 506 directors from 56 JSE-listed mining companies this article reports on the demographic characteristics, percentage of women in mining boards, and attributes that are predictive of women's membership on boards. Results show that women serving on mining boards possess specialised knowledge in combination with advanced education. They either bring external support as outsiders, or are support specialists with financial, legal, arts and economics backgrounds. This study recommends the development of a talent management framework of women directors focused on their recruitment, development and retention. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance on firm performance for a large representative sample. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical analysis focuses on a large number of companies covering 20 important industries of the Indian manufacturing sector for the period 2001-2010. Several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes, including system generalized methods of moments, which effectively overcomes the problem of endogeneity and simultaneity bias. Findings: On one side, the findings indicate that larger boards are associated with a greater depth of intellectual knowledge, which in turn helps in improving decision-making and enhancing the performance. On the other side, the results indicate that return on equity and profitability is not related to corporate governance indicators. The results also suggest that CEO duality is not related to any firm performance measures for the sample firms. Practical implications: The outcomes of the analyses advocated that companies that comply with good corporate governance practices can expect to achieve higher accounting and market performance. It implies that good corporate governance practices lead to reduced agency costs. Hence, it is concluded that firms of the developing world can possibly enhance their performance by implementing good corporate governance practices. Originality/value: Departing from the conventional system of the prior studies and instead of focusing on a single measure framework, a range of measures of corporate governance and firm's performance variables are used. Also, several alternative specifications and estimation techniques are used for analysis purposes. Furthermore, the sample also covers a large sample of manufacturing firms.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between gender and environmental sustainability. Based on a sample of 296 firms, drawn from the population of US publicly traded firms over a five-year period, we empirically test whether firms that have (1) more gender diverse boards of directors and (2) more policies and practices that enable or reinforce gender diversity throughout the organization, adopted more environmentally responsible policies and practices. We find that both 'demographic' and 'structural' gender diversity are significant predictors of a firm's environmental sustainability initiatives. Our findings show gender diversity is a sustainability issue as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We survey the literature on corporate governance in banks in the US and international settings. We discuss how the specialness of banks, deposit insurance, high bank leverage, and bank regulation interact with bank governance. We evaluate bank governance from three perspectives: (1) maximizing bank equity value, (2) maximizing total enterprise value, and (3) maximizing social objectives. Our survey includes evidence on how bank governance differs from that of manufacturing firms. We also survey studies on managerial incentives in banks and their implications for bank performance and risk taking before and during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Research Findings/Insights: The high leverage (usually above 90 percent) of banking institutions gives rise to a trade-off between strengthening equity governance and maximizing enterprise value. Aligning managers very closely with shareholders can give rise to strong incentives for risk shifting to the detriment of firm value. The bank risk choices might also go against the societal objectives of a stable financial system. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We provide a framework for the optimal design of bank governance and bank regulation, considering the objectives of both depositors and society-at-large in addition to those of bank shareholders. This framework could be especially important in determining risk choices by banks and the effects of such on the stability of the financial system. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our analysis of the literature surveyed has policy implications for bank regulation, top-management compensation in banks, and directives for design of governance in banks. We discuss implications for direct regulation of banks and regulation of bank governance. The findings surveyed provide guidance for board independence, board size, board composition, and incentive features in top-management compensation. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines a sample of 341 corporations that were ranked in the Fortune 500 in all seven years from 2006 through 2012. We compiled data from multiple corporate recognition lists including the following: the Most Admired Companies, the Most Ethical Companies, the Best Companies to Work for, and the Best Corporate Citizens. Our findings indicate that the higher the percentage of women on a company's board of directors, the more likely the company is to appear on these lists. We also found that the average percentage of women directors for the listed companies was significantly higher than the average percentage of women directors for the companies that did not appear on any of these lists over the period from 2006 through 2012.

Business operations have been severely impacted by the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions affecting economic development. Consequently, public pressure has been directed at businesses to build resilient and sustainable operations, especially in ASEAN countries, whose fragile natural environments make them among the most vulnerable to climate change. To better understand organisational responses, this study investigated the influence of internal resources and geographical regional effects on climate change business strategy. It provided empirical evidence from ASEAN countries based on the combined views of institutional and resource-based theories. Generally, ASEAN businesses were aware of climate change, and focused on strategies of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Even though few businesses integrated climate change into their business strategy, there are several factors (board of directors with international experience, organisational slack, and country effect) that influence ASEAN climate change business strategy.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the representation of women on the boards (WOMBDs) and audit committees is associated with a reduction in the practice of earnings management and whether women are associated with income reducing (conservative) rather than income-increasing (aggressive) earnings management. The authors further argue that family ownership moderates the relationship between the presence of WOMBDs and audit committees and earnings management. Design/methodology/approach-The study uses non-finance firms listed on Bursa Malaysia over a period of four years, i.e. from 2008 until 2011. Findings-The evidence reveals that the presence of WOMBD or audit committee is not associated with a propensity for earnings management. In addition, the evidence also reveals that family ownership does not interact either with WOMBD or with women on the audit committee (WOMAC) to influence the propensity for earnings management. Nevertheless, the additional analyses show that, while women on boards are not associated with income-decreasing accruals, the presence of women on audit committees leads to income-reducing earnings management. The evidence further reveals that family ownership does not interact with either WOMBD or WOMAC to influence income-decreasing earnings management. Originality/value-This study extends prior research on the role of women directors and women audit committee members on earnings management focussing on family ownership. Further, the study also examines the direction of earnings management as opposed to the most prior studies, which mainly focus on the propensity of earnings management.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We investigate the role of gender diversity on corporate boards in mitigating internal control weaknesses (ICWs). We predict and find that firms with greater female board representation are less likely to have ICWs. The results are not driven by females sitting on the audit committee. Instead, it appears that females on corporate boards reduce ICWs, regardless of whether they sit on the audit committee or not. Our results are inconsistent with the critical mass theory, showing that even one female board member could reduce the likelihood of ICWs. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with female board members' typical characteristic tendency shown in prior literature (e.g., being more likely to discuss difficult issues, more fiscally conservative, better monitors, and less tolerant of opportunistic behaviors). Our results have implications for board member selection from a policy perspective as well as board member monitoring from an investor and regulator perspective. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of women on the board of directors on corporate tax avoidance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use multivariate regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female directors on the board and tax aggressiveness. They also test for self-selection bias in the regression model by using the two-stage Heckman procedure. Findings - This paper finds that relative to there being one female board member, high (i.e. greater than one member) female presence on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias and using several alternative measures of tax aggressiveness. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the extant literature on corporate governance and tax aggressiveness. This study is subject to several caveats. First, the sample is restricted to publicly listed Australian firms. Second, this study only examines the issue of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness in the context of Australia. Practical implications - This research is timely, as there has been increased pressure by government bodies in Australia and globally to develop policies to increase female representation on the board of directors. Originality/value - This study is the first to provide empirical evidence concerning the association between the presence of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness.

This study examines how firms use benchmarking information about peers to determine the compensation that they offer to chief executive officers (CEOs). It jointly addresses two distinct perspectives: pay equity and managerial power. Pay inequity provides strong motivation for CEOs to restore equity, by promoting the logic of external fairness and urging boards of directors to implement peer benchmarking and adjust the focal CEO's compensation levels. Although pay inequity may motivate CEOs to restore equity, their reaction to inequity may be effective only when they have sufficient power over the board of directors to influence the pay-setting process. Results from a sample of 1,555 CEOs generally support predictions about the moderating effects of CEO power in the relationship between a focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay. The compensation for underpaid CEOs with relatively greater power over the board is associated with their peers' compensation, suggesting that peer benchmarking is more aggressively used to adjust CEO compensation upward. For overpaid CEOs, the relationship between the focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay is weaker when the CEOs have greater influence over the board, suggesting that such CEOs are able to avoid the use of benchmarking and downward adjustments of pay.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

In the private sector, research on information technology (IT) governance has frequently applied the classical view of agency theory and focused on the controlling role played by the board of directors in constraining a potentially opportunistic manager/agent. However, in the public sector, the board of directors does not exist and there may be less need to focus on the controlling aspect of governance and more need to focus on the politically challenging distribution of state resources. In this U.S.-state-based study, we adopt, apply, and extend the legal view of agency theory past its sole focus on the board of directors as the solitary mediating hierarch in order to examine the strategic mediating hierarch role played by the state legislature and then conceptualize and test for the existence of a tactical mediating hierarch played by the IT steering committee and the production role of an independent Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in using a fee-for-service funding model. We apply these concepts to extend theory to examine the combination of roles that lead to superior outcomes for the state (the principal) versus those necessary for the IT department (the agent). Our results show that by shifting from the control-oriented view of governance in the private sector to a more mediating view in the public sector, important practices may be portable between the public and private sector, despite their widely differing structures.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

This study examines the remuneration of non-executive directors, examining individual monitoring characteristics and director capital in addition to firm characteristics. Using a large sample of FTSE All-Share non-executive directors from 2001 to 2012, we find that remuneration is positively linked to both directors' individual characteristics and firm characteristics. We find that director age, tenure, and network size are positively related to remuneration, suggesting that directors' ability to contribute to board decision-making and their set of resources are valued by firms. We find that director remuneration is negatively related to monitoring characteristics such as director independence, suggesting possible agency considerations, as effective monitors of top management are paid less. However, director ownership has a non-linear relationship with remuneration, and is substitutive at higher levels of ownership. We also observe that UK boards are relatively homogeneous, with few female directors and even fewer Chairmen, and find strong evidence of a gender gap in remuneration when examining inter- and intra-firm variations. Our findings have implications for regulators who seek to intervene in board appointments, as they indicate that firms do not necessarily value or reward resources brought by female or independent directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on the participation of women on Boards of Directors (BD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a body of literature (theoretical and empirical words) that analyzes the women's role on the BD of companies. The review allows the authors to bring together the theoretical foundations and the empirical findings of studies that have examined the influence of the engagement of women on BD on the business outcomes of the firms involved. Findings - There is no agreement on the results relating to the effect of the presence of women on these boards. Moreover, there is no well-defined theoretical basis to explain this relationship, making it necessary to use a multi-theoretical approach. Research limitations/implications - This study could be extended by including investigations of the intermediate variable between the composition of the BD and the business outcomes, thus enabling an analysis of the effects of different organizational variables on the economic and financial variables already studied. In addition, the authors propose a comparative study between different countries and between different kinds of companies. Originality/value - This paper highlights the controversy that exists over the significance of the involvement of women on the BD of companies. It also proposes the development of new lines of research to attempt to answer some of the questions that are raised by the diverse findings reported in the literature.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

We study the effect of board size on firm value in Australia. Using a large sample of Australian firms over the period 2001-2011, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship. We show that firms with a large board are associated with CEO compensation that is sensitive to firm size, but not to firm performance. This incentive to accumulate assets is congruent with the fact that firms with a large board also exhibit lower operating performance and higher operating costs. Furthermore, we find that the effect of board size is stronger in small firms. This result might explain why earlier studies, which focused on large Australian firms, found board size to have little impact on firm value. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study examines the role of the top management team (TMT) and governance structures in the use of corporate venture capital (CVC) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO). The study is unique in that it sheds light on governance-related antecedents of strategic decision making in such firms. We integrate the insights of behavioral agency and upper echelon perspectives to develop our hypotheses. Our results show that in the presence of non-duality, a negative curvilinear relationship exists between TMT heterogeneity and the use of CVC. We also find that TMT heterogeneity and ownership motivate the use of CVC but only up to a certain threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures of entrepreneurship and strategy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and CEO positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

In theory, nonprofit boards of directors exist to perform mission-setting and oversight functions that help to ensure organizational accountability. Yet there is evidence that board behavior often falls short of this ideal. Using survey data from a sample of 241 executive directors of nonprofit agencies, we investigated whether nonprofit boards are meeting executive directors' expectations, and if not, what factors explain this? We find that although board behavior tends to align closely with executive directors' preferences for involvement in administration and management tasks, there is a greater disconnect between board behavior and executive directors' preferences for involvement in mission-setting and oversight duties. Factors that mitigate this gap include organizational professionalization and stability, whereas more extensive reliance on government funding exacerbates it. Female executive directors experience a greater disconnect in their preferences for board involvement and actual board involvement than male executive directors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

Corporate governance issues are critical in university spin-offs because, since their substantially knowledge and technology-driven nature, investments are characterized by rapid growth and real investment opportunities, affecting innovative activity too. In this view, the paper investigate the role of the board of directors' composition on innovation performance of university spin-offs. Based on a panel sample of 478 Italian university spin-offs, the results show that board size has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with innovation, remarking that not too large boards are more efficient and work better, influencing in a positive way the innovation activity of the spin-off. Regarding the impact of the outside directors, the results seems to invalidate its positive and significant effect on innovation performance. Also the CEO-duality seems to have no influence on the innovative activity. These findings may represent potential indicators of the optimal configuration for board in university spin-offs in order to improve innovation.

The main objectives of this study are two-fold. The first one is to determine the relevance that the academic world has given to the study of the relationship between corporate governance and innovation. The second is to identify the key aspects of this relationship that deserve further investigation, and the models in which the research is recently interested in order to advance in this field. To do so, a systematic literature review was conducted on the relationship between corporate governance and innovation. The findings show that the main topics discussed include ownership concentration and the composition and structure of boards of directors, whose impacts on innovation have been analyzed with scarce consensus. Many academic works have studied these elements of corporate governance separately; however, studies analyzing ownership and board together are becoming more frequent, highlighting the moderating effect of some aspects of government on others, and how their influence depends on contingent factors. To the authors' best knowledge, no similar systematic review has been undertaken on this subject, although such reviews allow us to visualize better the evolution of topics with a long research tradition and identify the main findings and the lines of research open.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate board director disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to check whether gender diversity, education, independence and size of the board of directors affect measures of corporate value creation. Findings: The empirical results show that corporate value creation is positively influenced by the cross effect of the board independence and the presence of women. They also point out a positive impact of the cross effect of board independence and management education. They reveal that the board of directors contributes significantly to corporate value creation, particularly when there is a mix of independent, female and management-qualified directors. Originality/value: The evidence presented and discussed in this paper should be of interest to managers and regulators. The methodological approach and the empirical results extend the existing literature. They enrich the limited empirical research devoted to this theme, especially in a continental European context, i.e. France. They shed light on the effect of board of directors' disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of corporate governance in companies and to delineate their effect from the perspective of two variables: the financial performance of firms; and an examination of executive turnover. An analysis on theoretical grounds of these two variables is made with respect to non-financial companies specifically in the context of the country of Jordan. Also in the context of this study, a company represents a firm. A sample comprising 109 companies from the non-financial sector for the fiscal year 2011 was selected and analyzed. A cross sectional study tested all hypotheses of the study and used statistical software, SPSS 20, to analyze the data. The study has examined the structure of the board of directors and its effects on the financial performance (financial leverage) of the non-financial Jordanian companies. Evidence suggests that the corporate governance mechanisms such as increasing the board size has a positive effect on reducing the level of financial leverage, thus leading to enhanced levels of financial performance. On the other hand, board independence and the structure of non CEOduality have no effect on a company's financial performance. In addition, the findings revealed that executive turnover has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between some of the factors and that is the board size and financial leverage. Given the diversity of trends utilized to measure the financial performance of companies in the area of corporate governance and the associated performance relationship, empirical research has continued to undergo new financial performance indicators to prevent manipulation and to obtain a realistic picture of the financial performance of companies. Hence, this is the first study that internationally chooses financial leverage to represent the financial performance of companies in their relationship with corporate governance. Crucially, it is globally the first study to choose executive turnover as a moderating variable on such a relationship. Thus, choosing these two new variables uniquely contributes to the literature of both corporate governance and firm performance from the perspective of developed and developing countries. This is considered to extend and add new insights to prior research in this discipline. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to policy-makers, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties in the Middle East; specifically in Jordan.

This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and 'increased career risks' perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country's culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest.

Purpose: Literature has suggested that the agenda of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an extension of corporate governance (CG) and would be under the responsibility of the board of directors. In this sense, the authors seek to understand the perception of board members on the CSR issue. Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory survey with 128 Brazilian board members was carried out. The authors looked at their perception about the incorporation of CSR in business agendas and on what they consider when deciding on issues related to CSR. Findings: The results show that board members understand the organization more as an entity that has a social role to play than something that simply acts pragmatically. This position is reflected in their decision-making processes rather than in the values and beliefs of the controllers' majority shareholders, which consider what creates long-term value for organizations. The directors seek to create and maintain value for organizations for them to operate sustainably. Practical implications: This research contributes to structuring boards. When choosing board members, having only technical requirements is no longer sufficient; their psychological profile and history also need to be taken into account. It also contributes to the drafting of CSR policies by showing what board members think of CSR and how they make decisions. Originality/value: This study focuses on understanding how the director as an individual observes CSR. Much has been studied about CG, CSR and board members; however, little is known regarding the opinion of board members with regard to CSR. The authors are suggesting an approach to the singularities of directors as another direction in governance research. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

In the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997/1998, the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) issued the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2000 (MCCG 2000). It was subsequently revised in 2007 following the Enron and Transmile debacles. In 2012, the SC issued the latest MCCG 2012 which introduced several new recommendations that are in line with developments in other parts of the world. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the structure of the board and its activities on firm performance post MCCG 2007. The study also aims to shed light on the effectiveness of the board of directors since the issuance of MCCG 2000 and of MCCG 2007. It also aims to reveal the preparedness of listed firms in Malaysia to embrace MCCG 2012. Using a population of non-finance listed firms for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 financial years, it was found that board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, directors' busyness, nomination committee independence, the establishment of a risk management committee (RMC) and board meetings are not associated with firm performance, i.e. Tobin's q. However, the market appears to be in favour of a larger board size. As for return on assets (ROA), it is not associated with board independence, board size, directors' busyness and nomination committee independence. On the other hand CEO duality and the establishment of a RMC improve ROA, while board meetings are detrimental to ROA. It can therefore be concluded that board independence is not associated with either Tobin's q or ROA. Hence, any corporate governance reforms should not over-emphasize the representation of independent directors on the board, rather the focus might be shifted to board activities, such as board meetings and the establishment of a RMC. With regard to board size, since the market is in favour of a larger board size, firms should increase the board's size to enable the appointment of women directors to the board. Finally, combining the CEO and board chairman roles should not be disallowed as the market views this favourably. Hence, the 'one-hat approach' does not appear to be applicable in the case of CEO duality. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The current study examines the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on corporate financial performance (CFP). Prior studies document a positive CSR-CFP association without considering the moderating effects of chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics such as compensation incentives and tenure. Our results show evidence of a positive association between CSR and CFP only in the firms managed by short-tenured, high-cash paid CEOs and particularly during an industry's cooling-off period. The results imply that the incentives embedded in the current CEO pay are not effective and CEOs use CSR as a compensation management tool to increase their share-based pay. To encourage a CEO to implement CSR engagement, particularly during an industry's boom period, the board of directors should decrease common-share payments and increase the CEO's option payments. In addition, the proportion of cash compensation in the CEO's total compensation should not be reduced. (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This study examines the degree to which senior executive members of a school's decision-making team (senior management team and board of directors) are aligned on fundamental principles of school strategy. Our study is based on a conceptual framework of strategic leadership as it applies in an Australian independent school context. We also examine the differences between the senior management team and board of directors based on top management team (TMT) tenure heterogeneity, and how these differences account for TMT associations with school strategy. Implications for research and practice complete the study. The terms top management team, senior management team, and senior leadership team are used interchangeably in this article.

This study aims to examine the direct effects of board of directors' quality and insider ownership on firms' capital structure and the moderating effect of insider ownership on the relationship between board of directors' quality and firms' capital structure. The sample of this study consists of the time period 2005-2011. The final sample consists of 535 firm-year observations of public nonfinancial firms listed on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM). The hypotheses are tested using a random effects model. The results reveal that the coefficient sign on the board of directors' quality is as predicted, but the coefficient sign is insignificant. Further, the results show that insider ownership is positively associated with leverage at the significant level of 10%, suggesting that the inside substantial shareholders employ higher leverage. With regard to the moderating effect of insider ownership, the findings show that the effect of the board of directors' quality-leverage relationship becomes negative and stronger with increasing insider ownership.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the non-financial causes of organizational success or failure, provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes exploratory case studies in investigating the relationship of non-financial factors to organizational success or failure across a sample of sector-specific Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. A two-tailed study was designed, in which seven cases from both extremes were chosen from three Australian business sectors: finance, property and manufacturing. Findings - Non-financial factors associated with the organizations studied impacted their success or failure. These factors included management skill, experience and involvement in organizational strategy, feedback and resultant activity, together with board of director composition. The identification of financial and non-financial factors and sound internal processes could be utilized for the development of an early warning predictor of organizational success or failure. Research limitations/implications - The use of this method is very time-consuming but is highly valuable in case study research, providing a more in-depth understanding of how non-financial factors impact organizational success or failure. Practical implications - The research will provide a better understanding of the symptoms of financial distress and improve the predictive capacity of financial failure models. The improvement in prediction of organizational failure will reduce the costs of failure to all areas affected, from the large corporation to the small business. The inter-connectivity of all businesses to each other often results in a knock-on effect of failure with the cost being borne by all members of the community in some manner. The level of social impact and cost of failure can only be seen by the enormous costs of the Global Financial Crisis failures. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on effective qualitative research and explores important areas of consideration for those conducting qualitative multiple-case studies. It is intended to be of use to researchers investigating the area of predictors of organizational failure or success. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of what makes boards effective. We analyse the relationships between board demography and company performance and between working structures and board tasks in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We test our hypotheses on a sample of 307 Spanish SMEs. The main empirical result is the negative impact that the proportion of outside directors and the board size have on firm performance. We also find a negative impact of outsiders' presence and a positive impact of director tenure on the board's service role. Our analysis of the role of board control highlights the negative relationship between this variable and CEO tenure.

The board of directors is crucial and very important in a business control structure. The value of boards in decision making and increasing the wealth of shareholders depends on how well directors perform their functions. However, the role of foreign independent directors (FIDs) in a firm can never be over emphasized. It is expected that they can improve the advisory role of boards because of direct information about international markets. This study, therefore, investigated if there is a significant difference between the performance of firms with and those without FIDs. The paper observed that a non- significant relationship existed between the tested parameters. This non-substantial difference is likely to be due to the fact that international directors have a tendency to adjust to the socio-organizational values of the location in which they function from. The study, therefore, recommends that FIDs should be encouraged because of their different backgrounds. This will enable them to add to the firm's values and various skills which some domestic board members do not possess. In orderto encourage both minority and majority foreign investors, foreign board members should be allowed on boards for assurance that the corporation is being managed by professionals in their best interests.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

This paper aims to contribute to the corporate governance literature by examining the effects of board governance and ownership structure on financing decisions in an emerging country context. Using hand collected corporate governance data from a panel sample of 110 publically-listed firms in Bangladesh over 2009-2012, this study finds that the corporate debt ratio is not related to standard board of directors mechanisms.The results indicate that board of directors play little role in resolving conflicts in an environment with the presence of strong principal-principal agency conflict. The study also finds no evidence of institutional investors' activism in a manner that is consistent with the goals of other outside stockholders due to the weak regulatory and market discipline. This empirical evidence from the principal-principal agency conflicts (conflict of interest between majority shareholders and minority shareholders) offers insights to policy makers in emerging countries interested to protect minority shareholders' rights and to ensure effective corporate governance of capital structure decisions.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

The purpose of corporate governance mechanisms is to prevent opportunistic behaviour by managers, in order to align the interests of owners and managers. Following from this, our research topic is the analysis of ownership concentration as an internal mechanism to protect the interests of shareholders. In the study of the interdependence between ownership concentration and shareholder protection, particular importance needs to be given to the relationship between ownership structure, the role of the board, and strategic decision-making. Starting from this interdependence, our research aim is to examine the impact of ownership concentration on the protection of shareholders' interests and the board's responsibility for firm strategy. This paper presents the results of an empirical, pilot study in the Republic of Serbia. The research confirms the interdependence of corporate governance mechanisms and strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that ownership concentration protects majority shareholder interests and leads to lower board responsibility for strategic decision-making.

Literature has devoted limited attention to going public process of family business and, to date, there is no evidence of what the drivers for IPO survival of such firms could be. In the setting of listed companies, the composition of a board of directors is critical when the health and effectiveness of firms are at issue. The aim of the article is to analyse if board structure of publicly listed family firms affects their survivability on the capital market after IPO. We develop testable hypotheses regarding the structure of the board of directors in terms of (a) the presence of family members; (b) the presence of independent directors; (c) the role of the founder as chairperson. The results are robust to logistic regression and Cox hazard model and they show a curvilinear relationship between the ratio of family members in the board of directors and the likelihood of post-IPO delisting and a positive linear relationship between the ratio of independent directors in the board and the likelihood of post- IPO delisting. Both the relationships are moderated in negative way by the founder chairperson. (c) 2016 IABE.

The worldwide business practices bring more attention to corporate governance. Board of directors (BOD) is also assumed as the central mechanism of corporate governance. However, whether the board composition will influence firm profitability is still questionable. This paper investigates the effect of the size of BOD and magnitude of executive directors on the firm profitability. Based on generalized methods of moments regressions on a sample of 267 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia during 2010-2013, it is found that the board size and executive ratio have a positive impact on the firm profitability, although the coefficient value of the executive ratio considerably is greater than the coefficient of the board size. Moreover, persistent profitability is remarked by both models|. The age of the firm factor has an insignificant relationship with firm profitability. However, leverage has a negative significant influence on the firm profitability, but the effect of liquidity on profitability is positive. (c) 2016, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of the reality of women on the Boards of Directors of Brazilian companies. Based on the Human Capital Theory, we have analyzed the characteristics of education and professional experience of Brazilian female board members, as well as the gender composition of 410 publicly traded companies listed with BM&FBovespa, in 2011. Our results indicate that only 7.3 % of the BD seats in the companies sampled were occupied by women, indicating inequality of opportunities for women in the BDs of these companies. The study also showed that the main reason for female nominations to Brazilian BDs was not necessarily investments in human capital, but family ties with company owners, which was the case of 40 % of the women surveyed.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Prior research on post-acquisition performance suggests positive, negative, or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms. Grounding our arguments on the extended resource-based view, the current article proposes that business group-affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long-term acquisition performance, relative to standalone firms, especially in emerging economies such as India. Additionally, we hypothesize that both within-group heterogeneity, manifested as prior group experience, group diversification, and intra-group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors, also affect the long-term post-acquisition performance of affiliated firms. The findings, obtained with a buy-and-hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions, both domestic and cross-border, by Indian firms during 2005-2013, provide robust support for the theoretical arguments.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in Italy, where the recently enforced Law 120/2011 prescribes gender quotas for boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity-firm financial performance relationship in an unbalanced panel of 918 Italian listed companies during the years 2011-2014. Findings: Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin's Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that board gender diversity is not a simple "numbers game", greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards and Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors. Originality/value: Most articles on this topic use data from countries with a legal system based on common law; this paper analyses Italy, a country with a civil law system. This is almost certainly the first study to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in the Italian market. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the impact of board of director gender diversity on corporate tax aggressiveness. Based on a sample of 418 U.S. firms covering the 2006-2009 period (1672 firm-year observations), our ordinary least squares regression results show a negative and statistically significant association between female representation on the board and tax aggressiveness after controlling for endogeneity. Our results are consistent across several measures of tax aggressiveness and additional robustness checks. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether gender diversity on board and financial expertise on audit committee affect accounting conservatism in banking sector. Additionally, the authors focus on the effects of board characteristics on bank earnings quality and examine their effects on earnings persistence. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a large sample of 159 banks from nine different countries from the period 2004-2010. The authors study whether the differences in the timeliness of earnings to bad news and earnings quality across governance structures of banks are driven by differences across investor protection and bank regulation levels in banks. Findings: The findings confirm the monitoring role of both female and financial experts, noting a positive effect of them on accounting conservatism and earnings quality in banks. According to the institutional characteristics, the results suggest the complementary role of banking regulation and investor protection levels in these effects, noting that in contexts of higher regulatory and greater investor protection environments, gender diversity and financial expertise on boards have more influence on the conservatism and earnings quality of banks. Originality/value: The authors contribute to both the accounting quality literature and the corporate governance literature by identifying board characteristics that are associated with higher conservatism and quality of earnings in banks around the world. In addition, this study also contributes to the ethics literature by highlighting the benefits of gender diversity and financial expertise in upholding the integrity of financial reporting. Moreover, this paper adds to prior literature about board of directors and accounting quality by identifying additional complementary factors - bank regulation and investor protection - and by focusing on a specific industry, the banking industry.

This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature about the link between board characteristics and the level of social responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008-2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

This paper examines the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on companies' decision to assure their sustainability reports and their choice of assurance provider in countries with a greater stakeholder orientation. The corporate governance factors analyzed are related to the strength of the board's monitoring function, which is determined by the size, independence and activity of the sustainability committee. The international sample consists of 610 companies operating in countries that are more stakeholder oriented from the period 2007-2014. We propose alternative logit models of analysis using the random effects estimator. Consistently with our propositions, our results provide evidence that a firm's sustainability assurance and its choice of the accounting profession are positively associated with board independence and the activity of the sustainability committee. In addition, the empirical evidence obtained shows a U-shaped relationship between the board size and assurance issues.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the association between board demographics and firm financial performance of Karachi Stock Exchange companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The connection between board structure and firm performance has attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded many inconsistent empirical results. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the relationship between board structure and the performance of Pakistani public listed companies by using a sample of Karachi Stock Exchange 100 (KSE-100) indexed companies. This study exploits the corporate performance by accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q), and economic profit (economic value added). Findings: The outcome of the study shows the positive relationship between the board size, minority representation in board, and family director's in-board and firm performance. The authors also find that, instead of adding value, independent directors in Pakistan are negatively associated with firm value. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on KSE-100 indexed companies from 2009 to 2013; however, a large sample and multiple years' data are required. Practical implications: The paper provides empirical evidence that board independence is not necessary for public-listed companies in Pakistan and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on corporate governance and firm performance by introducing a framework for identifying and analyzing moderating variables that affect the relationship between board structure and firm performance.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Purpose: This study is aimed at analyzing the influence of the size of the board of directors, audit committee, institutional ownership and managerial ownership on the financial performance of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Methodology: The study analyses 156 Indonesia firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange using linear regression analysis. Findings: The results indicated that the size of the board of directors has a positive effect on financial performance, while the size of the audit committee, institutional ownership and managerial ownership has no effect on the financial performance. While on the simultaneously testing, it showed that the size of the board of directors, audit committee size, institutional ownership and managerial ownership influence the financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The research has been limited to the manufacturing sector of Indonesian companies and the internal mechanism of corporate governance. The study suggests considering an external mechanism of corporate governance as predictor variables. Originality: The study adds to the literature of corporate government and firm performance in emerging countries. The study implies that corporate governance mechanism for audit committee, managerial ownership and institutional ownership do not enhance company performance. The average size of an audit committee just to fulfill the regulation. Corporate governance mechanism that improve financial performance is size board director. Improvement in board performance as board size increase has positive impact that enhance financial performance of company. (c) 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The role of the nomination committee (NC) in the selection of members of various ethnic groups for board membership has increased significantly as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008. A company board that comprises directors who come from all the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian Malaysians) increases the efficiency of the board in its monitoring and advising roles. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012), the NC shall be responsible for the appointment and recognition of candidates of diverse backgrounds into the board and committee. With that in mind, this paper examines the presence of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors in a nomination committee and its impact on the ethnic diversity of its board. This paper also examines the influence of the executive directors who are members in the nomination committee on the nomination process. For this purpose, 393 (50%) Malaysian listed companies were selected from the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Only non-financial companies were included because other companies such as finance have a different set of regulations in Malaysia. In this study, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression were used for the purpose of revealing important significance of the variables used. In order to control possible endogeneity issues, the GMM estimator was also administered. The regression results of the ethnic diversity model are statistically significant, showing that, a higher proportion of Malay and Chinese directors in a nomination committee has negative relationships while a higher proportion of Indian directors in a nomination committee increases their representation on the board. However, the proportion of executive directors in the nomination committee was found to have a significant impact on the director nomination process of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors. In order to test the robustness of the model, several sets of measures were used. In conclusion, it is deduced that the results of this study support the social identity theory and power struggle, it shows the importance of diversity within the nominating committee of Malaysian companies. The result also reveals that unbiased and effective board mix enhances the strategic decision-making process of the board.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the board composition on financial performance in the restaurant industry from a stewardship theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The composition of board was measured as the ratio of inside and outside directors. Firm performance was operationalized as return on assets (operational performance) and Tobin's q (market-based performance). Panel regression analysis tested the research hypotheses. Findings: Using data from 25 restaurant firms from 2007 to 2013, the study found an insignificant impact of board composition on operational performance. However, a higher proportion of inside board members increases market-based performance. A higher proportion of outside board members decreases market-based performance. Practical implications: Supporting the basic tenets of stewardship theory, restaurant companies may consider changing the current practice of having a super-majority of outside directors and increase the inside board members. Because inside board member have greater experience with the organization and the industry, they have a better understanding of the status quo and are better able to respond to opportunities and threats in the environment. Originality/value: Considering the scarcity of research on how the board composition affects firm performance in the hospitality context, the present study is a forerunner in its exploration of the impact of inside and outside directors on restaurant firms' performance.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between national culture and best practices as recommended in country-level corporate governance codes. Design/methodology/approach: Measures for four corporate governance variables - board independence, gender composition, board leadership and meeting frequency - were collected from corporate governance codes for 55 countries. Scores from Hofstede's cultural dimensions - power distance, individualism vs collectivism, masculinity vs femininity and uncertainty avoidance - were gathered for these same countries. Average scores on the cultural dimensions were compared for groups of countries based on each of the corporate governance variables. Findings: Data analyses reveal significant relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the four characteristics of corporate governance examined in this study. Results highlight the importance of understanding cultural influences on board characteristics for companies considering international expansions or partnerships. Originality/value: While prior studies have focused on the influence of national culture at the company level, this study examines the relationship at the regulatory level through review of country-level corporate governance codes.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

The present research study contributes to the extant literature on underpricing rather uniquely by addressing the under-researched linkage of corporate governance to underpricing. The originality of this effort also lies in being one of the initial efforts of exploring governance in context of initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in Indian settings. The study comprises an empirical analysis of 404 Indian IPOs studied for their board structures and ownership attributes using IPO prospectuses. Drawing support from the signalling theory, the variables board size and board committees exhibit a significant positive relationship to the IPO returns on the listing day. In Indian markets characterized by concentrated family-owned firms, promoter ownership does work as an effective signal for investors who take cues of firm potential from ownership patterns. Corporate governance measures have a miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing of Indian IPOs and indicating that investors do not incorporate these as a major consideration in their investment decision.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The rise of accounting-related scandals has highlighted the prevalence of earnings management in financial markets. This paper offers empirical evidence on the motivations for earnings management in Malaysia public listed family firms. A sample of 100 family firms were randomly selected from Bursa Malaysia from the years 2010 to 2014, which resulted in 500 observations in total. The results indicate that the equity ownership held by a controlling family is associated with the earnings management in the firm, since the controlling family has greater power and rights in decision-making. However, the involvement of the controlling family as board of directors is not associated with earnings management in the family firm, since the non-executive member of the board will become the chairman to oversee and monitor the business operations of the family firm. The indirect ownership of the controlling family in family firms does not provide greater opportunity for them to manage earnings through direct equity shares held by other family members because they have limited power through indirect ownership.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Manuscript Type: Article/Review. Research Question/Issue: This study presents the results of a longitudinal content analysis of governance articles published in both CGIR and other leading management outlets. Our aim with this review is to identify problematic areas, as well as opportunities to improve the methodological rigor of governance studies. Research Findings/Insights: We examine key design aspects of corporate governance articles. We identify and compare trends (1) over time and (2) across publishing outlets. Specifically examined are the geographic scope of samples, design characteristics (i.e., single- versus multi-year data, the use of archival, survey, experimental, and qualitative designs, data sources, and reliance on concurrent versus longitudinal data), survey response rates and the use of tests for non-response bias, the statistical analysis techniques used, reporting of results (number and proportion of hypotheses supported, non-significant, and counter-significant, use of statistical power analysis, reporting of descriptive statistics and correlations, use and significance of control variables, and endogeneity controls), and the sophistication of the models tests (i.e., mediation and moderation). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the results of the review, recommendations for academic researchers are offered in the following areas: (1) designing theoretical tests which both incorporate and go beyond main effects; (2) evaluating a research design's analytical parameters on an a priori basis to maximize reliability, validity, and the potential for publication; (3) incorporating assessment of sensitivity and robustness checks into the analysis; and (4) comprehensive reporting of results including post hoc power analysis, complete and expanded correlation matrix(es), reporting and assessing counter-results, and avoiding HARKing.

It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO's dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-a-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO-TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO's delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors.

Research Question/Issue: This research investigates the antecedents of board members' monitoring behaviors at the individual level. The main idea is that individuals who are both conscientious and identified with shareholders are those most likely to adopt monitoring behaviors. Research Findings/Insights: The study was conducted using a survey of 166 board members of a large Canadian credit union corporation. Data on monitoring behaviors were collected directly from the chairpersons of the boards they participate in. The results validate the hypothesized moderated mediation model in which perceived importance of monitoring by board members mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and actual monitoring behaviors, on the one hand, and identification with shareholders moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and the perception of the importance of monitoring, on the other hand. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By investigating the mediating effect of the perceived importance of the monitoring role in the relationship between conscientiousness and monitoring behaviors, our study provides an empirical test of the attention-based view in the context of boards of directors and thus contributes to opening the 'black box' of board behaviors. Further, by looking at the interactive effect of conscientiousness and identification with shareholders, our study brings new insights into the motivational drivers of directors' monitoring behaviors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study invites practitioners in charge of board members' recruitment and selection to reconsider their practices in order to target individuals demonstrating high levels of conscientiousness. It also highlights the importance of implementing board cultures that value conscientiousness and emphasize shareholders' interests. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

We examine market reactions to the stock options backdating scandal in a slightly unusual way, but focusing on firms who were not perceived to have had a backdating concern, but were instead linked to firms who did have a backdating concern. These linkages can be found via board interlocks and the roles those directors perform. In addition we examine the linkages which occur from shared professional services firms, such as auditors and outside legal counsel. That these potential conduits are available is not in question, but rather, do investors perceive the conduits are used to pass along information about backdating stock options? We then ask if affiliation with dominant audit and legal services firms ameliorates or exacerbates those investor market reactions. We find that firms linked to the scandalized firms also face negative reactions, which are worsened when they also are serviced by professional services firms who are themselves are also linked to the managerial practice.

This study examines how behavioral processes among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs affect the comprehensiveness of non-executive director selection planning and evaluation. Building on a theory-building multiple-case study, our findings indicate that comprehensiveness is based on three key factors: (1) task-related mutual and collective interactions in nominating committees, (2) board chair leadership in structuring selection processes with high facilitation skills, and (3) the level and timing of information exchange between CEOs and board chairs. Furthermore, we highlight the interconnectedness and temporal embeddedness of these behavioral processes. Our study contributes to a more holistic understanding of non-executive director selections and provides new insights into the complex and interwoven social dynamics among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs.

Many Australian not-for-profit boards face a crisis in attracting suitably qualified board members who are willing and able to take on governance roles in increasingly complex not-for-profit business environments. These boards often do not have the expertise, time or resources to conduct the necessary succession planning. As a result, succession planning for board directors is not a widespread practice. This study investigated the attitudes of 88 directors of not-for-profit organisations to succession planning. Results revealed that existing board directors perceive succession planning in the two dimensions of practices and value. Directors evaluated their participation in the succession planning process depending on the referent group of CEO, management team and board of directors, and not on their level of involvement in the succession planning process. Directors recognise the positive relationship between succession planning and board effectiveness. Implications for not-for-profit organisations and human resources functions are addressed.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the link between board of director composition and firm performance. Specifically, the paper argues that board political experience influences the firm's internationalization strategy as directors with significant political experience provide guidance, resources, and network access that enhance the firm's international presence. The authors also posit that board political connections would be more helpful for firms operating in high-regulation industries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the predictions using data from 156 large US firms. Data on directors' background were gathered from SEC proxy filings, while data pertaining to internationalization were obtained from Compustat and Mergent Online databases. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was employed to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The findings provide strong support for the positive relationship between board political experience and the degree of firm internationalization. Contrary to the authors' predictions, the level of industry regulation does not seem to significantly affect this relationship. Research limitations/implications: Firms aggressively pursuing international strategy could benefit from having directors on their board with robust political experience. One of the limitations of the study is that the types of international activities for firms is not specified in the study as it might be in the form of joint-venture capacity, strategic alliances or for firms that might be born-global. Originality/value: This study makes original contribution to the on-going research on board political activity and firm performance through internationalization strategy. The findings suggest that having directors' with political experience is an important asset in influencing firm's corporate strategy. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Boards of directors are assumed to exercise three key accountability roles - control, monitoring and oversight roles. By researching one board type - investment fund boards - and the power relations around those boards, the purpose of this paper is to show that such boards are not capable of operating the three key roles assumed of them. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 25 in-depth interviews and a focus group session with investment fund directors applying a grounded theory methodology. Findings: Because of their unique position of power, the authors find that fund promoter organisations (that establish and attract investors to the funds) exercise control and monitoring roles. As a result, contrary to prior assumptions, oversight is the primary role of investment fund boards, rather than the control role or monitoring role associated with corporate boards. The findings can be extended to other board-of-director contexts in which boards (e.g. subsidiary boards, boards of state-owned entities) have legal responsibility but limited power because of power exercised by other parties such as large shareholders. Practical implications: Shareholders and regulators generally assume boards exercise control and monitoring roles. This can lead to an expectations gap on the part of shareholders and regulators who may not consider the practical realities in which boards operate. This expectations gap compromises the very objective of governance - investor protection. Originality/value: Based on interviews with investment fund directors, the authors challenge the control-role theory of investment fund boards of directors. Building on our findings, and following subsequent conceptual engagement with the literature, the authors differentiate control, monitoring and oversight roles, terms which are often used interchangeably in prior research. The authors distinguish between the three terms on the basis of the level of influence implied by each. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

A board of directors consists of a set of key personnel that hold vital positions in a company. Based on the premise of the resource dependence theory, we explore the association between board diversity and innovation performance in Malaysia. The sample consists of 220 companies from the industrial product sector of the main market of Bursa Malaysia for the financial year 2013. Board diversity is represented by a comprehensive score that includes age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, education, tenure, area of experience and directorship in other companies. Results of the regression analysis show that there is a positive association between board diversity and innovation performance. Our findings contribute to the policy involving the diversity of corporate boards by suggesting that policy, such as one of gender diversity in Malaysia, is expanded to include multi-dimensional aspects of board diversity that better represent the economic, legal and cultural environment of a country.

This paper examines the link between firm past performance and the appointment of new CEOs in the Indonesian publicly traded family-owned firms. Further, we also investigate the effect of family member composition in the board of directors and board of commissioners on the CEO succession. This study encompasses 148 succession events gathered from ORBIS database for the period of 2006-2015. Employing a logistic regression, results show that the appointment of new CEOs is generally affected by firm past performance and family member composition in the board of directors. Negative past performance would lead firms to select non-family member. Further, the more the number the family members sitting on the board of directors, the higher the probability family-owned firms to select the new CEO inside family member.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that women who sit on boards of directors, as well as women that are part of an interlocking directorate, have on corporate performance. The investigation is placed within the literature on human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: A director data set for over 32,000 firms based in the USA, composed of 6,218 women and 54,932 men, is utilized. From this, regression and network analysis were utilized. Findings: It is found that female directors' participation in interlocking directorates translates into greater corporate performance when compared to simply examining female representation on boards of directors. Additionally, women involved in interlocks translated into greater corporate performance when compared to men. These results support the resource dependency approach. Practical/implications: Results of this study suggest that when considering female directors, corporate performance is enhanced when female directors already sit on the boards of other firms. Originality/value: This study highlights external network connections to differentiate between human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors.

This paper reviews a recent literature with regard to the relationship between board composition and performance of listed firms in Nigeria. To achieve the objective of the study, reviews of some prior empirical research on corporate governance, performance, and the theories were examined. The recent studies reveal that inconsistent findings were still found in the previous studies on the characteristics of corporate governance literature. Therefore, the need to measure the link between the board independent and performance will for a long time continue to remain an interesting study area. This paper, therefore, recommends that the researchers should try and avoid the mistake of the prior studies by over-reliance on the direct relationship between board independent and firm performance. The study also recommends the use of board professional knowledge and experience as a moderator and board diversity as a mediator to determine the nexus between the board composition and firm performance and to avoid the use of only one single theory of corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. The use of primary survey based methodology on the causal effect of the relationship between board composition and the performance would be a key advantage in the area of CG.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

This paper examines whether board function is associated with improved corporate performance. Path analysis is used to investigate the direct and indirect links between four performance variables and organization capital. A hypothesis is developed based upon the incorporation of knowledge-based resources. The idea is that the board of directors has monitoring and consultation functions, propelling organizational development. We use panel data with random effects for 1,355 firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2001 to 2012. The two-stage leastsquares method is used to explore the mediating effect among board function, organization capital and corporate performance. Both an aggregated model and the EP model are investigated specifying both a direct link and a mediated link with organization capital. It is concluded that the governance effect has a direct influence in the relationship between board function and corporate governance, and that organization capital is significantly associated with the performance variables. In terms of the counselling function of the board, inside directors are significantly related to dynamic capacity, which improves corporate performance for the long run.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

This study examines the effect of gender diversity and board diversity on Malaysian firm performance. This study is different from other studies because instead of using publicly listed companies, it uses 3,735 private companies over 2009-2014. We find that gender has no significant effect on the firm performance but firm's characteristics such as firm age, firm's size, liquidity, and leverage have significant effects on the firm performance. Our research further indicates that ethnic diversity in the board of directors may give better performance to companies. This research implies two important findings for the policy makers. First, the encouragement of gender equality to private companies by policy maker may fail as it does not have any impact. Second, policy maker should not consider ethnic diversity in the board as part of policy because it may reduce the firm performance. (c) 2017 by De La Salle University.

This monitoring role of board of director has enthralled augmented interest in present era because of sophisticated breakdown of firms such as Enron and WorldCom and successive corporate governance reforms. The efficacy of the observing role of directors relies upon many aspects like capabilities and experience of board individuals, participation in different directorships, their level of share-possession and the kind of compensation plan utilized. The checking part performed by the directors is an imperative corporate governance control component. Corporate Governance subject gained momentum after the glut of corporate scandals worldwide and collapse of the major corporate giants highlights the substance of corporate governance issues in last few decades. Since 1961, many researchers have studied relations between corporate attributes and disclosures in their yearly reports. Vast literature on corporate governance reveals its three eminent instruments-board, disclosure and ownership pattern. There is no accord among authors on the result of these components of corporate governance on company's performance. The present study has made an endeavour to review the whether corporate governance mechanism and firm performance are related to each other. Studies on company disclosure proved the link among corporate governance disclosures and performance of companies. Discoveries have determinedly indicated organization size, profitability and listing status to be prevalently aligned with disclosure levels, while blended outcomes have been accounted for leverage, liquidity, audit firm size. In India, corporate governance frameworks are still in transformative phase so the discoveries of the present review will be valuable for other recently changed and globalized economies.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Purpose: This paper aims to assess the measurement of the Corporate Governance (CG) quality of Islamic Banks (IBs) and its effect on financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: In the applied part of this study, a sample of 44 IBs operating in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were investigated according to information provided by the national central bank websites of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. To measure the governance quality, CG-index was constructed based on three sub-indices which are the Board of Directors (BOD), the Audit Committees (AC) and the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) indices. Findings: Findings revealed that CG quality of IBs in GCC countries adhere to 74 per cent of the attributes addressed in the CG-index. The results also showed that IBs in GCC countries valued the effectiveness of SSB much more than the conventional CG mechanisms. Using multiple regression models, findings suggested no statistically significant relation between CG quality and financial performance which would imply that good CG had an insignificant association with high performance in GCC IBs. Originality/value: The current paper may serve to assist IBs stakeholders to better understand the CG practices of IBs. In addition, the observed insignificant relation between the quality of CG practices and performance should sensitize the IBs regulators in the GCC countries to the necessity of improving the existing CG requirements.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Using the Heckman two-stage method, this study empirically investigates whether board directors' work experience in government and multinational corporations (MNCs), as well as the proportion of outside directors affects export propensity and export performance based on a sample of Korean firms. We find that the Korean firms with former government officials on the board are more likely to engage in exporting, although there is no empirical evidence supporting export performance. The findings also show that firms with former MNC employees on the board demonstrate higher levels of export propensity and export performance. Similarly, firms with a higher proportion of outside directors exhibit a higher level of export propensity and export performance. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors in Korean firms' first stage of internationalization and provide new insights into which type of board members can benefit their firms in terms of export propensity and export performance.

The aim of this research is to examine what impact female institutional directors on boards have on corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors who may or may not maintain business relations with the companies on whose corporate boards they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors on boards and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors on boards enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold on boards (11.72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors on boards also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12.71 % on boards), above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Despite the growing interest in leaders' role in the turnaround process, there is a paucity of research on founder-CEOs' role in achieving successful turnaround among declining firms. In this study, using insights from the organizational identification literature, we argue that founder-CEOs play an important role in turnaround attempts due to their strong organizational commitment and psychological attachment to the declining firm as well as the relative absence of agency problem issues common among their non-founder counterparts. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from a matched pair sample of 142 US firms that experienced performance decline, we found that founder-CEO leadership significantly increases turnaround success in declining firms. We also found that, among turnaround firms, those led by founder-CEOs tend to put more emphasis on market-based turnaround strategies, such as new product introductions, and less emphasis on retrenchment actions, such as divestments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings contribute to corporate turnaround research by providing a more nuanced view of leaders' role in the turnaround process by specifically exploring the effect of founder CEO leadership. Furthermore, this study contributes to the turnaround literature by highlighting the strategic choices of founder-CEO-led firms and how these choices influence successful turnaround. Finally, by introducing organizational identification perspective, this study provides additional theoretical explanation of leadership antecedents of successful turnarounds. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The findings of this study suggest that boards of directors, shareholders, and consultants who often participate in turnaround management should carefully consider retaining founder-CEOs and endorsing their leadership during the turnaround process. Further, the findings provide turnaround specialists and other stakeholders with further understanding of not only the importance of product market strategies in the turnaround process but also founder-CEOs' role in fostering such strategies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the diverse literature on board demographic diversity and to provide avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive literature review of theoretical and empirical studies published in leading management journals from 1989 to 2015. Findings: The literature review revealed several aspects that are related to board demographic diversity. These aspects have been classified into: definitions and types of board diversity, dimensions of board demographic diversity, measurement and outcomes of board diversity, reasons for existing conflicting empirical findings about the relationship between board diversity and firm dynamics, and research on mediators and moderators. Originality/value: Issues pertaining to board demographic diversity identified in this paper have theoretical and practical implications, and include avenues for future research.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This paper seeks to review the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between bank governance and performance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the existing research and offering guidance for investors and regulators on the major points of consensus and disagreement among researchers on this issue. Although the question of what determines the levels of firms' performance, with special emphasis on the role of the corporate governance, has long been the subject of substantial academic research, it gained increased attention in the banking industry in the last decade due to a series of financial scandals and, more recently, to the global financial crisis. In fact, in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, bank corporate governance mechanisms received heightened attention, accompanied by the renewed interest in the degree of effectiveness of such mechanisms, and their impact on performance. Given the vast number of influences on corporate performance, such as the numerous characteristics of the board of directors, there is an abundant literature on the determinants of performance. Thus, this paper tries to bring together this diverse body of knowledge into a coherent whole. Banks have unique attributes that interfere with the way in which the usual corporate governance mechanisms work. Thus, the main differences between banks and non-financial firms, which justify that some of the regularities found in the literature on the relationship between a set of corporate governance mechanisms and performance do not hold for banks, are also analysed. Then, we extensively review the literature on the board of directors and its impact on performance in the financial crisis and non-financial crisis periods. Finally, we also survey the (very) scarce research on the relationship between board characteristics and bank failures. (c) 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

The study investigates demographic diversity, cognitive diversity and internal diversity within Islam among top-level management of firms and their impacts on the financial performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim and non-Muslim women and Islamic religious diversity on corporate boards are investigated. Even though numerous organisations desire to be socially diverse, the significance of diversity for organisational performance remains uncertain. Are profitable companies inclined to improve board diversity or do other characteristics of the company contribute to firm performance? Does the participation of Muslim and non-Muslim women on corporate boards affect firm performance? Does internal diversity within Islam affect firm performance? Data from 330 Malaysian-listed companies in eleven full fledged sectors were used for the period from 2009 to 2013. This study employed econometrics methodology from panel data analysis to fill the research gap in the current management literature. This study used the interaction approach to examine empirically diverse corporate boards and their impacts on firm performance. This discussion included: (1) a combination of gender diversity and ethnic diversity and (2) a combination of gender diversity and foreign participation. The findings suggest that demographic, cognitive and internal diversity within Islam are significant predictors of a firm's financial performance. Ethnic women on boards have a significant and negative impact on firm performance. Hence, companies having high profits are more accountable for encouraging diversity among top-level management.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the ownership of institutional shareholders, the proportion of non-executive members, the percentage of ownership of major shareholders, the duality of the tasks of chief executive officer and chairman of the board of director, financial leverage, the amount of the remuneration of the board of director, the company's life and the amount of export on internet financial reporting. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, the authors surveyed the 301 listed companies on Tehran Stock Exchange in 2015. The statistical method used to test the hypothesis of the study was cross-sectional data. Findings: The results indicate the negative impact of ratio of non-executive members and the positive impact of financial leverage, size, liquidity and the life of the company in stock, over internet financial reporting. Originality/value: The current study is almost the first study which is conducted in a developing country, and the results may helpful to the other developing nations.

Upper echelons (UE) theory posits that organisational performance reflects the personal values and cognitive frames of the top management team (TMT) and, crucially, that greater heterogeneity in individual backgrounds of senior executives leads to better outcomes. However, often missing from this research is a more developed account of how this relationship between the characteristics of TMTs and performance is also mediated by internal conditions within organisations. In this paper we begin to address this deficiency focusing on the mediating impact of employee satisfaction and the styles and practices of line managers. Looking at the empirical case of English National Health Services acute care hospital trusts, we use a multiple mediation model to analyse the relationship between board heterogeneity, performance and these two (internal) organisational factors. A variance-based structural equation modelling approach (partial least square) is applied to a sample of 102 boards of directors. First, the results lend support to the UE hypothesis that there is a positive impact of board heterogeneity and hos-pital-level performance. Second, the analysis shows that the relationship heterogeneity-performance is positively influenced by: (a) the styles and practices of line managers; (b) the levels of staff satisfaction; and by their mutually reinforcing roles.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The present research is focused on studying the effect of board director's characteristics on the real earnings management (management sales manipulation proxy) measured by the abnormal level of operating cash flows. Our empirical study has been conducted on a sample of 29 Tunisian-listed companies over the period ranging from 2009 to 2013. The study finds a negative impact of board size, board independence, and board meetings on the sales manipulation. Concerning the CEO chairman duality, the results show no association with the level of sales management. This leads us to conclude that the board of directors seems to have a significant effect on delimiting the sales management practice. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

Purpose: This study aims to explore how the economic recession and some corporate governance (CG) provisions can affect the performance of Italian gambling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across different business segments. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel sample of 2,135 observations before and during the global financial crisis. Specifically, the roles of ownership, boards of directors, chief executive officer gender and gambling business segments are investigated in the Italian gambling market. Findings: Ownership concentration has a negative relationship with the performance of foreigner- and financial-owned firms, while boards exert a positive role on performance. Interestingly, the financial crisis does not impact the performance of Italian gambling SMEs and some business segments, such as bingo, perform even better during the crisis. Research limitations/implications: Further investigations should analyze the role of single games on firm performance. The consumer- and firm-level examinations offer very different perspectives and scholars should be aware of this when investigating the gambling industry. Practical implications: This study might help both policymakers and other gambling firms, such as casinos, to better understand which appropriate CG model should be adopted and how it can positively influence performance, especially in recessionary times. Originality/value: This study contributes to studies on hospitality and tourism by focusing on the complementary role of gambling SMEs with respect to casinos. It also increases knowledge on the role of CG in privately owned gambling firms, which thus far has been scantly investigated by scholars. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the demographic diversity at top-level management and its impact on the performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim diversity on corporate boards is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Although many organisations aspire to be socially diverse, diversity's consequences for organisational performance remain unclear. This study specifies the whole distinct mechanism and measures it independently, bridging as the demographic diversity among the board of directors (BODs) and bonding as the firm's financial performance. To maintain the homogeneity factor, the empirical analysis has been confined to 12 fully fledged sectors and 529 Malaysian listed firms out of 798 firms selected on the basis of judgmental sampling during the period of 2013. The paper applies the correlation matrix and linear regression model to justify this phenomenon. Findings: The empirical findings suggest that gender diversity (Muslim and Non-Muslim women) is positively significant with firm performance with regards to management, shareholders and market perspectives. It means that both Muslim and non-Muslim women are contributing to firm performance. Ethnic diversity (minority) and Muslim diversity (majority) have no impact on firm performance. On the other hand, interaction variables are positively significant with firm performance. It means that majority and minorities are essential for corporate boards to produce a greater performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research could include more variables such as director's age profile and foreign participation as well as other types of diversities, such as cognitive diversity and corporate diversity. In addition, another possible extension could be the investigation of diversity issues between small scale and large or high and low-profit firms. The findings provide insightful information to firms, as this study suggests that the diverse corporate boards can enhance firm performance. Originality/value: In recent years, diversity issues have been examined with regard to firm performance of the listed companies. Whilst extensive literature exists on diversity issues, this issue is still under debate and has had inconsistent results. The paper attempts to fill the gap in the existing literature, discuss the empirically diverse corporate boards with the interaction approach and impact on the firm performance.

This article investigates whether the presence of advisory directors and monitoring directors varies across firm life cycle stages. We follow a parsimonious life cycle proxy based on the predicted behaviour of operating, investing and financing cash flows across the different life cycle stages that result from firm performance and the allocation of resources. Using an Australian sample, this study shows that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have more advisory directors. With respect to the demand for monitoring directors, we find that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have fewer monitoring directors on the board. We contribute to the literature on boards of directors by documenting that firms choose an optimal board structure based on their economic characteristics. JEL Classification: D22, G38, M14.

O conceito de diversidade e entendido de maneira ampla, incluindo nao apenas a variedade de genero e etnia, mas tambem a diversidade em relacao aos aspectos culturais, sociais e profissionais. O objetivo desta pesquisa e contribuir para o entendimento da influencia do conselho de administracao nas politicas corporativas a partir da analise dos impactos da diversidade do conselho nas decisoes de politica financeira das empresas. Os resultados desta pesquisa sugerem que essa diversidade propicia melhor monitoramento por parte do conselho em relacao aos administradores e esta relacionada positivamente com o endividamento da empresa, em linha com os efeitos da reducao do entrincheiramento gerencial por meio de maior monitoramento.

Board diversity has been the recurring theme for discussions both in the academic and corporate environments. The concept of diversity is broad and encompasses not only gender and ethnic variety, but also the diversity of cultural, social, and professional aspects. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of the influence of company boards on corporate policies, by analyzing the effects of board diversity on firms' financial/ capital structure decisions. The results suggest that board diversity improves monitoring effectiveness and is positively related with firm leverage, in line with the effects of reduction of managerial entrenchment by means of stronger monitoring.

Firm performance is a major concern for all organizations and involves a multitude of antecedents. Reducing environmental uncertainty and dependency through the use of strategic actions in the resource dependency theory (RDT) framework and enhancing work practices through high performance work systems (HPWS) lead to higher levels of firm performance. We reveal the interconnectivity between RDT and HPWS and develop propositions as to how components of HPWS positively moderate the relationship between firm performance and the environmental uncertainty-reducing strategic actions proposed by RDT such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, boards of directors, political action, and executive succession.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of corporate governance practices on firms' financial performance, as measured by comprehensive income (CI). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 237 firms from the Standards & Poor (S&P) 500 index during the years 2004-2009, multivariate statistical analyses are conducted to confirm the authors' main hypothesis. Findings: The results indicate that having high levels of corporate governance culture has a positive impact on a measure of firms' financial performance, namely, CI. Furthermore, they indicate a positive correlation between a higher percentage of external directors and financial performance, and a negative relationship between number of board meetings and financial performance. Originality/value: The main contribution of this research is that good corporate governance strategies deliver superior financial performance for businesses in terms of CI. This serves as a method of value creation, which is the ultimate goal of a business. In addition to the use of CI as an indicator of financial performance, a unique measure of corporate governance level is tested. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity. Implications for future research on corporate governance and managerial and policy takeaways complete this article. (c) 2018, (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The declining financial health of public pension systems is increasingly becoming a budgetary concern for many state and local governments. While the academic literature has identified several factors behind the growth in unfunded state and local public pension liabilities, there is mixed evidence on how the composition of a pension system's board of trustees affects a pension's financial health. This article contributes to this literature by measuring how public pension board composition affects fund financial health as measured by state bond ratings. With a panel dataset of state pensions between 2001 and 2014 our results indicate that elected board members are consistently associated with lower bond ratings (and thus higher borrowing costs) while appointed and ex-officio board members are associated with higher bond ratings. These results are robust to a number of specifications. (c) 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of corporate governance (focused on some key mechanisms as board size, board independence, managerial ownership, institutional ownership, and chief executive officer duality) on financial analysts' behavior in US. Results from panel data analysis for 294 US listed firms observed from 2007 to 2014 show that several attributes of the board of directors and audit committee have no effects on the number of analysts who are following the firm and the properties of analysts' earnings forecasts. Findings also suggest that firms with independent and large boards and blockholders ownership benefit of more analyst following. In addition, it is proven that analysts' earnings forecasts are optimistic and more accurate for companies where blockholder ownership, either by managers or external entities have larger quoted spreads but of lower quality for the ones which have greater independent board members and institutional investor's holding.

Despite that fact that Iraq has gone very far in the liberalization of women, Iraqi board of directors is still dominated by men. However, gender diversity is one of the largest concepts of board diversity and a major issue within corporate governance where several studies seek to discover the influence of diversity on firm performance. This article aims at examining the effect of women representation on firm performance of Iraqi listed firms using panel regression analysis. The empirical results of this paper provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between female directors and firm performance as measured by Return on Assets while no relationship with the Tobin's q. The important policy implication of this finding is that the Iraqi Stock Exchange and Iraqi Security Commission should incorporate gender diversity in CG practices and encourage women directorship in Iraq.

In recent years, the US and the EU have pursued markedly different agendas in the pursuit of board gender diversity. The EU has taken a more pro-active governmental approach of mandated quotas, whereas the US is relying largely on the endogenous mechanism of shareholder diversity proposals. Despite their obvious allure as a means of bringing about rapid change, evidence is mounting that board gender diversity quotas may yield various deleterious side effects; and quotas may not be as successful in their core aim of promoting gender diversity as initial broad statistical measures indicate. In this paper we critique the expanding EU quota regime, and consider US shareholder proposals as an alternative change mechanism for improving gender diversity in corporate boards. As an alternative to quotas, diversity resolutions are often dismissed as ineffective because the vast majority fail to formally pass (with a failure rate close to 95%). However, on closer inspection, this 'failure' actually results in success. Contrary to the conventional 'folk' wisdom -- in the quest to promote gender diversity on corporate boards, the endogenous (US) mechanism of board diversity proposals has, to date, resulted in similar increases in gender diversity as the exogenous (EU) mechanism of government-mandated gender quotas. Furthermore, the former mechanism is more consistent with recent 'third-wave' feminist theory. We conclude with the policy recommendation that, rather than quotas, the EU should focus on removing the regulatory barriers that inhibit shareholder democracy.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper attempts to extend the concept of 'bundle of governance mechanisms' and analyses the dynamics of various governance mechanisms in relation to each other. Further, this paper seeks to answer if it is justified to exercise a huge reliance on board monitoring alone while designing or analysing the governance structure of a firm. This paper uses the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) approach to analyse the various hierarchical relationships based on the relative driving power and dependence of various monitoring mechanisms. The findings suggest that a huge reliance on board monitoring is justified to an extent as it has the driving power to strengthen other governance mechanisms. However, the relationship between board monitoring and firm performance is moderated by other governance mechanisms like product market competition and ownership concentration. Thus, board monitoring alone should not be considered as a benchmark to assess the quality of the governance structure of a firm. (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Transparent and effective corporate governance positively influences the financial stability of the company: it increases the investment attractiveness and reduces the cost of lending. For Russia, this problem is relatively new. And at the moment, corporate management in the manufacturing industry continues to be characterized by a high concentration of ownership and a combination of ownership and management functions. In this paper, using logistic regression we investigate the impact of corporate governance factors and sector expectations on a negative net worth of the companies in the period 2011-2015. The results showed, in particular, the probability of a negative company's net worth is higher, the lower the index of business confidence in the industry; the presence of agency problem; the smaller the number of member in the board of directors; the higher concentration of ownership; and, if company is not privately owned or joint stock company. Robustness of the coefficients of the final specification was confirmed. (c) 2018 New Economic Association. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between selected components of corporate governance and financial performance of listed companies in Bursa Malaysia. In this study, the most critical components of corporate governance including board independence, board size, board expertise, audit committee size, audit committee independence, and audit committee expertise, have been examined as the independent variables that influence the financial performance of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. This study used a sample of 150 non-financial listed companies in Malaysia. This study differs than previous studies that separately study the effect of either the board characteristics or the audit committee characteristics. This study concerns on the combined effect of both, board of directors and audit committee, about return on equity. The study is based on companies' data for the year 2014. Regression analysis is conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science Version 22 (SPSS 22), and the outcomes of this study show significant and positive relationships between all the independent variables and financial performance of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The study ended up with positive suggestions based on the limitations that have been faced while conducting this study. (c) 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

This case explores the context in which decisions related to the composition of the board of directors are made at a company with a strong, participatory culture and strong values of accountability, responsibility, and community. This case study seeks an in-depth understanding of a 100% ESOP company's (Carris Reels, Inc.) values, culture, and processes related to broad-based employee participation in decision-making and governance of the company. Data were collected from formal and informal interviews and discussions with Carris Reels' employees, observation, and company archi-val data, including newsletters, meeting minutes, and announcements. Goals may be sufficiently different at highly participatory, majority employee-owned ESOP companies such that regulatory guidelines for board structure for public or privately held companies that are not employee-owned should be evaluated in the context of that company's stakeholders. A trend toward external members for boards of directors should be given careful consideration in the case of majority ESOP companies whose employee-owned and governed status is central to the company's vision. This case study provides an in-depth look at a company's board of direc-tors' composition-related decision-making in the context of broad-based participatory processes and the desire to maintain a profitable and fully employee-owned and governed enterprise.

Establishing effective corporate governance is most important at the time of an initial public offering (IPO), because the IPO represents a significant step by a company toward moving to the public arena. This chapter focuses on three characteristics that help describe structure of the board of directors at the time of IPO: board size (i.e., the number of members on a board), board independence (i.e., the proportion of non-executive members on the board), and board leadership (i.e., the choice to overlap the roles of CEO and chairman of the board). The chapter presents empirical evidence from a sample of 969 companies that went public between 1995 and 2011 in France, Germany, and Italy that shows how these companies differ from their US and UK counterparts.

Purpose: Using a data set of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, this paper aims to empirically assess the effects of ownership structure and board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, this study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, two stage least squares (2SLS) regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, together with a two-tier board system and no chief executive officer duality, the stronger the firm's performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holders' ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership are all positively related to firm value. Research limitations/implications: Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value: First, unlike most of the previous literature on Western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies used a single indicator of firm performance, this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using 2SLS estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Purpose: This study aims to link environmental disclosure quality (EDQ) to firm performance and examine the moderating role of board independence in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory and stakeholder theory, the authors developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 720 firm-year observations collected from 120 Iranian companies over six years between 2011 and 2016. In this paper, they conducted static and dynamic panel data analysis. Findings: After correcting for endogeneity bias, the results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between EDQ and firm performance. The results also showed that board independence significantly reinforces the positive effect of EDQ on performance, and firms with more independent board members are involved environmental disclosure for improved performance. This is consistent with agency theory, which posits that a more independent board of directors can better monitor the CEO and reduce incentives for pursuing personal interests, which in turn improves performance. The results are robust after performing sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: This paper takes the perspective of corporate governance to empirically examine the effect of EDQ on firm performance. This study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that board independence moderates the effects of EDQ on firm performance. Practical implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. Originality/value: The study adds value to the understanding of the effect of the EDQ on performance and how board independence influences this relationship, particularly in an emerging economy like Iran.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study investigates the effect of both family-centered goals and family board representation (family member representation on the board of directors) on family firm capital structure. Based on a sample of 327 Belgian family SMEs, our findings show that family-centered goals indirectly affect the total debt rate through family board representation. More specifically, the results indicate that this mediating effect holds primarily for the short-term (vs. long-term) debt rate and for the financial (vs. nonfinancial) debt rate. Taken together, our findings suggest that the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective is relevant and fruitful to explain debt decisions in family firms. Our findings contribute to family business literature and enable scholars and practitioners to gain a better understanding of family firm capital structure decisions.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

The most successful and longest-enduring family firms are progressively encouraging the active presence of women on their corporate boards. Why is the presence of women on boards so important for family firms? And how can policy makers and controlling owners encourage the active presence of women on family business corporate boards? By integrating the literature on women in governance and the goals of family businesses, we take a step toward increasing shareholder awareness of the economic and noneconomic benefits that women can bring to the family business boardroom. Using theory and empirical evidence, we show that the presence of women on corporate boards can be instrumental for the controlling owners of a family business to achieve prosperity and success, to preserve family cohesion, and to improve the reputation of the family and business simultaneously. Furthermore, we discuss the socioemotional and economic ramifications of excluding women from the family business board of directors. We conclude with four practical recommendations for encouraging the active presence of women on family business boards. (c) 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Will adding women to the board of directors reduce firm gender pay disparities? Our research suggests 'no' ... and 'yes.' It is not a matter of simply adding more women to the board or integrating women into key board committees that moves the needle. If firms really want to stimulate change through board diversity, then they need to empower female directors and place them in key leadership roles. We find that women's integration on the board of directors and on the compensation committee has no significant impact on lessening the compensation gap within the top executive team. However, when women influence compensation decisions through service as the chair of the compensation committee, the top executive compensation gap is diminished. Our analysis relies on a dataset built by the authors of all top management team executives and board members from the S&P 500 from 2009-2013. We test three mechanisms that may enable women to overcome limitations with respect to pay equity: (i) integration, (ii) direct decision making and (iii) influence. Our findings suggest that not all types of power are equal; the more direct influence women have over compensation decisions, the smaller the compensation gap. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

This study examined the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on financial performance of Indian hotel companies. The analysis was based on balanced panel data over a period ranging from 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 for 30 Indian hotel companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The study investigated three aspects of corporate governance mechanisms namely: the board of directors (size, composition, and diligence), audit committee (size, composition, and diligence) and institutional ownership, whereas financial performance was measured according to three common measures, return on assets (ROA), net interest margin (NIM), and earnings per share (EPS). The results confirm that board size, board diligence, audit committee size, and institutional ownership have a significant impact on ROA, while board composition, audit committee composition, audit committee diligence and company age have an insignificant effect on ROA. With respect to NIM model, the results indicate that board composition, board diligence, audit committee composition, institutional ownership and size of the company have a significant impact on NIM, while board size, audit committee size, and audit committee diligence have an insignificant effect on NIM. In terms of the EPS model, the results suggest that board size, board composition, board diligence, audit committee composition, and company age thus have a significant impact on EPS, while audit committee size, audit committee diligence, and institutional ownership have somewhat of an insignificant influence with EPS.

Next to value creation, the value protection function of the Board of Directors is a widely accepted fact. Nevertheless, the current literature struggles to show a positive impact of the Board Value Protection (BVP) on firm performance. We use the decision rights model of board functions and argue the difference between board member roles (insider vs independent) and functions, to isolate the BVP from other director functions. By using the German context as a natural setting, we can isolate the BVP and show how it evolves with the firm lifecycle and owner motivations. Based on a sample of 446 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 1995 to 2015, our results show that the importance of BVP in young firms decreases with age, increases in mature firms and that this effect is stronger in family firms.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

The awareness of board of directors' role in enhancing firms' financial performance has increased noticeably over the last years. Previous studies, however, have covered a traditional set of characteristics (i.e. board independence, board size and board meetings), but few studies are conducted to explore the impact of a new set of characteristics (i.e. political connections, number of foreign members and busy directors) on banks' performance within the context of emerging markets. This study was motivated to combine the new set of characteristics with the traditional ones to gauge the impact of them on financial performance. Employing an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique on a sample of 14 Jordanian banks listed at the Amman Stock Exchange between 2013 and 2017 revealed that the only variable that has a significant positive impact on financial performance is board size. Busy directors have not obtained the sufficient knowledge and experience or at least they lacked the required time to enhance performance. Politically connected directors as well as foreign members were a stumbling block in the way to positively improve performance. Board meetings and independence were found to be insignificantly associated with return on assets. In a nutshell, the Jordanian regulators need to devote more efforts to revise the suggested characteristics related to boards of directors; since the current composition of boards has been presented as a weak monitoring tool to fulfil principals' goals through enhancing banks' performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what board characteristics affect companies in periods of financial distress (FD) among non-financial Brazilian firms and examine which model best fits to predict FD. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises data from 2010 to 2016 of the non-financial Brazilian firms listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange. To measure this relationship, a conditional logistic regression is performed. Findings: A U-shaped relationship between the size of the board of directors (BD) and FD is found in all models, indicating an optimal number of six members in the BD during the period of FD. However, board characteristics (related to composition and directors' independence) are insufficient to align the shareholders' interests and unsuitable for avoiding or even reducing FD in firms when other factors are neglected. Furthermore, the results reveal what variables provide the best-fitting models to predict FD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates how the composition of the BD affects the FD likelihood in the Brazilian context. The findings are potentially of interest to researchers and practitioners since this paper contributes to the growing literature on the influence of corporate governance mechanisms in periods of FD and the understanding of its prediction models.

Purpose -- This chapter aims to evaluate the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards of directors and its impact on firm financial performance. Design/Methodology/Approach -- This study utilized both a systematic review and a meta-analysis, using a sample of 40 published studies, which gleaned financial indicator and observation data from 28 different countries. Findings -- As indicated in previous studies, while positive, there was no significant correlation found between the number of women serving on the boards of directors and firm financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications -- The heterogeneity between the various studies analyzed may present difficulties in making general conclusions. The chapter could also be subject to publication bias, as the selection criteria included may indicate a need for further peer review. Future meta-analyses should include data associated with other financial indicators. Practical Implications -- This study shows how composition ratios of men/women serving on corporate boards should be addressed in terms of proving for a greater diversity of leadership perspectives. Originality/Value -- Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have analyzed country environments as moderators for the relationship between the representation of women on corporate boards and firm financial performance. The present study evaluates possible differences between the impact of the number of women serving on the board of directors on a variety of financial indicators (ROA, ROE, and Tobin's Q).

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

This study examines the impact of mergers and acquisition deals on various executive pay schemes and factors that drive these pay rise in Africa from 2002 to 2016. We find that executives of African acquiring firms are rewarded significantly for carrying out successful M&A deals in the year of merger. Besides, pay rise is strongly impacted by the size of the deal across all various forms of executive pay. We also find that pay increases are high for executives who acquire private targets but no evidence was found to support the impact of domestic acquisitions. South African executives are rewarded more based on the market perception of the deal quality. Increase in compensation is not affected by industry classification, diversification and international operation, cross-listing and mode of payment, although there is evidence of the influence of equity mode of payment for the South African market. Further, we distinctively examine the impact of corporate governance factors on pay rise and observe that firms with larger outside board of directors' representation negatively determine executive total pay and there is no evidence that CEO's age and gender influence executive pay. However, the experience of the CEO has a very high positive influence on the level of compensation for only South African firms. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of board characteristics such as size, independence, busyness and duality on the extent of discretionary disclosures of listed Indian firms. Design/methodology/approach: A disclosure index with 110 items was constructed to assess the discretionary disclosures in the annual reports of listed firms. The study measured disclosure using 1,024 firm-year observations over 8 years from 2009 to 2016. Board characteristics such as size, independence, busyness and duality have been used in the study as indicators of corporate governance. Findings: The results indicate that while the proportion of independent directors positively impacts the extent of discretionary disclosures, boards with duality and the busyness of the director have a negative impact. The size of the board does not significantly impact the extent of disclosures. Research limitations/implications: This study examines the discretionary disclosures made only in the annual reports. Future studies could examine information disclosed in other media. Moreover, this study uses an un-weighted self-constructed disclosure index, which is subject to its inherent limitations. Originality/value: This study has examined the impact of the "busyness" of the director on the extent of disclosures. This variable has not been explored in prior studies. The significance of the variable indicates that the number of directorships held impacts the efficiency with which a director performs his/her role in the board. The study reiterates the need for firms and policymakers to focus on improving board independence and to move away from leadership structures with duality. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the association between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance measured by return on assets (ROA). The question is whether an effective corporate governance mechanism is able to increase the firm performance of Bursa and Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Klang Valley, Malaysia. The main purpose of this study is the in-depth analysis of the corporate governance mechanism and construction industry Malaysia via Bursa and CIDB. Design/methodology/approach: Following the primary and secondary data comparative approach, data are collected from 46 listed construction companies and 250 CIDB-registered SMEs for the financial year 2015. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation test are reported, and model estimation is performed using logistic regression. Findings: The empirical outcome shows that the corporate governance mechanism is significant in case of the CIDB Malaysia-registered SMEs. While, it has insignificant impact on firm's performance for Bursa Malaysia. Practical implications: This paper offers evidence specifically for Bursa and CIDB Malaysia construction industry. It can also provide guidance to the board of directors for the subscription of shares under the corporate governance measures at Bursa Malaysia. The findings also suggest that CIDB should increase awareness regarding institutional investment to assist the securities market to develop further. Originality/value: This study gives an indication about corporate governance, specifically for the CIDB-registered SMEs and Bursa Malaysia. It also discusses the matter of firm performance under the light of corporate governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether there is an association between corporate governance and stock price crash risk. A large body of literature reports that a prominent factor of stock crash risk is the managerial tendency of withholding bad news from investors due to compensation contracts and career concerns. This study aims to verify whether good governance structures (characteristics of the board of directors) help restrict these opportunistic managerial behaviors. To test the hypothesis, this study performs the logit and OLS regression model using 3,635 data of listed Korean firms from 2006 to 2015. This research provides a direct evidence for the relationship between stock crash risk and characteristics of governance, particularly the characteristics of the BODs. The findings suggest that irrespective of the size of the board, if there are independent and expert directors' present, corporate governance may have an impact on the reduction of stock price crash risk. This paper contributes by extending the literature on corporate governance. Despite the importance of board compositions, there is no prior research examining the relation between the characteristics of the BOD and stock price crash risk. (c) 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and company performance and how a board's ethical commitment can influence this relationship. Prior studies documented mixed evidence on the corporate governance and corporate performance relationship, which can be due to the influence of a board's ethical commitment and will shape the corporate governance mechanism in the company and, in turn, influence performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected data for two years, i.e. 2013 and 2014, from the biggest 500 Malaysian companies listed in the stock exchange. Corporate governance is measured based on the requirements of the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG), while a board's ethical commitment is measured based on the MCCG and various international best practices. Corporate performance is measured based on return on equity, return on assets, net profit margin, market-to-book value and TobinQ. Findings: A board's ethical commitment was found to be significant in increasing the strength of the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance. The findings are robust to the alternative performance measurements and lagged one-year corporate performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides further evidence on the importance of ethical practices to improve corporate environment and, hence, sustain a company's performance. This study, however, was conducted on only large companies with a limited data collection period. Practical implications: This study provides an indicator that the policymaker and regulatory authorities need to double their efforts in promoting and encouraging a board of directors to take a bold step in improving its ethical culture. Shareholders and investors need to use their power and rights to demand the company to improve their governance and ethical practices. Originality/value: This study is original, as it measures a board's ethical commitment from various sources of local and international best practices such as Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Norway, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey, the UK and the USA. It also contributes to the literature and theoretical understanding of the interaction between a board's ethical commitment and corporate governance on corporate performance, particularly in developing countries like Malaysia, which is scarce in the literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the composition and role of a board of directors in a family-owned microfinance institution (FO-MFI) in Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a longitudinal analysis of the board practices based on boardroom observations for the period between 2012 and 2015. The study further collected and analyzed qualitative data from interviews with board members, management, and institution staff. Findings: The findings indicate that even though external board members were appointed as a result of their diverse expertise and skills, their personal relationships with shareholders, life-cycle stage of the institution, and the nature of the industry influenced their selection. It was also found that the board played more of the service role in strategy formulation, resource mobilization, and networking, and, through that, members were also able to exercise control of the firm. Research limitations/implications: Because this paper is based on a qualitative approach, it suffers from the challenge of generalization. However, numerous research issues have been raised that require further investigation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the governance literature by showing what really happens in a family-owned firm, as it is based on a unique data set drawn from the boardroom of the FO-MFI in a context of a developing economy. This context is unique, given that most private MFIs operating as family enterprises do not have a professional board of directors. The study shows how the board contributes to a strategic direction of the firm in which the management and ownership are not separated, and the first generation is running the firm.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

This study aims to investigate the impact of board of directors' characteristics on firm performance in Jordan by focusing on the following characteristics: ownership concentration, number of board meetings, CEO duality, board size, and board independence. On the other hand, Tobin's Q was used as a proxy to measure company performance. It is believed that current study contributes significantly to the limited literature on this topic in relation to developing countries by providing evidence about the effect of corporate governance on firm performance in a developing nation. For this purpose, An empirical analysis of a dataset of all publicly traded manufacturing firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2014 was conducted by applying least squares regression analyses. This research found that ownership concentration, board meetings, and CEO duality have a significant impact on firm performance. However, the study did not find any significant effect for board size and board independence. Moreover, firm size and firm leverage as control variables were not found to have any effect on firm performance. The findings seem to suggest that for Jordanian manufacturing firms to succeed and improve their performance, they need to have a smaller sized board, more frequent board meetings and a higher percentage of board ownership and as well as CEO duality. However, the findings also indicate that board independence does not affect firm performance. (c) 2019, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

The present research article is an attempt to add something new and revalidate the influence of already existing corporate governance dimensions related to the board of directors on listing-day performance of the Indian initial public offering (IPO) firms measured through underpricing. Like other emerging market economies, firms in the Indian economy are also characterized by concentrated ownership held by an owner or a promoter in the context of the Indian corporate environment. In the backdrop of this concentrated complex ownership structure, the present study analyses the influence of the board of directors on underpricing when the appointment of such directors is largely an affair handled by such owners, whom they are given the task to monitor. The sample consists of 471 IPO firms which went public during the time period from January 2003 to December 2017. Results obtained from the regression analysis show that the board size and board committees act as information signals for Indian IPO firms having a significant and negative relation with listing-day initial excess returns. Other board-related dimensions of governance do not have significant influence on underpricing. Overall board variables have a very miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing in Indian IPO firms. (c) 2019 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.

Despite high female participation in the Thai labour market, female representation on Thai boards of directors is low. This study investigates the effect of female representation on boards of directors on the level of corporate governance in Thailand. The ordered logit regression is applied to a dataset of companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The main results show that an improvement in corporate governance is associated with a higher ratio of women appointed as board directors. Furthermore, female leadership in the form of chairpersons on executive and audit committees, two important subcommittees, strongly and positively affects corporate governance levels. Finally, the presence of women on a board has a similar effect on corporate governance as that of the presence of independent directors does. The findings offer an insightful introduction to policy makers for promoting female leadership roles on boards to enhance corporate governance. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

In this article, I investigate the effect of multiple directorships on investment efficiency. Through the study of Korean firms, this article confirms that the existence and proportion of multiple directorships were negatively related to investment efficiency. The study also found that multiple directorships were strongly related to underinvestment. Accordingly, it concludes that multiple directorships are an obstacle to directors' fulfillment as it impedes effective investment opportunities and prevents them from playing leading roles in managerial decision-making. This, in turn, affects investment efficiency negatively. (c) 2019, People and Global Business Association. All rights reserved.

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Structural sources of power have shifted dramatically in corporate America. Recently, the fracturing of the corporate interlock network threatens corporate managers' capacity to act as a unified group in support of their shared interests, potentially destroying managerialism and elevating shareholder power. Paradoxically, however, the fracturing of the corporate elite has not led to a widespread retreat of managerialism. Corporate managers have replaced their collective structural resources, embedded in their board interlock network, with organizational structural resources located within their firms. By adopting lone-insider board structures where the CEO is the only employee on the board of directors, CEOs establish brokerage positions within their focal firms, allowing them to preserve their autonomy even as the broader network withers. Firms nested in cohesive communities were the first to adopt lone-insider boards, supplementing and eventually replacing closure with brokerage as a structural resource. These alternative structural resources operated to preserve managerialism during different times. Network closure traditionally helped to preserve managerialism against shareholder pressure, but this effect disappeared as the network fragmented in the mid-2000s. In its absence, managers increasingly relied on organizational brokerage positions to maintain their autonomy. Consequently, managerialism remains surprisingly robust in the era of a fractured corporate board interlock network because top managers have become more focused on establishing positions of power within their own firms.

The central hypothesis of the managerial power approach (MPA) states that power is the main driver of executive compensation. The positive impact of power on compensation is allegedly demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies. We argue that the hypothesis of a positive impact of power on pay is not falsifiable empirically. The MPA is thus not testable. Empirical studies in this vein can only be interpreted as validation procedures for the empirical power measures employed. We suggest a new theoretical framework for research on the power-compensation relationship. This framework can be used to identify valid power measures empirically. The arguments presented in our paper allow for a reassessment of the role of power in the corporate governance debate. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Following a stakeholder corporate governance perspective, we examine whether the characteristics of boards of directors (board size, separation of Chairman and CEO roles, independent directors and board ownership) have an impact on the value-added distribution to stakeholders, who are differentiated as shareholders and other primary stakeholders (workers, creditors and government), and if these characteristics could contribute to a more equitable distribution of the value added. Considering that the main concern of the primary stakeholders is the distribution of wealth, we focus our approaches on the value-added distribution as a proxy for the primary stakeholders interests. We conduct a panel data analysis of 438 observations of Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2012 and test various models that offer new insights into stakeholder perspectives. The results show that within the context of ownership concentration and with a unitary board system of corporate governance, the incorporation of independent directors on the Board and the separation of power (between Chairman and CEO) are important corporate control mechanisms with which to defend the interests of other primary stakeholders (workers, creditors and government). In addition, the results highlight that regulators and shareholders should be wary of excessive board ownership and oversized boards, as these may contribute to exacerbating the conflict of interests between shareholders and other primary stakeholders. These results contribute to the debate concerning the dichotomized approach of corporate governance (shareholders/stakeholders corporate governance).

The emerging markets undergo constant transformations and changes, and thus, a change of strategy can be critical for companies. However, the impact of R&D investment on firm performance and the role of the board of directors that makes decisions about a company's innovative activities remain inconclusive. This paper investigates the relationship between a board of directors' composition and structure in innovative companies and firm performance. Using the panel data of innovative Russian public companies that made R&D investments in 2011-2013, we found a positive relationship between the boards' independence and ROA as an indicator of firm performance. Moreover, it was shown that innovative companies that establish a strategy committee will on average have a higher ROA ratio than innovative companies without such a committee. Innovative firms in emerging markets might consider creating strategic committees and increasing board independence to enhance their performance and increase the number of successful R&D investments.

The paper illustrates the models of corporate governance in the aspects of its definition, nature of management and objectives along with its roles, regulation and power of various stakeholders in ensuring the accountability and the protection of the rights of various stakeholders from conventional and Islamic perspectives. These models are different in their characteristics, nature, culture, costume, epistemology, and country?s rules and regulation. However, the conventional models highlight the roles of shareholders, stakeholders, depositors, institutions, investors, and communities from the perspective of the nation?s demand and cultures. In contrast, the Islamic model of corporate governance consists of some roles and responsibilities such as the responsibilities to suppliers, customers, investment account holders, shareholders, management, the board of directors, competitors, Shariah supervisory boards, societies, and the employees from its spiritual and social commitments. Through the critical analysis of these models of corporate governance is deemed to help the empirical research on corporate governance model and develop a certain model of Islamic corporate governance. However, the paper may help to give a simple understanding of the corporate governance models in both the conventional and Islamic perspectives of financial institutions. (c) 2019 Conscientia Beam.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

Sukuk yields mimic those of conventional bonds due to having similar features. Sukuk are shariah-compliant securities that offer different structures to those of conventional bonds. Therefore, it is believed that the spreading of yields should also be different. The presence of key institutional investors/owners and certain Board of Directors (BOD) characteristics as highlighted by the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may influence the yield to maturity (YTM) of conventional bonds and sukuk. Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these two yield spreads instruments with corporate governance mechanisms. The data is obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, the Bondinfo Hub of the Malaysian Central Bank, the Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM), the Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014 for 256 and 405 tranches of long-term and medium-term issuances of conventional bonds and sukuk respectively. The most significant findings show that the presence of top-six and other institutional ownerships as corporate governance mechanism proxy insignificantly and significantly reduce yield spreads within the firm revealed by Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and random effects models in long-term and medium-term issuances.

This study aims to identify theieffectiofiboard size, ownership concentration, and dividend on the performance of manufacturing firmsi in thei ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)-5 countries during the period 2012-2016. Board size measured by the number of members on the board of directors. Ownership concentration is measured by a blockholder variable, which is defined as the percentage of shareholding by 5% or more. Dividend is measured by dividend per share. Firm performance is measured by return on equity (ROE). The study uses the panel data analysis method. The results show that board size positively affects firm performance; ownership concentration negatively affects firm performance; and dividend per share negatively affects firm performance.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

This paper investigates whether firms with strong corporate governance perceive non-audit services (NAS) as a threat to auditor independence or as a mechanism to improve audit quality. The sample consisted of 706 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia in 2014 and employed six proxies for corporate governance. The findings show that firms with a bigger audit committee and a higher proportion of independent members in the audit committee are linked with higher NAS, consistent with the resource-based view. The study also found that audit firms in the Big 4 were paid a higher amount of NAS compared to non-Big 4 firms., in line with the general view that the Big 4 auditors supply higher quality services than the non-Big 4. However, it was also found that a more independent board of directors is associated with a low NAS. This suggests that although the board of directors might perceive NAS a threat to auditor independence, a strong audit committee subscribes to the argument that the benefits outweigh the costs. This study contributes to the present literature on the determinants of NAS in an emerging market and would be informative to regulators worldwide when considering new policies related to NAS.

Putting together the puzzles from all the previous chapters, this chapter starts to explore and explain how the discourses of legitimacy and paradigm, as discussed in Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6, are manifested in the specific governance structure in Chinese banks. Reflecting on the production of the board of director in generic corporations then banking organizations, the chapter studies specifically the organization and behavior of the board of directors in Chinese banks, which embraces the orientation of the bank board, its composition, the board size and its independence. Illustrating the hybrid nature of the paradigm discourses of the enhanced shareholder primacy and diversified stakeholder theory and relevant legitimacy discourses, the board of directors in Chinese banks are observed to be heavily guided toward sustainable profitability to the shareholders, active support for economic development, and balance of interests of various stakeholders. Similar representation of discourses of legitimacy and paradigm is demonstrated in the board composition, the board size, and the board independence in Chinese banking industry.

Corporate governance remains a privileged field for researchers in management sciences. The interest in looking at the governance bodies is that they are supposed to play a very important role in driving the business towards the goals set efficiency and effectiveness. Determining the composition and the ideal functioning of these governance bodies is an ultimate goal for researchers and practitioners, but the road is still long because the conclusions of the studies made up to this day on the subject do not unanimously. One of the topics (and little discussed) about the effect of gender diversity on the effectiveness of the board of directors.The purpose of this article is to present a contribution in the analysis of the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors on the financial performance of Moroccan banks. After a presentation of the mission of the board of directors and its objectives, we presented the main theories, which evoked our problematic, then to present a synthesis of the works, which studied the impact of the presence of the women on the performance of the banks and finally an empirical analysis of this relationship. This analysis is made from the data of six Moroccan banks over a period of 10 years. The results showed that there is only one positive and significant relationship between the presence of women and the financial performance expressed by ROE and ROA.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of corporate board and audit committee characteristics and ownership structures on market-based financial performance of listed firms in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: It applies system GMM (generalized method of moments) as the baseline estimator approach, and ordinary least squares and fixed effects for robustness checks on a sample of 452 firms listed on the Thai Stock Exchange for the period 2000-2016. Findings: Relying mainly on the system GMM estimator, the empirical results indicate some emerging trends in the Thai economy. Contrary to expectations for an emerging market and prior research findings, ownership structures, particularly ownership concentration and family ownership, appear to have no significant influence on market-based firm performance, while managerial ownership exerts a positive effect on performance. Moreover, as expected, board structure variables such as board independence; size; meeting and dual role; and audit committee meeting show significant explanatory power on market-based firm performance in Thai firms. Practical implications: These findings are important for policymakers in constructing an appropriate set of governance mechanisms in an emerging market context, and for corporate entities and investors in shaping their understanding of corporate governance in the Thai institutional context. Originality/value: Unlike previous literature on the Thai market, this study is the first to use the more advanced econometric method known as system GMM estimator for addressing causality/endogeneity issues in governance-performance relationships. The findings indicate new trends in the explanatory power of ownership structure variables on market-based firm performance in Thai-listed firms. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the mediating role of board effectiveness (understood as the capacity to efficiently manage and control all functions to guarantee the company's prosperity) in the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use partial least squares methodology to test the direct and indirect relationships between gender diversity in boards of directors and business performance. Findings: Although the relationship between the presence of women on the board and the board's effectiveness is statistically significant, this relationship is negative. However, board effectiveness (measured by the three constructs: strategic control, organizational innovation and decision-making) has a positive and statistically significant effect on business performance. Finally, there is a positive, but not statistically significant, relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has a small sample size, and most of the boards of directors analyzed are unequal with only a few companies achieving gender parity. Social implications: Public institutions must promote actions to achieve a critical mass of women directors and managers, so that women transcend a merely "symbolic" role on a board and are able to develop their skills and characteristics, thereby improving a board's effectiveness and business performance. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the diversity and governance literature by providing a better understanding of the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. It considers the influence of women on the board through a holistic framework, analyzing the mediating role of the board's effectiveness. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study builds on implementation intention theory to indicate that both business and family governance practices influence the succession planning process in family firms. In addition, this study draws on goal adjustment theory to explore whether the family CEO's emotions, being his or her inability to let go of the family firm, hamper the governance decisions of the board of directors concerning that succession planning process. Applying a moderated mediation analysis on a sample of 225 family firms, results show that board involvement in the succession process mediates the positive relationship between the use of family governance practices and the level of succession planning. In addition, the family CEO's inability to let go negatively moderates this mediating relationship which signifies that emotions influence governance outcomes in family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: The role of the board chair has become increasingly complex in recent decades. Research on corporate governance has called for and has initiated the pursuit of more research for the purpose of creating a better understanding of the role of board chairs. We reviewed 234 academic articles published in 66 journals, structured the existing research according to an Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework, and provided a future research agenda for studies on the role of the board chair. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals that the number of published studies on the position of the board chair has grown over the last two decades. Although extant research is dominated by quantitative studies exploring the impact of the board chair position on financial performance, frequently drawing on agency and stewardship theory, recent work has moved beyond this focus and has added valuable insights. The Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework used to structure the extant research reveals that future research should pursue topics related to all components of the framework and that opportunities exist to draw from a broader set of theories. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the framework, we formulate seven specific research topics that can add valuable insights into the role of the board chair and suggest theories that can help inform research pursuing these topics. Taken together, these topics have the potential to create valuable insights into how board chairs are appointed, develop competencies, and interact and work with the CEO, the top management team, the board, and other stakeholders while acknowledging the influence of contextual factors, such as ownership, diversity, the firm's development stage, and external events and trends. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review shows a growing global movement toward prescribing more corporate governance regulations and separating the positions of the board chair and the CEO. We show that many aspects need to be considered when choosing a governance configuration and when appointing a board chair because this role is becoming increasingly demanding.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether female directors have an effect on company financial performance in a patriarchal emerging country that has a collectivistic culture with a substantial gender equality gap and is characterized with a paternalistic management culture. In addition, it aims to investigate whether the affiliations of female directors matter performance-wise in a setting where the majority of the companies are ultimately controlled by large business groups including families. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a unique hand-collected data set that covers all non-financial public companies quoted at the Borsa Istanbul between the years 2009 and 2017. To investigate the relationships between the presence and ratio of female directors and company financial performance, the current study uses the pooled ordinary least squares method, as well as the firm-fixed effects method to overcome potential omitted variables problems and various generalized method of moments methods to overcome potential reverse causality problems. Findings: The findings of the current study demonstrate that the presence and percentage of female directors both have a positive effect on company financial performance in a cultural setting where the opposite might be expected. They also present evidence suggesting that the effect becomes larger as the level of the independence of female directors becomes greater. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates that the presence of female directors on boards has a positive effect on company financial performance, even in a cultural setting that is very different from those of countries where the majority of previous studies on female directors are conducted on. In addition, it demonstrates how company financial performance varies with the level of the affiliation of female directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to reexamine the link between board racial diversity and firm performance. It focuses on the mechanism through which board racial diversity could affect performance. The paper proposes and empirically tests the role of employee productivity and R&D productivity in the relationship between board racial diversity and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a mediation analysis framework with the bootstrapping method to test both the direct and indirect effect of board diversity on firm performance. The data used in the study come from S&P 1500 with variables composed from COMPUSTAT, Institutional Shareholder Services and Wharton Research Data Services. Findings: Contrary to prior findings, the results indicate that there is neither direct effect of board racial diversity on firm performance nor is there an indirect effect through either employee productivity or R&D productivity. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used in the paper are based on large public firms, the results may not generalize to small or private firms. Practical implications: The findings of the paper suggest that not all diversity measures matter in the same way and firms should carefully make board appointments to reduce the perception that they select directors for any reason other than qualifications. Originality/value: The paper advances the literature on board diversity by examining two previously unexplored mediating variables of employee productivity and R&D productivity. It also uses more rigorous mediation analysis with bootstrapping method and a validation sample to improve robustness of the results. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims at examining the level of risk of disclosure practices and the effect of four board of directors' characteristics (board size, board meetings, CEO duality and board expertise) on these practices in the Jordanian context. This study also adds to the body of literature by examining the moderating effect of family ownership on the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study contains the non-financial Jordanian firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). 376 annual reports of the sampled firms over four years from 2014 to 2017 were used. The content analysis approach was used to collect data and to determine the level of risk disclosure by computing the number of risk-related sentences in the annual reporting. To test the study's hypothesis, the random effect model was employed. Findings: The empirical results show that the total of the risk disclosure sentences for each firm ranges from a minimum value of 2 sentences to a maximum value of 61 sentences, and the mean of CRD is 28 sentences. The results also indicate that the board expertise is positively related with the level of risk disclosure. Conversely, CEO duality has a negative impact on the risk disclosure practices. However, the results failed to support that the board size and the board meetings have a significant effect on the level of risk disclosure. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the family ownership moderates the relationship between the board of directors and the corporate risk disclosure. Practical implications: The finding of this study is more likely be useful for many concerned parties, researchers, authorities, investors and financial analysts alike in understanding the current practices of the risk disclosure in Jordan, thus helping them in reconsidering and reviewing the accounting standards and improving the credibility and transparency of the financial reports in the Jordanian capital market. Originality/value: The current study contributes to the literature of risk disclosure because the previous research has paid little attention to this topic in Jordan. To the best knowledge of the researcher, this study is the first Jordanian study that focuses on examining the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure in the non-financial sector. Furthermore, it is the first study that examines the moderating role of family ownership on such relationships. Consequently, the results of the current study draw attention to the CRD practices and the monitoring role of board of directors in Jordan. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This work seeks to contribute to the debate about whether or not family businesses are more innovative than other kind of companies, and explore the specific effects women on boards have on innovation, comparing family and non-family businesses. Data collected from Spanish listed companies belonging to innovative sectors between 2003 and 2017 confirm that being a family business impacts positively on the number of registered patents and the proportion of women on boards exert a positive influence on R&D and patents. Moreover, the proportion of women on boards influences innovation in a different way when family and non-family businesses are compared, and depending on whether female directors belong or not to the family of control. Therefore, the results obtained suggest some relevant recommendations for research and practitioners, providing new insights into the debate on the benefits of family companies for innovation and of gender diversity of their boards.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of gender diversity among the board of directors (BOD) and Shariah supervisory board (SSB) members on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for a sample of 19 Islamic banks for the period 2010-2018 were collected to test the research hypotheses using pooled ordinary least squares estimation method. Generalized least squares estimation method was used to confirm that the results are robust. This study lagged the explanatory variables by one period to control for potential endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that Islamic banks with more gender-diverse BOD and SSB are expected to have better financial performance. In addition, this paper finds that an increase in Islamic banks' size may undermine the positive impact of gender diversity among SSB members on Islamic banks' financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only on Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to data constraints; thus, the results may not be generalizable to Islamic banks in other countries. Practical implications: Improving financial performance is crucial for banks, especially for Islamic banks, to sustain their fast-growing share globally. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to provide insight and understanding in the selection and appointment of BOD and SSB members at Islamic banks. Social implications: By having women represented in the BOD and SSB, Islamic banks will benefit equally from valuable abilities across demographic groups in the society. Furthermore, if the members of the BOD and SSB are properly selected, Islamic banks with more gender-diverse boards can effectively contribute to enhancing social welfare of various segments in the society. Originality/value: This is the first study, as far as is known to the authors, that provides empirical evidence on the influence of gender diversity among BOD and SSB members on the financial performance of Islamic banks. This paper is expected to be used as a reference by the shareholders and customers of Islamic banks in ensuring that the BOD and SSB have the best optimal composition that maximizes their profits.

In spite of the high failure rates of later-generation family companies, the research on family firm strategic renewals has been limited. The role of the owners in these situations, in particular, remains underexplored. We address this research gap and suggest that the owners of a family firm can take an active resource role in triggering and supporting change, and by balancing the disruption through bridging the firm's new direction with the past. We propose a framework that illustrates the relationships between the conditions for renewal, strategies for renewal and the owners' behaviour. In addition, we theorise that the owners' influence is not only carried out via active board membership, but also indirectly via the owners' discussions with the TMT and between family members.

Drawing on resource dependence theory and group diversity research, this paper examines how board gender and racial diversity impact corporate divestitures. We argue that due to the diverse experiences, knowledge, and perspectives that female and racial minority directors bring to the boardroom, it is more difficult and time-consuming for the board to reach a consensus and pursue a common course of action. Consistent with this argument, our results indicate that board gender and racial diversity lead to longer divestiture completion times and a lower divestiture rate. Additionally, we argue that due to their cognitive heterogeneity, diverse boards likely exchange a greater variety of information, engage in more thorough discussions, and implement greater oversight of divestitures, leading to more positive divestitures returns. Offering mixed support for this argument, we found that while gender diversity increased divestiture returns, racial diversity was associated with lower divestiture returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Purpose: Despite agreement on the importance of adopting governance structures for developing competitive advantage, we still know little about why or how governance mechanisms are adopted in the first place. We also acknowledge that family businesses with formal governance mechanisms in place still resort to informal means to make decisions, and we lack knowledge about why certain governance mechanisms are sometimes, but not always, effective and functional. Given these research gaps, and drawing on institutional theory, we aim to explore: How are governance structures adopted and developed in family firms? Once adopted, how do family businesses perceive these governance structures? Design/methodology/approach: Using Mokken Scale Analysis, a method suitable to uncover patterns/sequences of adoption/acquisition over time, we analyze a dataset of 1,488 Spanish family firms to explore if there is a specific pattern in the implementation of governance structures. We complement the analysis with descriptive data about perceived usefulness of such structures. Findings: Our findings highlight two important issues. Family businesses follow a specific process implementing first business governance (board of directors, then executive committee), followed by family governance (family council then family constitution). We suggest they do so in response to institutional pressures, given the exposure they have to business practices, and their need to appear legitimate. Despite formal adoption of governance structures, family businesses do not necessarily consider them useful. We suggest that their perception about the usefulness of the implemented governance structures may lead to their ceremonial adoption, resulting in a gap between the implementation and functionality of such structures. Research limitations/implications: Our article contributes to the family business literature by bringing novel insights about implementation of governance structures. We take a step back to explain why these governance mechanisms were adopted in the first place. Using institutional theory we enrich governance and family business literatures, by offering a lens that explains why family businesses follow a specific process in adopting governance structures. We also offer a plausible explanation as to why governance structures are ineffective in achieving their theorized role in the context of family businesses, based on the family's perception of the unusefulness of such structures, and the concept of ceremonial adoption. Practical implications: There is no single recipe that can serve the multiple needs of different family businesses. This indicates that family businesses may need diverse levels of development and order when setting up their governance structures. Accordingly, this study constitutes an important point of demarcation for practitioners interested in examining the effectiveness of governance structures in family firms. We show that an important pre-requisite for examining the effectiveness of governance structures is to start by investigating whether these structures are actually being used or are only adopted ceremonially. Originality/value: Our paper expands current knowledge on governance in family firms by taking a step back hinting at why are governance structures adopted in the first place. Focusing on how governance is implemented in terms of sequence is novel and relevant for researcher and practitioners to understand how this process unfolds. Our study uses institutional theory, which is a strong theory to support the results. Our paper also uses a novel method to study governance structures in family firms.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims at discovering the association between earnings management (EM) and gender diversity in boards of directors as a predictor of the corporate social performance (CSP) of non-smallmedium-sized enterprises in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The existence of a broad literature on the topic allows us to assess EM and its relations with CSR. We used an OLS regression analysis and the accrual quality measure as an EM proxy to investigate our sample of 697 Italian non-small and medium-sized enterprises. Our main results reveal that the presence of women on boards of directors results in the adoption of fewer EM practices. Therefore, our empirical findings support the notion that boardroom gender diversity as an instrument of CSP reduces the use of EM practices. The results of this paper are of most relevance to policymakers and academic communities focused on promoting CSP and CSR. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

This study explores contextual and organisational factors that influence the likelihood of adopting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-friendly practices. Drawing on institutional theory, we hypothesise that state laws, state conservativism, and localised LGBT-friendliness density will have a direct effect on the adoption of LGBT-friendly practices. Given the observed variation in the adoption of these practices, we also draw on strategic choice and the upper echelons perspective and hypothesise that the effect of institutional mechanisms is moderated by the beliefs and values of powerful organisational agents (chief executive officers and boards of directors). Our sample consists of 201 U.S.-based Fortune 1000 companies over a period of seven years, and we test our hypotheses using a Cox proportional hazards survival analysis. Our results offer support for the role of state conservativism and localised LGBT-friendliness density in the likelihood of LGBT-friendly practices adoption, as well as for the moderating role of chief executive officer and board of directors' political orientation.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the differential impact on the stock market of statements made by and information about directors and companies who are politically connected, compared to directors and companies with no political connections. The authors also analyze the role played by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which the authors have identified as politically connected companies because most board members are appointed by political authorities. Furthermore, the boundaries and institutional environment within which SOEs operate are likely to be different from private companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is composed of over 60,000 news articles on the boards of directors (both with political roles and without political roles) of listed Italian companies in the period 1998-2013. On that sample the authors run a regression analysis under the signaling theory approach. Findings: Results suggest a positive effect on market capitalization associated with individual political connections. This effect decreases when the political connection extends to the whole enterprise although it still remains, while a negative effect is associated with state-controlled enterprises. The impact of negative news content does not change depending on whether a board member has a political role or not. Originality/value: Previous research has demonstrated a causal link between stock prices and their reaction to corporate news (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011; Peress, 2014), but no studies have quantified the different reactions that occur when the news mentions politically connected companies and individuals who hold a political role.

Gender diversity in boards of directors has the potential to add value to the organizations that promote it. Under the premise of theories such as: agency, resource dependence or stakeholders, there have been several studies that have analysed the relationship between the number of women in the boards and the economic and financial results of the companies. However, the review of these papers allows us to obtain two clear conclusions. First, that the results are not conclusive, since positive, negative and non-significant relationships have been found between both variables. And the second, that most of these studies have been carried out on large companies listed on the Stock Exchange Market, mainly Public Limited Companies and Limited Liability Companies. In this way, this paper tries to contribute to the literature on this topic, analysing the gender diversity in the board of the Spanish agri-food cooperative societies and their influence on the profitability of the company. Specifically, 1171 cooperatives of the agri-food sector in Spain have been analysed, using statistical regression techniques. The results show that there are significant differences depending on the type of board, classifying them according to the degree of parity of each one, and the ROE and ROA profitability measures. In addition, in the case of the ROA, a positive and significant relationship is also observed between the percentage of women on the board and this variable of profitability.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

High-growth firm is the research object of economic and business studies, because of its important influence on job creation, innovation, and tax revenues increase for the nation. This paper is designed to find some empirical evidence on the role of corporate governance on the firm's growth, thereby providing some policy implications for improving corporate governance activities in practice. Using a sample of 241 listed companies on Vietnam's stock market in the period 2008-2017, divided into 2 groups: high-growth firms and non-high-growth firms and applying a GMM regression with the dependent variable as 3-year compound growth rate, the study finds evidence of factors affecting the growing ability of corporate governance, namely: the ownership structure, the characteristics of the Board of Directors (size, independence, gender, non-executive member, experience), and the characteristics of the CEO (age, educational level, ownership, duality).

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and other questionable business incidents that appear to harm stakeholders frequently afflict firms yet draw disparate investor reactions. We address this disparity by investigating the association between firm legal orientation and investor reactions to CSI. We hypothesize the proportion of board members and top management team (TMT) executives with law degrees affects investor perceptions of firm foresight, and in turn, their judgment of blame and consequent punishment. Based on abnormal returns to 629 announcements of CSI and 308 publicly traded S&P 500 firms, we find that both too small and too large a proportion of board of directors and TMT members with law degrees lead investors to mete out harsher punishment. This inverted u-shaped link is further affected by firm size, firm risk, and industry competition. Our investigation sheds light on the link between executive education and financial performance in the context of CSI and investor perceptions of foresight. (c) 2020 W.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates the impact of women directors on financial outcomes--return and risk of Indian companies. It applies fixed and random effects Tobit regressions to examine the effect of female directors on financial outcomes (returns and risk) of the firm, controlling promoters' shareholding, leverage, firm growth and age, board size and board meetings. The study does not find any support to agency and resource dependence theories because the proportion of women directors in most Indian boards is too small to make much impact. However, it has a moderating influence to reduce variations in accounting profits and stock returns. The investors reward also meeting the regulatory quota of woman member on the boards by higher market returns indicating a signalling effect. The study adds an understanding of quota induced women directors' influence on the firm's financial outcomes. However, the regulators should be cautious in mandating induction of women members on the boards as they might be inexperienced or lack the needed grounding to effectively influence board processes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

The paper examines the impact of corporate governance (CG) on firm value (FV) of enterprises in Vietnam. We consider the GC issue from the individual aspects of each member of the Board of Directors (BOD). The research uses GLS regression model, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam during the period 2008-2018, with 2937 observations. The research results have found that the size of the BOD has a direct impact on FV, while it is interesting that the Board of Directors' independence has a direct impact on FV when measured by market value, but is in an inverse relation with FV if measured at book value. In addition, BOD chairperson cum CEO has an inverse impact on FV and female BOD members do not have an impact on FV. Further, the research results also prove that an enterprise's size is directly related with its value, whereas financial leverage is inversely related with the enterprise's value. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to increase their value, thus enabling the consideration of factors of the board of director at each enterprise.

This paper examines the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on intellectual capital disclosure. Using data of 27 non-financial listed Tunisian firms, the current study provides evidence in support of the nonlinear relationship between corporate governance and Intellectual capital disclosure. The empirical results show that the structure and the way the board of directors' functions are systematically significant factors determining intangible capital disclosure. The empirical tests indicate that managers, majority shareholders as well as institutional shareholders have a significant effect on the informative transparency of intangible capital. These results seem to corroborate the view that an increase in corporate governance mechanisms has a positive effect on voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, tests of the nonlinear hypothesis show that an increase in the number of board members up to nine, and an increase in the number of majority shareholders up to 67% have a beneficial effect on intangible disclosure. However, as these variables increase beyond a turning point, the effect inverts and cuts off the improvement of voluntary disclosure of intangibles. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: To date, there has been little research about the degree of correspondence between partner equity ownership and partner representation on boards of joint ventures (JVs). It is generally assumed that partners' share equals board representation in percentage. This paper aims to explore various instances of deviation from the above norm. Design/methodology/approach: Using a unique database of 259 JV contracts extracted from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and by drawing from resource dependency and transaction cost theories, this manuscript explores the factors that increase or decrease the deviation between equity share and board representation. Findings: The results show that international JVs (IJVs) tend to deviate more, while JVs with a deadlock clause, a large board and based in a stable country deviate less from the degree of correspondence between equity share and board representation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the alliance and governance literatures by identifying factors that influence the degree of correspondence between partner investment (equity share) and control through board of director representation.

By analyzing the literature regarding the peculiarities of the Corporate Governance (CG) structure and their impact on the companies' performance, it is possible to understand that the characteristics of the CG, especially of the Board of Directors (BoDs), strongly affect companies. Particularly, it is renowned that the diversity of members, as well as their identity, can influence the obtainable results. Among all different kinds of diversity, the gender element was chosen in the present work, because although it has been studied by several scholars, its relationship with the companies' performance still remains partially unexplored. Furthermore, other important personal characteristics of members of BoD are considered in the present study, in line with how it is represented in both organizational and professional identity theories. Starting from another work done by the authors (Tutino et al., Corporate governance, CSR and financial performances: what types of relationships exist between these dimensions? In: Corporate governance: search for the advanced practices, pp 231-240. https://doi.org/10.22495/cpr19p12, 2019), where was studied what characteristics of BoD could influence the performance, the aim of this paper is to analyze the diversity of the BoD' members, with the focus on gender, as well as to verify if in the world of "women in business," some characteristics (as knowledge, skills, personal characteristics, level of education) are determinant and influence the thought process of directors and how they make decisions, which can impact strategy formulation, therefore the performance of companies. To understand how the personal features of the members of BoD could be more perceivable regarding both the financial and CSR policies, the work is carried out using quantitative analysis on the data of the most capitalized Italian listed companies on December 28, 2018. The findings demonstrated that the ones who are more interested on the topic of sustainability inside the Board are women that have recently joined the board, whose education is in the area of engineering. On the other hand, the members that give more attention to financial performance are men that have been on the board for a long period, despite their age, who belong to the audit associate profession. The value of the present work is represented by the possibility of bridging the gap highlighted above, with reference to the relationship between the corporate governance structure and company performance. Another important aspect brought to light by this study concerns the specific characteristics of the board members that most influence strategic decisions and therefore performances.

The number of women in the boards of directors has increased in a lot of international firms, in recent years, with the help of the gender quotas, but we do not know whether this fact leads to an increase in gender equality. Based on a literature review about gender diversity, business performance, and perceived gender equality, the present research investigates if perceived gender equality is present in the Italian listed companies, which are subjected to mandatory gender quotas, analyzing if differences between men and women exist. Given the fact that almost all Italian listed companies have reached the minimum threshold imposed by the law (20%), we analyze whether and which differences exist in perceived gender equality, between men and women, using a questionnaire based on previous studies in literature review. This paper contributes to expand the empirical studies and literature review emphasizing the relevance of identifying the presence of gender equality in the Italian listed companies to a better understanding of the perceptions within the boards of directors and to the differences between the two genders.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This chapter aims to set the ground, providing a brief definition of the corporate governance according to worldwide practices and focusing on the role and the functions of the board of directors. To reach this goal, a punctual review of the different theoretical frameworks coping with this topic is provided, putting in evidence the main differences as well as the principal points in common. Specifically, the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, the stewardship theory, the resource dependence theory, and the institutional theory are analysed. Moreover, the role of BoDs is analysed together with the features and the overview of "good" corporate governance practices according to existing literature and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

In the management of agency problems, the board of directors is an essential tool for monitoring the activities of the managers. The board of directors has specific characteristics associated with its effectiveness and efficiency, which can be transformed into the general performance of the company. This study aimed at providing evidence regarding the characteristics possessed by the East Africa community companies' board of directors and their influence on the companies performance. Simultaneous system of equations and annual data from 16 companies for a period between 2003 and 2017 was used in the study. The study observed that the market performance measures to be highly influenced by the changes in the characteristics of the board such as board size, the proportion of women, proportion of independent directors and proportion of foreign directors. On the other hand, the account performance measures were less influenced by the board characteristics, and only ROE was more associated with the changes on board characteristics. During this period, the market was more overwhelmed by new information regarding the board characteristics as compared to the performance of the account measures.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

Corporate governance has long been the subject of interest for researchers in business administration. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices decided by boards of directors are now a key issue in the decision-making process of companies. The relationship between the governance structure and CSR policies is crucial to defining the companies' strategic view. In this paper, we identify how the characteristics of corporate governance impact CSR disclosure. Our findings show that a large board of directors reduces the probability of adhering to practices that involve stakeholders more closely in company activity, while companies with more independent directors have a higher level of stakeholder protection almost by definition. Thus, there is a need for additional ways of involving stakeholders in company activity. Our results also reveal that an overlap between the roles of the CEO and the board chairman is an undesirable influence on a CSR report. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The Covid-19 pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to advance research on how various corporate governance mechanisms shape firms' decision-making, survival and success. In the short term, corporate governance research could pinpoint which mechanisms in place before the pandemic (e.g., ownership structure, board attributes, executive compensation) will shape corporate responses, thus affecting firms' survival in the post-pandemic period. In the long term, the crisis will trigger structural changes in governance mechanisms to enable firms to either prevent or respond to the occurrences of potentially similar events. In the reminder of this essay, we will first discuss the peculiar nature of the recent crisis in relation to other recent crises. Then, we will analyse the impact of Covid-19 on five key areas in the field of corporate governance (i.e., corporate purpose, ownership structure, board of directors, executive compensation and accountability) and, for each of them, we will suggest a series of research questions that contribute to redirecting and advancing the domain.

We draw on the agency and stewardship perspectives to determine whether and how the effect of family leadership on the entrepreneurial orientation-performance relationship in small and medium (SME) family firms is contingent on the main life cycle dimensions: firm size, generational stage, and board of directors' engagement. The analyses of 284 Belgian family SMEs reveal that nonfamily leaders outperform family leaders in transforming entrepreneurial orientation into performance in larger firms, whereas family leaders outpace nonfamily leaders when the board has a strong engagement in serving the CEO.

The literature on gender diversity in boards of directors has expanded significantly in recent years, due to the fact that women are increasingly holding higher management positions within the company hierarchy, clearly demonstrating that certain characteristics of women have a positive impact on different areas within the company. The objective of this paper is to analyze scientific articles on the presence of women in boards of directors, based on a literature review, in order to learn about the evolution of this concept over time. The search conducted for this paper produced 300 documents from the Web of Science, with a final total result of 168 documents after passing the initial results through various filters. VOSviewer software was used to analyze the information, which enabled the creation of bibliometric citation, co-citation and co-word maps. The results reveal the most relevant authors and studies on this subject and identify the most current studies, the main topic of which deals with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in addition to highlighting the characteristics of women that are of vital importance to boards of directors within the current context: empathy, open innovation, concern for the needs of interest groups and a heightened perception of risks.

We theorize that female candidates considering CEO roles will perceive greater termination vulnerability in such roles than their male counterparts. We further theorize that indicators of recent organizational distress will exacerbate female CEO candidates' perceptions of termination vulnerability, while the presence of female leaders will mitigate these concerns. To test our arguments, we examine the initial values of newly appointed female and male CEOs' severance agreements from 2007 to 2014. Results support our arguments and begin to shed light on the factors that influence female executives' concerns about CEO roles and ultimately firms' ability to appoint female CEOs.

The present work aimed to empirically examine the association between corporate governance mechanisms and the extent of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in European financial institutions. The corporate governance variables, particularly board size, board independence, the proportion of female directors, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, ownership concentration and CEO ownership, were used. The sample of this empirical research consisted of 115 financial institutions belonging to 12 European countries from 2007 to 2017, and panel data regression was used for analysis. The results indicate that board size, board independence, the proportion of female directors and the CEO ownership have positive associations with the extent of CSR disclosure, while CEO duality and ownership concentration have no significant associations with the extent of CSR disclosure. This study is important due to following reasons: First, it focused on the financial sector which is often excluded from CSR studies due to its specific legal regulations and its little environmental impact. Second, this study provides empirical evidence that some governance mechanisms are important determinants of CSR disclosure in the financial sector. Third, it uses the environmental, social and governance score, which has not been widely used in CSR studies, especially in financial institutions. Finally, the research states the crucial implications for the financial sector and regulatory bodies.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency.

Using resource dependence theory, we analyze board interlocks, their industry origin, and their relationship to firms' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Interlocks create connections by having board members from one firm sit on other firms' boards, providing an avenue for sharing information and resources to aid in knowledge transfer and capability development. As firms face challenges for improved GHG emissions performance, they may look to their board members' connections to other firms to acquire needed resources. Using a sample of US Standard & Poor's (S&P) 1500 firms for years 2009 to 2018, we find that firms with a greater number of board interlocks achieve lower GHG emissions intensity. We also find that boards for the best performing companies have interlocks in the same industry, in other industries, and with firms leading in GHG emissions intensity, especially for firms in higher environmentally impacting industries, as they face greater emissions challenges.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

The literature investigating corporate governance (CG) disclosure has predominantly stressed the monitoring role of the board of directors, analysing the association between information about the board's independence and firm market performance. Drawing from managerial studies, the governance literature has recently recognized corporate performance is affected by a wider set of directors' personal traits. However, CG reporting does not currently require disclosure of most of these characteristics. We believe knowledge of directors' personal traits is valuable for investors if these characteristics are indicators of company performance. Drawing on a sample of listed Italian family firms, we embrace a wide set of hand-collected information that captures directors' profiles to verify their association with Tobin's Q. Even if such associations are casual, we infer that information about board members' profiles beyond CG report disclosures is useful for market participants. The results from the regression analyses show that information about directors' personal details, educational backgrounds, and work experience in specific professional areas is predictive of market performance, and that the market evaluates board members' personal information that is currently ignored in CG reports. The study offers practical contributions to standard setters, highlighting the need to extend CG reporting requirements for directors' personal profiles. Further, the evidence contributes to drawing the attention of preparers and users to board of directors' profile information that is currently not disclosed in CG reporting.

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

This study empirically investigates the role of political connections in corporate environmental spending. It employs a sample of listed Chinese firms from polluting industries within the 2010-2013 period. Our empirical results show that having politicians as directors reduces the magnitude of discharge fees. We also find that such reductions are more pronounced in firms with a higher ratio of politically connected directors (i.e., listed Chinese polluting firms that are privately controlled). This negative relationship is robust to various model specifications (e.g., a sample of polluting firms after addressing the sample selection bias and reverse causality without an increase in new investment). Moreover, we observe that the negative relationship between political connections and discharge fees is stronger in listed Chinese polluting firms located in more polluted regions. Meanwhile, a polluting firm's incentive to engage in environmental protection, measured by firm-level environmental awards (incidents), alleviates (exacerbates) the negative relationship. Finally, the impact of politically connected directors on discharge levies is explicitly driven by having local officials and officials from the home province as directors.

This study examines the effect of board of directors' expertise and tax avoidance on corporate debt. We find that there is no association between financially expert outside directors on the board and corporate debt, which is contrary to some prior research findings. However, we do find a positive association between the proportion of financially expert inside directors on the board and debt. We also find that the debt substitution effect is significantly intensified by the presence of outside directors on the board with financial expertise, which suggests that the advice offered by these directors better informs managers to make decisions about the trade-off between the benefits and costs of debt and non-debt tax shields. We find no such effect for inside directors. Overall, this study extends the literature on corporate governance, tax avoidance and corporate debt.

Research Summary: Director retention is a common practice during acquisitions, whereby the acquiring firm adds at least one director from the target onto its board. Despite the regularity of the phenomenon, little is understood about the post-acquisition financial implications of director retention. In this exploratory study, we investigate the financial impact (via long-term investor value appropriation) of director retention in a sample of acquisitions among publicly traded firms. Our empirical analyses consistently illustrate negative financial ramifications of director retention for the acquiring firm across multiple analytic models, time horizons of performance, and samples. We delineate implications for research on boards of directors and acquisitions, and we offer preliminary theoretical logic and empirical analyses for future scholarship to elucidate the mechanisms driving antecedents and outcomes of director retention. Managerial Summary: Despite the prevalence of director retention--a practice where an acquirer adds at least one director from the target onto the board of the ongoing firm--research on the topic is equivocal about the financial implications of this practice. We argue this is a crucial oversight because new directors can have an incredible influence on the trajectory of the firm and its subsequent performance, a fact that is particularly true in the turbulent post-acquisition period. In our study, we empirically examine the impact of director retention on post-acquisition performance. Across multiple analyses and time intervals of performance, we consistently find that director retention is negatively associated with the performance of the acquiring firm. Accordingly, our findings suggest that acquirers should generally approach direction retention with caution. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In their pursuit to garner resources and support for their IPO, the issuing firms prepare well on all fronts. Corporate governance, specifically board structures, is a critical issue that affects the decision quality and also influences the investors' psyche. Building on theories of agency, resource dependency and signaling, this article attempts to study the effects of presence of foreign directors on firm-specific and board-related characteristics of IPO issuing firms. Adding to the scant literature on national diversity, this study concludes that foreign directors do signal a firm's intent of internationalization and contribute to strengthening corporate governance but national diversity does not translate into IPO returns. Exploring a sample of Indian IPOs issued from April 2001 to March 2017, this study finds that presence of foreign directors on the boards brings about differences in governance mechanisms wherein internationalized boards were found to be stronger on governance front. Larger boards, more committees, less number of related directors, better board interlocking were the benefits that manifested from presence of foreign board members. Issue size and issue price of shares at the time of IPO are found to be significantly higher for firms with foreign directors on their boards reflecting better acceptance among the investors.

Prior research has found that characteristics of the audit committee influence the incidence of financial restatements, as does demographic diversity on boards of directors. We draw upon work team diversity research to examine the impact of relations-oriented and task-oriented diversity in the audit committee on the likelihood of fraud-related and error-related financial restatements, respectively. We argue that these two types of demographic diversity work differently through greater vigilance of the audit committee in reducing the occurrence of financial restatements. Using a matched sample of fraud-restatement, error-restatement and non-restatement U.S. firms between 1996 and 2010, we find that relations-oriented diversity is associated with a lower incidence of fraud-related restatements, while task-oriented diversity is associated with a lower likelihood of error-related restatements. We also find that the involvement of audit committee members on other board committees moderates these relationships. We discuss the important role of work team diversity mechanisms in evaluating the effectiveness of board audit committees. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This study aims to explore corporate governance (CG) practices that can lead to firms' better performance in different organizational life cycles. The authors propose a configurational approach to explore how a set of CG practices combine in bundles to achieve high performance outcomes for firms across their corporate life cycles. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was used to analyze a sample of data of 21 countries and 9 industries. Data referred to the period of 9 years extending from the year 2005 to the year 2013. Findings: This study reveals that there are multiple CG practices that exist through firms that can achieve high firm performance. Moreover, CG practices combine in different ways for firms in their growth, maturity and declining stages. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles. Practical implications: The current study draws attention to the policymakers' need to assess the current level of regulatory and competitive development of their countries and form policy accordingly. The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Social implications: The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Originality/value: This study broadening the focus of CG studies to include a rigorous explanation of the global CG phenomena and to provide effective solutions for the practitioners. Contribution to Impact: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Ownership concentration remains a salient institutional feature among public listed firms in emerging and transitional economies. This study examines how a listed firm's ownership concentration interacts with its governance mechanisms in shaping corporate R&D investments. By analyzing panel data of Chinese listed firms between 2010 and 2012, I have three core findings. First, ownership concentration by the largest controlling shareholder negatively affects a firm's R&D intensity, but a small team of shareholders' ownership concentration plays a positive role. Second, a firm's monitoring mechanisms (measured by its sizes of the board and independent directors) and CEO stockholding positively affect the firm's R&D input. Third, CEO stockholding's positive role in promoting firm R&D is stronger in the firms with a more dispersed ownership structure. This study discloses the ways ownership concentration influences corporate governance and, in turn, affects corporate innovation. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The purpose of this study is to shed light on the effects of the CEO pay ratio and say-on-pay votes on directors' concerns about CEO pay equity. Investigation of the pay ratio disclosure rule offers opportunities to gain insights into whether equity perceptions associated with mandated pay ratio disclosure have significant effects on remuneration decisions in organizations. We conduct an online experiment with practicing corporate directors to examine the effects of CEO pay ratio disclosures and say-on-pay (SOP) votes on director decisions. Results indicate that CEO pay ratio disclosures significantly influence directors' decisions regarding executive compensation, leading directors to be less willing to increase CEO pay when the pay ratio is above the industry average pay ratio. Results also demonstrate that say-on-pay votes only influence directors' compensation decisions when the CEO pay ratio is above the industry average. Directors in firms with pay ratios that are above the industry average are less willing to increase CEO pay when they anticipate shareholder votes against a CEO pay increase than when they anticipate positive SOP voting outcomes. Directors in firms with CEO pay ratios that are below the industry average, however, are willing to increase CEO pay regardless of SOP voting outcomes. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

We investigate the nexus between board composition and corporate performance of Nigerian banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2010 to 2019. The contextual board characteristics of empirical interest include board size, financial knowledge of board members, frequency of board meetings, gender diversity and board independence. Corporate performance is measured by return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS). Our findings lead to the predictions that board size, financial nous of board members, gender diversity and board independence are important board characteristics that catalyse corporate performance, although the evidence of gender diversity and board independence is limited. We find no robust relation between the frequency of board meetings and corporate performance. Our findings affirm the plurality of governance theories. Although board characteristics are in aggregate perceived to be a strong determinant of firm performance, however, their disaggregation depicts differential effects on the performance of Nigerian banks. The study contributes to (a) empirical validation of theoretical pluralism to gain more insights into the dimensions of corporate governance, and (b) greater understanding of the nexus between board composition and corporate performance through the lens of both financial and nonfinancial factors. The fact that some board characteristics exhibit no or partial relations with firm performance suggests further research in and regulatory attention to the relations between board structure and optimal size for efficient corporate performance.

Corporate governance sits at the intersection of many disciplines, among them law, business, management, finance, and accounting. The point of departure for large portions of this literature concerns the ugliness of greed, ambition, misdemeanors, and malfeasance of corporations, their directors, and those actors who hold shares in them. This essay takes a rather different starting point. Drawing upon insights from a distant field, it uses the discussion of aesthetics in Dewey's treatise on art to ask what motivates directors to act in ways that constitute the attention and engagement that we associate with the effectiveness of boards. Using Dewey's thinking about aesthetic experience, this paper examines the experience of organization boards, both in the literature and in the personal experience of the author. These observations point to need to reflect on motivation when considering both the practice of corporate governance and the policy frameworks in which it operates. (c) 2020, The Author(s).

Using a sample of 47 Portuguese and Spanish firms for the period 2010 to 2017, the authors study the relationship between female presence on board and firm's accounting (ROA and ROE) and market-based (MTB and Tobin's Q) performance. They find that women on the board of directors is positively related to firm's performance, as well as the gender of the CFO and the proportion of women on the listed key professionals, when we consider the market measures of performance, not being so consistent for accounting performance measures. Results were sensitive to the performance measure used. The results reinforce the political options of European Commission gender established quotas, revealing that in the Iberian countries these quotas are not being effectively implemented, even if results suggest that women on board in fact exert positive influence over market performance. This also led us to think that financial markets may also react in a positive way when the CFO of the company is a woman instead of a man, despite the sample limitations both in terms of gender and number of firms.

Studies on the determinants of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation are very rich, and the management power theory (MPT) covers the existing study results. However, the academic circles still have not reached a unified opinion on the CEO compensation decision and theoretical basis. To explore the determinants of the structure of the CEO compensation level, the influence of MPT on CEO compensation decision factors was analyzed by using the meta-analysis from three aspects: Management power measurement, CEO compensation level and structure influence factors, and performance-compensation sensitivity. Results demonstrate that MPT has a significant predictive effect on the core variables of total cash and total compensation in CEO compensation factors. However, MPT has no significant effect on performance-compensation sensitivity, and a contested process exists between CEO power and board power. Moreover, CEO management power has cross-term utility in the CEO compensation decision-making process. When the board of directors has more power than the CEO, the board is more inclined to closely link CEO compensation to corporate performance, resulting in a higher proportion of CEO's risk pay and a lower proportion of cash compensation. This case continues until the CEO has the power to control the board, such as the CEO serving as the chairman of the board. CEO compensation levels are decisively influenced by MPT and have cross-term effects on CEO management authority. Conclusions are more sufficient than previous individual research findings, enrich the content of MPT, and make a positive contribution to management practice. (c) University of Latvia, 2002-2021.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

In this paper, the effect of gender diversity in board and independent audit teams on banks' earnings management behavior (EMB) is analyzed. I use the data of a sample of 308 firm-year observations that comprise of Turkish banking sector from 2003 to 2018, which is analyzed using panel least squares regressions. First, the null EMB of banks which operate in Turkey is tested. The relative effect of gender differences in the board of directors-BoDs and the independent audit teams on EMB is tested. Gender differences are proxied by the gender of the CEO (chief executive officer), the ratio of female members in the BoDs, and the gender of the lead auditor. The results reveal that banks manage earnings by using loan loss provisions. After testing EMB, gender effects are analyzed and implications are made. According to the results, the gender of both the CEO and the lead auditor has a significant effect on EM of behavior of the banks. The accrual level is higher, and EM behavior is constrained for companies audited by female lead auditors or female CEO board members. The multiple regression results of whole gender effects are mixed. The paper finds evidence of the mitigating effect of CEO's and lead auditor's gender on EMB. However, the evidence reveals that the board's female members' ratio is not associated with a propensity for earnings management. Results of the integrated analysis show that companies of which audited by female lead auditors and executed by male CEOS have higher loan loss provisions level that reverses the EMB of banks operating in Turkey.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

This exploratory qualitative inquiry examines the perspectives of 26 board members in medium-sized, privately held companies operating in the United Kingdom. The study question investigates how digital technologies (DT) are impacting on board director capabilities. Different board members' experiences from their own perspectives are examined, with attention on capturing the influence of digital technologies on the way that board directors work. Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors' capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm's interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper is an empirical study of the effect of the characteristics of the Sharia supervisory board (SSB) on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using 42 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Islamic banks outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and non-Islamic countries during the 2011/2018 period, a random-effects generalized lease square method for the regression analyzes is applied. Findings: The obtained results show that the characteristics of the SSB affect the financial performance of Islamic banks. The results also affirm that a large-sized board of directors and the number of SSB meetings improve banking performance while the cross-mandate seems to destroy it. On the other hand, the SSB members' competence and reputation and the proportion of women sitting in SSB have no impact on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives a comprehensive literature survey on the effect of the characteristics of the SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Practical implications: This study offers insights into the practitioner and Islamic banking regulators interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies that investigate the effect of the characteristics of SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks in particular in Islamic banks in the MENA region outside the GCC and in non-Islamic countries.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: In recent years, integrated reporting has emerged as a tool to provide environmental information in an interconnected way. However, in the academic literature, the amount of environmental information contained in integrated reports has never been analysed. This study, through the stakeholder-agency theory, aims to fill this important gap by examining the impact of the corporate governance mechanisms on the level of environmental information disseminated by the firms through integrated reports. Design/methodology/approach: A manual content analysis based on an environmental disclosure index consisting of 30 items was performed to measure the amount of environmental information. In addition, a regression analysis was performed on a sample of 129 international firms to examine the impact of the corporate governance mechanisms on the level of environmental information disseminated through integrated reports. Findings: The results show a positive effect of the board size, board gender diversity and corporate social responsibility committee existence on the level of environmental disclosure. Furthermore, they show a non-significant impact of board independence. Originality/value: This study enriches the literature in several ways. First, it extends the field of application of the stakeholder-agency theory. Second, this study extends the analysis of environmental disclosure to another document - the integrated report - still unexplored by academic literature. Finally, it shed light on the determinants of environmental disclosure. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper is an attempt to empirically examine the influence of corporate governance on zombie theory. Recent data indicates that the problem affects more than 10% of all firms and is worth close to a billion Euros in the European Union. It is thus an important problem worth analysing in European countries, and Spain is one of the worst affected. The sample studied here thus consists of Spanish companies with negative equity over the five business years from 2013 to 2017. The analysis focuses on establishing how corporate government aspects-board size, dedication to board meetings, concentration of ownership, owners and gender of the CEO-, affect the severity of extreme zombie firms. It uses the amount and temporality dimensions of EZIndex. The results confirm that internal dimensions such as corporate governance are important aspects to be introduced into zombie analysis. To control zombiness our results suggest structuring boards of directors with more than one member, CEOs with non-exclusive dedication, non-concentrated ownership and female CEOs. We also find that all these factors affect both amount and temporality, so factors do not affect zombie companies partially but totally. The contributions of the paper are twofold: first it includes corporate governance factors as a relevant approach for understanding zombie theory; and second, it encourages companies to manage risk-taking decisions efficiently so as to avoid the proliferation of zombies.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of board characteristics on environmental performance in manufacturing firms of the emerging East Asian markets. The authors adopt a triple perspective of environmental performance that focusses on three major environmental areas including resource reduction, emission reduction and product innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider three main board characteristics, namely, board size, board independence and board leadership structure, and investigate their impacts on a multidimensional construct of environmental performance. Specifically, both linear and quadratic functions are applied to address a possibility of the non-linear relationship between board size and environmental performance. The authors use fixed-effects estimations on a sample of manufacturing firms in the emerging East Asian countries between 2011 and 2016. Findings: The study explores an inverse U-shaped relationship between board size and environmental performance. The authors also reveal that manufacturing firms are more likely to have better environmental performance when the proportion of independent directors on board increases. However, the separation of CEO and board chair roles has no impact on environmental performance. Practical implications: The findings have important implications by identifying the role of a board of directors in implementing environmental protection strategies and by providing a foundation for corporate efforts to enhance sustainable development. Originality/value: The study provides complete understanding of environmental performance as a multidimensional construct and sheds light on the influence of board characteristics, especially the inverse U-shaped influence of board size, on environmental performance in the East Asian manufacturing industries.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study examines the effect of non-financial variables related to governance on the accuracy of financial distress prediction among Egyptian listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by using the logistic regression technique. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a sample of 24 Egyptian-listed SMEs in each year, totaling 120 firm observations, of which 25 were classified distressed and 95 of them non-distressed between 2014 and 2018. The variables for the study included five financial variables and thirteen non-financial variables related to governance. The models were developed using financial variables alone as well as combining financial and non-financial variables related to governance. Findings: The results showed that the model with financial variables had a prediction accuracy of 91.7%, whereas models with a combination of financial and non-financial variables related to governance predict with comparatively better accuracy of 92.7 and 93.6%. Research limitations/implications: Although the results seem to be conclusive, it could be noted that the non-distressed sample was not paired with the distressed sample. Other studies showed that paired samples increase the financial distress prediction rate. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, this study was unable to create a hold-out sub-sample for the accuracy test. Practical implications: The proposed distress prediction model for SMEs is effective for stakeholders, including banks and other financial institutions, in the assessment of the credit risk of SMEs. Using such a model, they could better identify SMEs with a higher risk of failure in their lending decisions. Moreover, SME managers' could be interested in using such models as a tool for planning corrective action, in addition to planning and controlling current operations to avoid financial failure in the future. Originality/value: This study contributes to financial distress prediction literature in different ways. First, few studies were conducted in the area of financial distress among SMEs. Second, neither of these studies was conducted within the Egyptian context, nor any of them had used non-financial variables related to governance in the prediction of financial distress among SMEs.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of the board of directors on the strategic decisions made by family firms, and to understand the board attributes that can alleviate the aversion of family-owned firms toward mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of several firms listed in India from 2006 to 2019 with 19,813 firm-year observations. The empirical tests have been performed using logistic and negative binomial regressions. The study also tests for endogeneity with the help of Heckman (1979) two-step treatment effects model. Findings: The study shows that board characteristics like smaller board-size, presence of outside directors, lower intensity of board activity, presence of busier board members and separation of board chair and CEO positions alleviate the inhibition of family firms toward M&A. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that investors and policymakers can encourage family firms to have smaller boards, more independent directors, passive boards and CEO nonduality to reduce their aversion toward risky activities. Family-owned firms could consider a board comprising members with multiple directorships who can bring wider knowledge and expertise which can reduce the perceived threat to socioemotional wealth (SEW) and alleviate their aversion toward M&A. Originality/value: Ownership concentration in family firms posits a unique challenge in terms of their aversion toward M&A. This study is one of the few that highlight the relevance of the monitoring and advisory role of the board in alleviating this aversion in an emerging market like India.

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: Despite the rather adequate physical and human resources available to Iranian state-owned enterprises (SOEs), they have proved not only unproductive and unprofitable but also corrupt in cases due to their corporate governance (CG) systems. This study aims to identify the most important challenges faced within designing, implementing and operating such systems in Iranian SOEs. Design/methodology/approach: A judgmental sampling technique was adopted for the purposes of the present qualitative study to select a heterogeneous group of interviewees in terms of experience and expert knowledge in CG and SOEs. Using 28 semi-structured interviews and the thematic analysis methodology within an exploratory approach, the themes/challenges were extracted from the data thus collected that were subsequently analyzed and explicated. Findings: The 16 challenges derived from the data set were subsequently classified into the four categories of "general assembly deficiencies", "contextual issues of ownership", "board deficiencies" and "external managerial constraints". Research limitations/implications: This study aims to provide insights into policy-making systems at both national and international levels to gain a better understanding of the contextual factors that could be exploited toward developing and/or reforming CG codes. To improve SOEs, this study also suggests four main solutions to the CG challenges faced within Iran and similar centralized economic planning systems. Originality/value: The literature on the topic indicates that while a few theoretical and empirical studies have been conducted on CG of SOEs, no study has ever been conducted on similar Iranian cases. The present study provides ample empirical evidence from the CG systems in a state-controlled and centralized economic system to offer new insights into the comparative CG, especially in a developing country like Iran, where the government is the major player in the economy.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Public corporations often appoint external former founders to their boards in hope that they will encourage a (re-)focus on creating future new business. Seeking to investigate this common practice, we integrate upper echelons theory with imprinting theory, arguing that founding a company indeed represents a formative experience that will leave an imprint on founders and their subsequent board decision-making. Subsequent to their founding experience, however, some founders may be subjected to likewise formative but public corporate experiences, for instance, by taking their own business public or by assuming CEO positions in other corporations, that will lead to a decay of the original founding imprint and its effect. We find support for our reasoning across corporate boards in S&P1500 firms ranging from 2000 to 2012. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The idea that a firm's degree of internationalization shapes its governance structure is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management and international business research. Sanders and Carpenter (Acad Manag J 41(2):158-178, 1998) was one of the first studies to comprehensively consider this phenomenon by finding that firms cope with the uncertainty of internationalization by granting CEOs higher and longer-term pay, constructing larger top management teams, constructing larger and more independent board of directors, and separating the CEO and chairman of the board positions. Given that firm governance structures have substantially changed over the past few decades, our study revisits these relationships by conducting a replication of Sanders and Carpenter (1998). Our results find general support for Sanders and Carpenter's (1998) central premise that internationalization shapes firm governance structures but also highlight important non-findings that reflect how the internationalization-governance relationship has changed since their study. Based on the findings of our replication, we also extend Sanders and Carpenter's (1998) framework and find that firms have more recently coped with the uncertainty of internationalization by hiring CEOs with international experience and hiring a more internationally diverse board of directors. We also provide insights on important boundary conditions of the non-replicated results in our study.

Firm leaders expect their chief marketing officers (CMOs) to have significant impact on firm performance, and boards of directors (boards) consider marketing-related issues critical board-level priorities. Despite the importance of marketers and marketing to firm outcomes, boards do not appear to value CMOs at the strategy-setting level of the firm as they rarely include CMOs in board discussions and deliberations. The disconnect between the importance of marketing and the marginalization of marketers at the board level prompts the following question: How and in what ways may boards impact CMO performance? This research includes two reviews of the extant literature (from 1984 through 2021): (1) board impact on CMOs, and (2) board impact on the satisfaction, performance, and outcomes of the broader top management team (TMT), including chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief operating officers, chief technology officers, and chief strategy officers. We find that only four articles investigate the impact of boards on any functional TMT member's performance and that none specifically consider how the board may impact CMO satisfaction, performance, and outcomes. Given the lack of research, we create a conceptual framework that links board characteristics to CMO outcomes and develop a research agenda with over 50 questions as the basis to develop scholarship. Importantly, this research highlights the paucity of insight regarding board-level influence on any functional TMT member, including the CMO. Consequently, the model and research agenda can benefit multiple disciplines including marketing, finance, information technology, operations, management, and human resources.

There have recently been many calls to explore corporate governance in emerging economies, as these countries have distinctive characteristics such as a weaker institutional environment and the dominating influence of controlling shareholders. The literature has revealed that, in such institutional settings, there is the risk that powerful insiders maximize their own benefits at the expense of minorities and firm performance. This study advances our knowledge of corporate governance in emerging economies by exploring the moderating impact of quad-qualified directors - i.e., directors with independence, expertise, bandwidth, and motivation - on the relationship between dominant-owner CEOs and firm performance. We tested our hypotheses on a large cross-sectional sample of Indian listed firms. Our results show that dominant-owner CEOs undermine company performance, but quad-qualified directors may improve board monitoring and consequently attenuate their negative influence. Our findings support the soundness of the quad-qualified model for boards of directors, and contribute to the growing literature investigating which directors' attributes may have a significant impact on board monitoring and firm performance.

Purpose: The study aims to yield evidence on the relation between the quality of governance characteristics and the firms' financial credibility involved in financial violations. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses annual data ranging from 2000 to 2018. The sample consists of 154 nonfinancial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, comprising 77 fraudulent and 77 non-fraudulent companies. To examine the relationship between improvements in the governance structure and financial credibility of the firms, hypotheses are tested using the univariate analysis and multivariate regression model through the ordinary least square method. Findings: The results affirm that fraud firms are possessed with poor governance structure compared to control firms in the pre-fraud year. The findings further imply that an improved governance structure brings foremost performance in stock price. The results of the study divulge that board of directors characteristic i.e. change in outside directors' percentage has a significant positive impact (b = 0.015, p = 0.05) on the financial credibility of the firms. The governance variables in terms of CEO-COB joint position has a significant negative (b = -0.824, p = 0.05) association with the financial credibility, which means that whenever CEO-COB joint position enhances, the financial credibility of the firms decreases. However, governance variables in the context of blockholders percentage has a significant positive (b = 0.13, p = 0.01) impact on financial credibility. The results of the study overall indicate that the governance structure has a significant influence on the financial performance of firms in the stock market. Originality/value: The study provides an understanding of how fraudulent firms rehabilitate their governance structure and accrue economic benefits by the means of financial credibility after when the fraud is made public. It also adds to the literature in the area of corporate frauds specifically the role of governance structure in the financial performance of fraudulent firms in the stock market; this field is in its initial stage, even in developed countries, while, in developing countries, little work has been done.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

Although acquisition strategies have been widely used by firms, past research has suggested that this type of strategic tactic can be risky, hence top management must justify this decision. Top management can engage in hubristic behaviors to do so. Therefore, we investigate if it is possible to identify the hubristic managerial before the decision is implemented, and how hubristic behaviors by the managers impact the long-term market performance of the firm. Using a sample of 11 596 firms over a span of 27 years, we found that managers actively manipulate firm performance prior to an acquisition, the degree of manipulation affects the degree of long-term performance, and the top management's decision to purchase the asset will negatively affect firm organizational performance. We contribute to organizational strategic decision-making literature by showing that managers may act with hubris in acquisitions decisions and that this hubris is predictable. Our results also suggest that top managers in pursuit of a corporate acquisition will need to justify their decision making to the board of directors by illustrating their success in managing the firm through high firm performance.

Purpose: The objective of this paper is to analyze in an international setting the relationship between environmental disclosures, carbon emissions and gender equality on the board of directors with the cost of equity (CoE) in the food and beverage sector. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample includes 142 listed firms and 1,562 firm-observations from 35 developed and developing countries between 2009 and 2019. The authors implement a fixed-effects regression model to contrast the impact of the three sustainable variables of interest on the CoE. Findings: The results of this study indicate that firms in the food and beverage industry benefit from a lower CoE due to better environmental disclosures and gender equality. On the other hand, carbon intensive firms are penalized with higher equity costs. Originality/value: This study expands prior research on the effects of sustainable behavior on the CoE in the food and beverage industry by taking into account additional sustainability variables and a greater number of observations, both from developed and from developing countries.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of board structure on voluntary environmental and energy disclosure of listed firms in Indonesia. The study employed a one-step and two-step system generalized method of moments using an unbalanced data panel of 356 non-finance companies. The findings showed that board size positively and significantly affected environmental and energy disclosure. Moreover, board independence negatively and significantly influenced environmental and energy disclosure, while women on board and CEO duality have an insignificant impact. The strategic implication showed that adding more members to the board of directors boosted voluntary environmental and energy disclosure. (c) 2022, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of shareholder activism as a change mechanism for improving gender diversity on corporate boards. We provide evidence that shareholders use both internal pressure through private negotiations that lead to a withdrawn proposal, and external pressure by submitting a proposal to vote in the annual shareholders' meeting to draw public attention. While both are impactful, we find that improvement in board gender diversity is more responsive to private negotiations than to social pressure. We also find that shareholders' votes in favor of diversity proposals are higher when a board is less diverse; but it's the very existence of a proposal that matters and not how many votes it receives. Finally, we find that proposals sponsored by institutional investors are more effective in bringing gender diversity to corporate boards. (c) 2020 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Women's representation on corporate boards has recently drawn increasing attention. This study aims to investigate the moderator role of females on the board of directors on the relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and stock price informativeness. This research uses secondary data obtained from the Sahra database with the span of 158 active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Findings indicated that the presence of female directors on the board had a favorable impact on the correlation between EQ and pricing informativeness. That is, firms with more female board members have a greater association between EQ and stock price informativeness. The practical application of this research relates to female CEOs' monitoring roles, thereby enhancing the quality of financial reporting. (c) 2022, Institute of Economic Sciences.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

The aim of this study is to determine the influence of gender diversity on the board of directors exert on corporate intellectual capital disclosure. This study uses financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2015-2018. Purposeful sampling was used in the sampling process. Supplementary data was obtained from the company's annual report that was got from the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Panel data regression analysis was used as the research method. We find that gender diversity is a complementary corporate governance mechanism that has a significant positive effect on levels of disclosure of IC information. This appears due to the presence of women on boards serving to prompt stronger monitoring and oversight behavior. This study contributes to the management accounting literature and upper echelon theory. The findings would be useful to Indonesian practitioners, especially those in management positions in financial companies and financial institutions. (c) 2022, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

This study investigates the relationship between various attributes of boards of directors on bank performance in light of Saudi corporate governance regulations. The data set of this study is extracted from the annual reports of all 12 banks listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) over a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. To test the study hypotheses, check the robustness of the results, and address potential endogeneity issues, this study applies different statistical methods, including FGLS, OLS, RE, PLCSE, and 2SLS, using STATA version 17. The results of multivariate analysis show that board size has a significant positive influence only on operational bank performance (ROA). For board composition, the results show that while board independence has a significant negative impact on accounting-based performance (ROA and ROE), it affects positively and significantly the market-based performance (Tobin's Q). Regarding board education, the results indicate that board members with at least a Bachelor's degree have a significant negative impact on ROA and ROE. In contrast, PhD holders on the board have a significant positive impact on ROA and ROE, while Master's holders affect positively and significantly all measures of bank performance. With respect to board diversity, only the CEO nationality has a significant positive effect on ROA and ROE. Board IT experience is found to be significantly and positively associated with ROA and ROE, while board meeting attendance has a significant positive influence only on ROE. These findings have important implications, especially for Saudi regulatory authorities to assess the current practice and compliance with the Saudi corporate governance regulations (SCGRs) and the principles of corporate governance for banks operating in Saudi Arabia (PCGB) regarding board characteristics and provide insights to improve board effectiveness and corporate governance practice in general.

In the third chapter, we empirically verify the impact of Corporate Sustainability (CS), measured through ESG rates, on Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) in family and nonfamily firms. Furthermore, the empirical analysis examines the moderating role of collegial leadership, a board characteristic that occurs when several executive members sit on the board of directors, on the link between firm sustainability and company performance. The work refers to the total sample of Italian companies listed on FTSE-MIB, the largest market dedicated to the most Italian capitalized companies, for the years 2015-2019. Our findings regarding the whole sample of firms show that CS rates do not affect the financial performance of Italian FTSE-MIB companies. By looking at the different ownership structures (family firms vs nonfamily firms), the econometric analyses indicate that higher CS rates are negatively associated with family firms' performance. The chapter concludes by showing that the negative relationship within family firm subsamples is positively moderated by the presence of more executive members on the board of directors of family companies.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

In the present study, we investigate the influence of corporate governance quality on the dividend policy of Asian emerging markets. First, we assess the level of corporate governance quality through a comprehensive index comprised of the combined board governance attributes (board of directors, ownership status, and progressive practices) and firm fundamentals through attributes of financial ratios. Then, using a sample of non-financial firms from the stock exchanges of the respective emerging markets (China, India, and Pakistan), our results depict firms' corporate governance quality as a relevant factor for dividend pay-out.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This article aims to summarise a significant number of previous qualitative and quantitative researches in order for scholars to reconsider their understanding of corporate governance mechanisms. The fundamental purpose of examining corporate governance practices is to define the way earnings management can be reduced. The findings show unclear conclusions concerning the board of directors' and the committee's characteristics on earnings management. That is why adopting corporate governance mechanisms strives for reducing the 'agency' problem. Furthermore, researchers can monitor the impact of corporate governance mechanisms by focusing on recent literature (2019, 2020, 2021). Future research in this area is therefore being promoted. Implementing corporate governance in companies is a given, as it can ensure their effectiveness and increase their credibility and prestige. Adopting corporate governance practices mitigates earnings management phenomena, and companies make the right decisions for their smoother operation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Our study focuses on the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of banks. Our basic idea is that several determinants of the board of directors could affect the profitability of banks. We conducted an econometric study using an estimate by panel data from a sample of 66 French banks observed over the period 2015-2019. Thus, our research aims to see more closely the nature of the relationship between these banks governance mechanisms and banking performance. The results demonstrated a positive and significant relationship between gender diversity and profitability. In addition, we found a positive impact of the independence of directors on profitability while the impact of the duality of the CEO has negative and significant effects on the profitability of the bank. We also use the Newey-West estimator and the method of weighted last square to confirm the relationship between corporate governance and banking profitability.

The current study examined the effects of corporate governance on the effectiveness of working capital management among Indian pharmaceutical companies. The study extracted data for ten years from 2008 to 2017 and the empirical analysis conducted was based on a large sample of 82 companies. The results of the current study revealed the number of directors on a board of directors negatively and significantly affects payables deferral period and receivables collection period, while composition of the board does not have a significant impact on the efficiency of working capital management. The current research is believed to be among the first to investigate the influence of corporate governance on the effectiveness of working capital management in an emerging economy, India. The study data should be beneficial for policymakers, investors, finance managers, and others concerned with the efficiency of working capital management.

Several authors have stated that the board of directors serve as the most crucial internal mechanism for improving a company's performance. On the other hand, prior studies argue that the board did not serve its purpose of safeguarding the stakeholders' interests equally and improving the performance of companies. It has piqued the interest of regulatory organisations all around the world, including in India. However, out of the several reforms introduced in India, board size is one of the most significant. As a result, the present study scrutinises the non-linear influence of board size on the performance of 213 Indian companies for 2001-2019. Tobin's Q and Return on Equity (ROE) are the study's performance metrics. The fixed effect panel regression findings depict that board size has an inverted U-shaped non-linear impact, i.e., initially, the performance improves, but after board size reaches a particular point, it diminishes. Thus, this study supports the recent changes made by the regulatory bodies about board size.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: This study aims to analyze the relationship between a firm's use of aggressive tax planning and board of directors (independence and size) and audit committee characteristics (independence and expertise). Design/methodology/approach: This study used archival data from 35 non-financial firms' French firms listed on the CAC 40 over a period of 5 years (2013-2018). Findings: This study shows that measures of board size are negatively related to tax aggressiveness. A broader board helps reduce tax aggressiveness, as having more members can improve board performance. Indeed, more members can contribute to a better assessment of tax risks and detect risky tax strategies. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the small sample. The authors limited the observations to 2018 because the corporate tax rate in France changed in 2019. Such a time window casts homogeneity on the current study. Examining universal registration documents, it has been noted that companies have only recently become interested in disclosure of tax risk. Practical implications: Knowing the characteristics of the board and audit committees can give a signal to stakeholders about the potential risk bearing on aggressive tax planning. This study provides evidence that could help the board governance committees integrate the right profiles and to raise awareness among the members of the board of directors and the audit committee to play their role (monitoring function or advisory function) about tax risk management. Originality/value: According to the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of the board of directors and audit committee characteristics on tax aggressiveness.

This study aimed at identifying the effect of board size and board gender diversity on dividend payout and identifying the role of return on assets (ROA) in moderating the effect of size and board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study population consisted of (45) service shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), during the period (2009-2018), using balanced panel data of (36) service companies with (360) observations. The results indicate that the level of female representation in the boards of service companies in Jordan is still low compared to other countries. The results also showed that board size and board gender diversity affect dividend payout. In addition, the return on assets moderates the effect of board size on dividend payout. The results also showed that the return on assets does not moderate the effect of board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study recommends that regulatory bodies should take a step towards encouraging gender diversity in boards to enhance board of directors' effectiveness, through amending legislations that regulate female participation in boards, such as the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Despite the increase in the number of studies analysing innovation in family firms over the last decade, there are still a number of critical issues that are far from being resolved. One of these issues is related to the influence of women's presence in corporate governance structures on firms' innovation outcomes. In light of this, the aim of the present chapter is to investigate whether the inclusion of women in private family firms' corporate governance structures, namely, in the general shareholders' meeting, the top management team and board of directors, influences firms' innovation. By applying regression analyses to a sample of 339 Spanish private family firms, the findings reveal that the presence of women in general shareholders' meetings and in top management teams has a negative and significant effect on innovation.

Purpose: Although being fired up about changes such as firm expansion, chief executive officers (CEOs) have a hard time with changes that involve divesting businesses or downsizing operations. This study aims to examine how a particular psychological process - regulatory focus - serves as a managerial exit barrier in the context of store closings in the US retail industry. This study also examines how a particular corporate governance mechanism, the board of directors, moderates the relationship between CEO regulatory focus and divestment activity. Design/methodology/approach: This study content-analyzed letters to shareholders to measure the regulatory focus of retail CEOs and used negative binomial regression to test the effect of the CEO's regulatory focus and board independence on store closure activity. Findings: The two motivation orientations - promotion and prevention - focuses have distinct effects on store closure decisions. As predicted, promotion-focused CEOs, who value attainment and growth, resist "pulling the plug." Conversely, prevention-focused CEOs, who are more sensitive to losses, are more inclined to close stores. Independent boards decrease the CEOs' resistance to "pull the plug" only when necessary, which is the case when CEOs have less vigilant tendencies. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the strategy and marketing literature. It examines an individual-level antecedent of store closure decisions and responds to the call for research on the effect of regulatory focus on divestment decisions. Practical implications: Leaders themselves can be a source of resistance to change. The findings suggest the importance of boards hiring CEOs psychologically aligned with the firms' strategic priorities. Promotion-focused CEOs may be a better fit for companies engaged in growth and acquisition. By contrast, prevention-focused CEOs may be a better fit for firms involved in retrenchment and restructuring. Independent boards still have the power to influence CEO decisions in the case of a misfit, as the findings suggest. Originality/value: This study examines divestment decisions during the "retail apocalypse" and provides empirical evidence for the existence of managerial exit barriers, first introduced by Michael Porter.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Family small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face both general bounded rationality challenges and a unique expression of bounded rationality in their internationalization process: the bifurcation bias, a concept aligned with modern transaction cost theory (TCT). We argue that efficient governance in family SMEs, and especially features of the Board of Directors' composition, can help alleviate bounded rationality. Complementing TCT with upper echelons theory (UET), we investigate which Board characteristics in family SMEs contribute to efficient governance and the ensuing strategy decisions. We focus specifically on strategy decisions in the internationalization sphere. Our empirical analysis of survey data from 328 Belgian family SMEs, operating out of a small open economy, reveals that family SMEs internationalize more if their Boards are 'open', 'inclusive', 'experienced' and 'active'. These Board characteristics, all reflective of efficient governance, i.e., providing the Board with the capacity to alleviate bounded rationality constraints, positively contribute to internationalization, especially (and perhaps paradoxically) when the family SME is managed by a CEO who is also a family member.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) on sustainability disclosure (SD) from the perspectives of resource dependence, agency and stakeholder theories in the context of Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses were based on 405 observations from non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange, spanning the period of 2014-2018. The CG that influences SD was examined using panel data regression models. Findings: The results of the current study show a positive and significant relationship between the extent of SG and the audit committee and board of directors' effectiveness. In terms of ownership structure, both institutional and foreign ownerships yielded an insignificant relationship with the extent of SDs. Practical implications: The analyses have implications for practitioners, policymakers, top management and corporate executives. Firms are encouraged to restructure their board of directors to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better monitor and support better SD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the determinants of SD in Jordan firms. This paper adopted a newly developed global reporting initiative-based reporting index that identifies companies with good sustainability practices. This adds value to the existing sustainability literature. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Two factors of board composition receive attention as they strongly relate to sustainability issues: gender diversity and board independence. The aim of this study is to test whether the presence of a critical mass of women in boardrooms correlates with firm ESG performance. In addition, we aim to study whether women receiving appointment as executive rather than nonexecutive directors may positively influence ESG performance. Using a sample of Italian companies listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario during 2003-2019, the empirical results show that a critical mass of at least three female directors is necessary to improve ESG performance and that executive women directors represent a crucial component of board mechanisms, in terms of aligning the needs of stakeholders, since they increase ESG performance. Because the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value, we support the idea that female directors in strategic positions in the boardroom may benefit ESG performance. Thus, we support the idea of increasing women's presence on corporate boards and across executive leadership as a measure and a signal of how firms can respond to ESG challenges.

The current study looked at the impact of board of director characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Pakistani setting. The study further added to the body of knowledge by comparing the impact of board characteristics in family versus non-family businesses in an emerging market. The study's sample consists of 139 non-financial Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) listed firms from 2008 to 2019. The level of CSR among sample firms was assessed using a multidimensional financial approach. The random-effect model was employed to test the study's hypotheses. The findings support the dysfunctional view of the role of the board of directors' in family-owned businesses. Overall, board size and CEO duality have a significant negative impact on CSR, whereas board independence has a significant positive impact. While these findings applied to both family-owned and non-family-owned businesses. It was discovered that among family-owned businesses, boards tend to look after the interests of family members, and thus are less likely to support CSR. The findings of this study will assist regulatory authorities, investors, and financial analysts in understanding CSR practices in Pakistani firms, allowing them to review the role of the board of directors in CSR among family and non-family-owned firms.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

For over four decades, the topic of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation has attracted considerable attention from the fields of economics, finance, management, public policy, law, and business ethics. As scholarly interest in CEO pay has increased, so has public concern about the ethics of high CEO pay. Despite growing interest and pressure among the public and government to reduce CEO pay, it has continued to increase. Using a multi-method design incorporating a pilot study, two online experiments, and an event study, we investigate the impact of CEO pay on consumer purchase intent and find that this negative relationship is magnified under conditions of brand crisis. We also find that the negative interaction of high CEO pay and brand crisis on purchase intent is more negative when the brand has strong equity. Finally, when the CEO is awarded high pay while the firm they manage is undergoing a brand crisis, consumers lose trust in the firm's brand which reduces consumer purchase intent. This research provides insight on how governance decisions can impact consumer perceptions of corporate brands and consumer behavior, with implications for public policy leaders, boards of directors, CEOs, and Chief Marketing Officers regarding how to manage and message CEO pay.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

Purpose: In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, this article aims to analyze the resilience of family businesses in a developing country like Cameroon. As such, this study seeks to fill two gaps in the literature: first, by comparing the financial and social performance of family companies with those of non-family companies not listed on the stock exchange, and second, by comparing performance across family-run companies, according to the companies' mode of leadership in Cameroon, a developing country affected by COVID-19 like the rest of the world. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, the authors developed empirical models to identify the variables which influence the financial and social dimensions of business performance. These models were tested with multilinear regressions, using data collected from questionnaires distributed to 466 firms, of which 212 were family firms and 254 non-family firms. The authors completed our analyses with mean comparison tests to demonstrate whether our results are significantly different between family and non-family firms. Findings: The authors' multiple regressions and tests produced two main results - the financial and social performance of all Cameroonian firms declined sharply during the crisis, and with the firms' financial performance hit hardest, family firms have been more resilient to the crisis in terms of financial and social performance than non-family firms. The weak governance and social protection system, as well as an inefficient legal system, do not seem to negatively affect the performance of these Cameroonian firms - the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of family firms were better managed in firms where family members are actively involved in management or control through family members' strong representation on the board of directors (BD). Research limitations/implications: The two main limitations of this study concern the governance of these companies included and the failure to take the characteristics of the manager into account. Investigating other governance variables, such as the composition of the BD or the participation of employees in the capital, would enable us to refine the authors' interpretations of the companies' financial and social performance. Another limitation is the fact that the characteristics of the manager were not considered, especially when the manager is a family member. Exploring this variable would make studying the generational aspect of family businesses possible. Practical implications: Family companies are more resilient to crisis because of the companies' long-term focus, which also encourages the companies to maintain the companies' social policy and to avoid redundancies as far as possible. Weak systems of governance and social protection, as well as an ineffective legal system, do not negatively affect the performance of Cameroonian family companies. The results also suggest that family shareholders should become more involved in the management and control of family's firms to make the firms financially and socially resilient and in so doing drastically reduce the impact of crises. Social implications: This study shows, in particular, how family firms are more socially resilient than other firms in times of crisis (by resorting less often to redundancies). Family firms should, therefore, arguably benefit the most from public support during crises. Originality/value: The authors' research makes two main contributions to the literature on family businesses. The results first of all show that Cameroonian family firms have thus far performed better financially and socially during the COVID-19 period than non-family firms. Second, this research focuses on differences in performance based on family business management types during this specific crisis period. The results suggest that the most resilient family firms, in terms of performance, are those in which the family is involved in the management or control of the BD.

In this chapter, the impact of board gender diversity on overall firm risk was investigated. Drawing on social identity theory, upper echelons theory, and agency theory, a hypothesis of a negative link between gender diversity on the board of directors and firm risk has been put forward. Using a panel data regression on a sample of large Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) over the period 2016-2020, the author was able to provide empirical evidences supporting the existence of a significant negative impact of the percentage of women on boards of directors on stock return volatility as global firm risk proxy.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

From an agency perspective, the Anglo-Saxon features of corporate governance are predominantly explored by various studies in extant literature. However, it has recently been established that diverse and unique institutional configurations exist in different economies across the world and hence, the attitude of different actors within a firm, as shaped by institutional logics, can vary. Our study applies the institutionalized agency perspective to understand how the behaviour of different actors, within firms in the Indian institutional context, are shaped, consequently determining their roles in the strategic decisions of firms. We examine the representation of lenders in the board of directors, which is a characteristic of corporate governance in India. Our sample for this study consists of 985 unique Indian firms and 5513 firm year observations across the 2006-2017 time-period. We find a negative association between the proportion of lender representatives on board of directors and internationalization of firms. In addition, we also find that family ownership positively moderates this relation, whereas foreign institutional investors and domestic banks and financial institutional investors moderate this relationship negatively. In this manner, we explore the impact of institutional environment on a very specific actor (lenders) and their representatives towards internationalization. (c) 2021, The Author(s).

The article focuses on the implications of women directors for strategic disclosure by exploring their influence on the quality of business plan in terms of information comprehensiveness. To this aim, by using hand-collected data and combining content analysis with OLS regression, it examines a sample of publicly listed non-financial Italian firms. Findings show that, while the presence of a critical mass of women on board negatively influences the quality of business plan, women CFOs positively affect such strategic planning tool. Therefore, by showing that women directors influence the quality of one of the most effective strategic planning and communication tools, the study extends the research on the role of women for the strategic decision-making process and outcomes. It also enriches the literature on the determinants of the business plan and strategic disclosure by exploring how women directors prompt the related quality. Following the recent increasing attention of policy-makers towards the necessity to foster the women's involvement in company activity that has been also strongly pushed by the socio-economical COVID-19 consequences, the article informs firms and practitioners about the beneficial implications of appointing women in apical positions for the level of company strategic disclosure quality.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

The board of directors' behavioral dynamics can strongly influence an entrepreneurial firm's success. Drawing on the behavioral theory of corporate governance, this study identifies and tests factors that facilitate behavioral integration in boards of high technology start-ups. We unpack the black box of board behavior with primary data collected from a survey-based sample of 149 CEOs of Norwegian high-tech start-ups supplemented by quantitative archival information. We find that intra-board behavioral integration (i.e., board members' propensity to clearly understand one another's issues and needs, actively solve, and share relevant information and resources) is positively affected by greater levels of informal communication between CEOs and board members. Next, we find that inter-board trust (i.e., board members interact with absolute integrity, tell the truth at meetings, trust one another, and keep mutual promises) mediates this relationship such that higher levels of inter-board trust result in greater concordance between information communication frequency and inter-board behavioral integration. We then examine the role of an efficacious board chair who motivates and uses each board member's competence, formulates proposals for decisions and summarizes conclusions after board negotiation, and chairs board discussions without promoting their agenda, finding that efficacious board chair leadership moderates the relationship between informal communication frequency and intra-board trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Drivers of environmentally conscious firm behaviour have gained increasing attention over past decades. The Board of Directors holds a central role in corporate decision-making, and previous empirical evidence suggests that its characteristics could influence corporate environmental performance. This paper contributes to the literature with the first evidence of the influence certain board characteristics have on whether a firm ultimately supports one or more environmental SDGs. Our focus is on board size, gender diversity, board independence and CEO duality. Logistic and fractional regressions on 4417 globally listed firms highlight that board size, the share of female directors, and the share of independent directors are significant drivers of support for environmental SDGs. The results and insights revealed in this study should be helpful to policymakers, investors and corporations in evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance characteristics and fostering corporate contributions to the 2030 Agenda.

Our paper analyses the characteristics of the boards of directors of the best performing listed Italian banks during the last global financial crisis (from 2008 to 2015). Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the study identifies three different board configurations (archetypes) that these banks adopted: a committee-based board, a gender diversity-based board, and a large size-based board. Although different in some of their characteristics, these configurations share the rationale of favouring the advisory services that the board can provide to managers in their decision-making activities. These services, in turn, are particularly valuable in a time of high risk and uncertainty for banks. With its results, the paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between board characteristics and organisational performance and to a better understanding of the configurations that can best serve when firms' decision-making, for various reasons, becomes particularly complex and can benefit from board support. Our results also contribute to further detail the governance characteristics of banks in the Italian context. Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

The main objective of the present study is to investigate the board of directors' diversity impact on banks' financial performance. The analysis was made on the Romanian bank system, during 2019 - 2020. The board of directors' diversity was measured through the presence of the woman in the board of directors' structure, average age and the nationality of the board members and the profitability of the bank system was analysed by using the financial indicator ROA (return on assets). The research methodology used was mostly quantitative, with the authors performing a deductive statistical analysis by using a series of testing objectives and potential cause-effect links. The findings of the paper indicate that there is a direct correlation between the board of directors' members average age and ROA, in 2019, and an indirect link with a low intensity between the members' nationality and the bank's profitability, in 2020. Our results provide no evidence for the presence of women on boards of directors and the banks' financial performance. (c) Vilnius University, 2002-2023.

Debt holders monitoring influence on the business performance has been noted in several research. Another body of research investigates the board of directors and performance linkages. The impact of debtholders on the board composition and firm performance linkage, particularly in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), has received little attention in the literature. As a result, this article aims to determine whether the composition of Indian SOE boards has an impact on their performance. It also looks into how leverage influences the association between the composition of Indian SOE boards and their performance. From 2001 to 2019, the panel data regression is performed on 19 Indian SOEs registered on the Bombay Stock Exchange. According to the study, board size, nominee directors improve Indian SOE performance, while independent directors reduce performance. Furthermore, in high-leverage SOEs, board of directors' supervision is reduced or removed. The findings have implications for policymakers and the government. (c) 2023 K.J.

This study aimed to demonstrate the impact of corporate governance principles on financial performance in Jordanian family companies. The study population consisted of industrial companies listed in the Amman Stock Exchange during the period (2014-2018). Corporate governance was measured by: (the size of the company's board of directors, the separation of the positions of the chairman and the CEO, the independence of the board members and the percentage of ownership of major shareholders), while the financial performance was measured using financial ratios (profitability and liquidity) and the size of the company and leverage were used as adjusting variables. The study sample consisted of (34) family-owned industrial companies listed in the Amman Stock Exchange out of (51) companies with a percentage of (66.6%) of the total number of industrial companies. The method of multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable, in addition to measuring the degree of interpretation of the independent variables of the variation in the dependent variable. The results of the study showed that there is a statistically significant impact of the implementation of family-business governance (the size of the board of directors, the separation of the positions of the chairman and the CEO, the independence of the members of the board of directors and the percentage of ownership of major shareholders) on the profitability ratio and the liquidity ratio being among the dimensions of financial performance. Corporate-governance variables in the study indicated that 81.4% of family businesses in Jordan apply corporate-governance principles and there was a statistically significant effect of the adjusting variables (company size and leverage) on the profitability and liquidity ratio in family businesses. The study recommended the importance of applying the principles of corporate governance in family companies that have not fully implemented the principles of governance, because of their positive and significant role in enhancing their financial performance.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance-firm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets.

In this study, I examine the role racial minorities in the boardroom can play in reducing social injustice by promoting more equal access to mortgage credit to minority households. I develop a simple theoretical model that posits directors who are racial minorities provide the credit unions they govern with a perspective that shapes lenders' trust of minority applicants. This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants. (c) The Author(s) 2021.
